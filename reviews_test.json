              "body": "The media could not be loaded. I did a ton of research before buying a robo vac. This is perfect and I can’t understand how or why any additional technology would be needed or why I’d want to pay more for it. This vacuum gets the house so clean and the self empty is absolutely necessary so you don’t have to worry about it not getting a full cleaning in because it gets too full. It just goes to the base, empties itself and then goes back to its last location. My biggest concerns in buying one of these were a vacuum that constantly got stuck on things and a vacuum that missed cleaning areas if furniture was in a slightly different location. This vac is fantastic, cleans every inch of my home, transitions from hardwood to carpet with no problems and I’m amazed at the areas it fits itself into so it can clean. It gets under my dish washer and fridge, transitions on and off my marble near the fireplace and handles our welcome mats without issue. It also seems to have a certain level of intelligence where it has gotten more confident in certain areas of my home. Set up and mapping was so simple. Another cool feature is that you can update your map at any time to add different rooms or change dimensions. For example I have an open kitchen/family room. At first I labeled that area as 1 room. I then edited and created 2 rooms so that I can select just one of those areas if I want to get an individual area cleaned at any given time.  Let me address some of the negatives I read in reviews. Noise- not too noisy, when emptying it’s a little loud for about 6 seconds, no big deal. Battery life- no problem for me. I can spot clean any time I want. I have it scheduled to do a full clean at 12:00am every night. As a result it doesn’t matter if it stops to charge in between cleanings. App limitations- not a problem for me, I prefer the simplicity. You can on demand have it clean one room or multiple rooms with the touch of a button. You can have it spot clean an area by touching the area on the map. Scheduled cleaning- only lets you schedule all rooms, you can’t schedule just 1 room. Not a problem. I select rooms as needed throughout the day, for example if kids were messy at lunch I select kitchen. But I like that it cleans my entire first floor every night. Also while it’s cleaning you can alternate the power which is nice. Bin storage- some people say it won’t last 45 days, I’m not gross enough to let it sit for 45 days. But there is more than enough space to not worry about it overfilling if I’m on vacation for a while. Otherwise we tend to empty it every couple days because we love seeing how much dirt it collected lol.  In review, this is the best product at the best value. Anything more expensive isn’t needed because this gets the job done (amazing cleaning without getting stuck on things). Anything cheaper I wouldn’t have confidence in cleaning power/navigating. I rarely leave Amazon reviews but based on all the research I did I felt I should pass this info along to all of you.",

              "body": "The media could not be loaded. I love this vacuum! I have two dogs that shed a lot so I vacuum 1-2 times a day. My old robot vacuum didn’t have the self emptying base or sense when it was full, so I had to empty its container every 15 minutes and if I forgot, it would keep running without picking up anything. The self emptying feature on my Shark is excellent! If it gets full mid-clean, it goes back to the base to empty itself and then returns to where it was cleaning. I empty it about once a week (instead of every 45 days like the listing says), but someone without pets would probably be able to empty it less often.  It has great suction but it’s pretty quiet. It does a thorough cleaning job and gets the corners decently. The battery life is decent. On the normal mode, it’ll do my 1000 sq ft condo in one charge. There are also MAX (stronger) and ECO (lighter) suction modes, but I haven’t tried those. The vacuum doesn’t “clean by braille” like older robot vacuums used to do, bumping into everything to determine where walls and obstacles were. This guy seems to be able to “see” his surroundings.  The app works great and I love that I can see the battery life and tell my Alexa to send my robot to clean a specific room. The vacuum starts by making a map of your home and then you label each room so it knows where to go. There is one drawback: it has to sense the whole house in one trip. This means you can’t map multi-story homes (not a problem for me, but it is for friends who have 2-story homes). When it made the map of my house, I had a room closed off for storage that I didn’t need it to clean, but I’ve now made the room into an office. Instead of adding the room to my map, I have to erase the old map and send the robot around to map the whole house again, and then reassign the room boundaries.  Another drawback is that the Alexa integration is a little clunky, in that it always asks for the robot name even though I only have one vacuum.  “Alexa, ask Shark to start cleaning the living room.” “Which robot?” “Bruce.” “Okay, your robot is now cleaning.”  Alexa doesn’t recognize the request if you ask using just the robot name (“ask Bruce to clean the living room”). I wish they would eliminate the extra question when you only have one robot. Not a big deal but it is annoying.  Overall I’m very happy with my vacuum and it’s saved me a lot of time and effort that I used to spend keeping dog hair under control.",

              "body": "I’m about to give birth and have three shedding dogs (40 lb cur, 95 lb lab mix, 60 lb hound/lab mix). My cur and 95 pounder are blowing coat and no amount of brushing saves my floors. I alternate between vacuuming and brushing them daily. We don’t have any family around to help out with chores after baby is here which will leave my poor husband a 5 acre plot of land, a house, three dogs, and a wife/baby to tend to all by himself for a little bit. I also can barely get anything done since I have to vacuum every other day right now. My poor cankles!  Out of desperation I gave this a try since it was on sale and, God bless America, this is the best thing ever.  Ill start with cons since thats what most people really want to know:  Wifi was tricky to connect BUT the best place for the base in my home is on the opposite side of the house from the modem. I could have moved it closer if all else failed but after a good 20 minutes of trial and error, I got it connected. After that, the app was very user friendly i found.  My dogs have a little water spillage by their bowl so hair sometimes sticks from the roller into those spots but its a small space and doesn’t bother me. I usually do a whole house pick up before I start it anyways.  Because of the immense amount of hair this thing picks up, I empty it weekly. Again, not a big deal to me.  PROS:  Literally everything. It does a really good job at mapping my house. It gets in corners shockingly well. Its not perfect but if it misses a spot, you can send it on a “spot clean.” This model doesnt have lots of bells and whistles. No mopping feature, not super silent. However, that usually means it does one thing very well and that is vacuum. Thats all I wanted. Something to pick up dog hair and dirt from dogs and husband. While its not dead silent, its way quieter than my giant Shark pet hair vacuum. I also don’t need something totally quiet. A baby can definitely sleep through it. Its more like white noise to me. And you can adjust the volume of the base from the app. No dog hair has gotten stuck in the rollers but if you find Sharky is leaving behind clumps of hair, you probably need to empty out the base.  Note: I have only hardwood and tile flooring. It goes over the mat by the door very well thus far but keep in mind I have no real say in if this is great for a mostly carpeted home.  If you have dogs, are a new mom, or just don’t want to waste your precious weekends vacuuming, you want this. Trust me, you do.",

              "title": "All around great robot vacuum",
              "body": "TL;DR: This robot vacuum is awesome and worth every penny. Highly recommend this vacuum to everyone, my wife agrees! Happy wife, happy life! Might buy another for my upstairs. For a robot vacuum, it does what I expect and makes my life easier. I don't make it pick up large debris, robot vacuums seem to perform best with small debris. Large debris may get stuck or caught. Lidar works phenomenal, but with some hiccups when mapping house (mostly human error). Routing around obstacles works well, slows around objects and if anything is bumped it's so light and cushioned, it's not a problem. 5 stars overall. 4 stars deep cleaning and suction leaving room for improvement, it's a robot vacuum, what do you expect? Probably has Alexa integration, but I use Google assistant and it works great!  ---  I ordered this back in July 2022 and got it end of the month. I waited some time to let the excitement die a little before posting a review, but it never really did. This is my first robot vacuum and one of the best purchase decisions I have made this year. When researching for the right robot vacuum, I found that most of the highly rated vacuums don't seem to make it past 6 months or a year when reading reviews. Also manufacturers seems to make new models every year, so finding something that is reliable and lasts longer than this timeframe is hard to find. Of course, I am only onto my 5th month of owning this vacuum.  When I broke the vacuum out of the box, my first inclination was to take it out and get it started. But thinking about the other reviews I have read on this vacuum and others like it, I wanted to read the instructions first. This is not a regular vacuum that you plug in and push. It has lots of little parts that make it different and potentially not taking care of it properly could damage the device. So anybody reading this, read the instructions first. Understand how to properly take care of it and clean it. Also, comparing to other reviews, clean it regularly.  Now for my somewhat long review:  Is it quiet? Yes and no. It is a robot vacuum, how loud do you expect it to be? You're not doing the work, but it is. It is quieter than a regular vacuum, but no idea how quiet other robot vacuums are. If a robot vacuum is loud or quiet, who cares? What matters is that it can clean stuff.  Can you watch tv while it runs? Yes you can watch tv. Just turn up the volume a little, no need to blast it like when running a normal push vacuum.  Can it pick up everything? No, it's a robot vacuum. Don't put too much trust in it. What I typically do is remove all obstacles (cords, bags, blankets) from the ground and any larger debris that might get caught in the motors (cotton balls left from the dog, pieces left behind from chewed up toys, strings from rope toys).  Dog hair? My dog constantly sheds, but has short hair. I run it twice per week on thin carpet and once per week on hard floors. I don't notice the dog hair until I see what the vacuum picked up and it does a great job! The majority of stuff this picks up is dog hair and a lot of it. For longer haired dogs or thicker haired dogs, I assume this will get the job done as long human hair doesn't get stuck at all like my regular vacuum does.  Small leaves? It picks up small leaves and debris similar size, but may leaf some behind. It also might get caught in spinning brushes and make a slightly louder noise on hard floor. I waited for it to finish and then pulled the leaf out, no harm.  Dog kibble? Ok this one was an accident, didn't see it against the brown colored floor before starting vacuum. Sounded like the robot was choking and about to die, literally. I had to stop it right away and retrieve the small rock sized (width of thumbnail) dog food from the vacuum.  Can you run it when away from home? I read too many horror stories of vacuums cleaning pet poop, but it is not the reason I don't start it when I'm not home. Like the last two points, if something gets caught, you need to be there to fish it out. I may have spot checked the floor, but even that sometimes isn't good enough. Also, one time a week or two ago, it finally got confused and couldn't move past a futon leg. It kept spinning back and forth (maybe for 5 minutes) until I nudged the futon half an inch, then it broke free of its endless loop. This was the only time this ever happened since I got it. Every other time it does an excellent job of finding its way through, even finding its way through a jungle of table and chair legs.  Lidar mapping floorplan? Simply amazing! I had it map 4 different rooms. The first time was great, but missed a few minor areas, of which was my fault. I left things on the floor and in the way of the robot when it mapped the floorplan. The second time, I removed the obstacles, but it didn't map another room properly. The third time, I removed a chair, which the robot vacuum had just enough clearance to fit under (1st time it went under, 2nd time it did not), so that it can map that area of the carpet and not count it as a wall.  Lidar in general? It works great to avoid obstacles and get around legs of any sort. Only thing is if the leg is curved, like my kitchen table, it doesn't know when to properly maneuver around it. But no worries! The bumper is amazing! It lightly bumps in to obstacles and the vacuum does a minor adjustment to figure out how to go around it.  Damaging furniture? Nope! Doesn't happen. The robot is so careful around obstacles and even when it does bump things, its lightly bumps it and doesn't scratch or anything. When it approaches obstacles (walls or furniture) it moves at a slower pace. This thing is intelligent.  Suction? For a robot vacuum, it does everything it needs to and does it very well. There are different levels for suction in the app, I have only needed to use the normal section. The max suction I have never needed to use, but it is an option if things get too out of hand. There is also an ultra clean option, not tried it, but think it just spends more time going over stuff. If I ever try ultra clean option, maybe need to change deep clean star to a 5, but I'm making the assumption that it will never perform as well as a normal vacuum.  Battery? I run two rooms per day I run it, but sometimes do all 4 rooms when I forget to run it. It lasts easily to finish all 4 rooms with charge left over. I'm guessing lowest percentage of battery life was 35% or 40% after doing all 4, this is a wild guess though, could've been higher. For 2 rooms it's usually at 60% after it's done, that I know for sure.  Emptying? It has a bin that it empties to. If the robot either runs for too long (or not sure if it senses if it is full of junk) it may return to the docking station to empty itself. This system works great, but the bin needs to be cleaned out occasionally. There is also a filter in the bin system that needs to be cleaned, just like regular vacuums may have.  App? No issues running it on my Android. Can select rooms and see the layout easily. Drawing rooms works great as well!  Robotiness? It makes all the noises a robot vacuum should and it's awesome! Just thought you should know! Beep boop boop!  Ratings: I give it 5 stars because as it is a robot vacuum, it meets all of my expectations. 4 stars on deep cleaning and suction because it isn't perfect, but is excellent as a robot vacuum. I haven't used my regular vacuum in the areas that this one runs because it seems to do such a great job. Integration with Google works great! I don't use Alexa with this one. Again, this is one of the best purchases I made this year. Definitely recommend this vacuum to everyone. Don't spend $1k on something else.",

              "title": "UPDATED -- app only gets worse and ruins an otherwise good product",
              "body": "UPDATE 9/27/2024 AFTER ~2 MONTHS OF USE  As a vacuum I continue to love this device. It's app enrages me more every single day and I'm about to simply put it in the attic because without the app it becomes increasingly useless; I wish I could take away more stars this app is so bad. I'm hoping SharkNinja cares enough to read these reviews and actually takes action, otherwise they may go the way of Sonos with their horrible app decisions. This isn't 2005 when iRobot could do stupid things and get away with it because there was no competition. While I'm not one to throw money away, I will replace this with something else that actually works and doesn't need an app to do simple scheduled cleaning runs. I could give two hoots about whether it has a \"map\" at this point, just clean the doggone floor -- do the basic thing you claim to be able to do and do it well. Is that so hard?  I'm guessing they don't care given they can't seem to do simple things like when I log into their website with exactly the same credentials I use in the app, it doesn't show my registered products, or when I scan the QR code in the app to store the Model and S/N it can't store it for more than about 5 minutes before it literally just disappears. If you can't do simple things, complex ones are probably out of reach.  The system has some kind of serious software bug in it related to map storage. I work for a software company, and all the signs are present that there is a significant problem with the storage system for maps and/or the communication between the app and the robot relating to the map. I say this because our robot just lost its map one day about a month ago. No errors, no problems running, it just literally disappeared. The schedule continued to run, so I didn't notice it until I looked at the cleaning notification one day and noticed that it was reporting a run time of almost 2 hours (which sounded about right) but a 0 ft squared cleaned. It sure made a lot of noise and picked up a lot of dirt for not cleaning any square footage of my first floor! When I dug into the app, the map was gone. Just not there. When going into settings to look at the map, I just get the infuriating purple spinner. No messages, no indicators of a problem, just a total lack of communication about what is going on and no map.  So I set about the task of trying to correct the problem. First, I delete the map and go to try and re-explore. It seems to delete, and it will run an exploration run, but then it just sits with that obnoxious purple spinner and the question about whether the map represents the home properly or should it re-explore, with the Accept button greyed out and NO OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE. I've re-explored 20 times and left it sitting on that screen overnight for 8 hours with it never finishing. Ever. And this is why it's about to become trash!!! Without running the explore successfully, you can't set the schedule! You can't run a manual cleaning run with the app! If I wanted a vacuum I had to physically go push the button on, I could have bought something a heck of a lot less expensive (which is what I'm likely to do at this point).  SO then I thought, like most technology of this sort, it might just need a complete fresh start. Stuff happens, memory gets corrupted and needs wiped, no problem. So I deleted the robot from the app and had to go through the mind-numbing and excruciating process of re-joining to my post 1995 WiFi network which is too fancy and elaborate with its new-fangled 5GHz technology for these developers to figure out (or Shark is too cheap and obsessed with profits to use a more modern WiFi SoC). Go through that process and run the explore another 10 times with no change.  Then I reset to supposedly factory settings. Same result. Same absolute rage-inducing nonsense getting it to connect to the WiFi (though I think I finally figured out the trick on that). I am not convinced it actually DOES reset to factory settings or wipes the memory clean, because I'm continuing to have the same problem. Exploration simply will not finish successfully and so I can't schedule or make it clean without having to go under the table and push the button. Total ridiculousness. A factory reset should restore a copy of the firmware as it was when it came out of the factory -- and mapping worked out of the box. Now it doesn't. I am left with the conclusion the reset does NOT actually reset the memory.  This is just infuriating. Oh, and before you say \"contact support\". I have. Crickets and bullfrogs, ladies and gentlemen. So far, crickets and bullfrogs. If that changes, I'll post a new update, though.  Message to SharkNinja -- when you released an app, you became a software company. That has certain requirements and sets certain expectations. You are FAILING to meet any of them.  +++ HOW TO DEAL WITH MODERN WIFI AND THIS RIDICULOUS TWELVE CENT WIFI CHIP +++  The key to making this work is whether your phone is trying to access the Internet or any from anything other than the same 2.4GHz connection this unit is using. So what I have to do:  1. Log into Eero and turn of 5GHz (on my version this is under troubleshooting; nearly every mesh single-SSID system has a mechanism to temporarily disable 5GHz b/c this cheapness is so prevalent in so many devices) 2. Turn WiFi off on phone and leave off for a couple of minutes (this is a precaution to make sure 5GHz is truly not picking up the connection) 3. Turn mobile data off on my phone (airplane mode didn't cut it 2 out of 3 times; turning off mobile data always worked) 4. Turn WiFi back on and make sure Bluetooth is on; if you tried airplane mode and left bluetooth off and don't turn it back on again until the app prompts you, you're hosed and will have to start over from the beginning - I experienced this multiple times 5. Put robot into discovery mode 6. Connect to the robot and go through the unnecessarily plentiful prompts full of stupid and useless information in the \"wizard\" 7. When you get to the network selection screen, your WiFi network SSID should show up --- if it doesn't, one more thing to do is go into your phone WiFi settings and join your 2.4GHz network (keeping the Shark app in the background), which will disconnect you from the WiFi Direct connection with the robot; let it connect fully; then go disconnect from your access point and reconnect to the robot WiFi Direct AP in your phone settings. 1 out of 3 times I had to initiate that re-connection, which I'm guessing is due to some sort of timeout happening, but I'm not sure.  ***** PREVIOUS REVIEW ***** I got a previous version of this vacuum robot for my wife's business space and was super impressed with it. It didn't really NEED me to use WiFi and the app to make it work, and wow, she knew the floors were dirty, but not THAT dirty. It's done really well for her in the couple of months she's had it.  Come Prime Day 2024, I figured I'd pick something up for the house. Our Jack Russell terrier is getting older and shedding like a monster, and I abhor dog hair, so having something that could help us keep up with that was desirable. Having been an early adopter of the Roomba back in the day, the one thing I abhorred and has kept me from a robot vacuum since going through 2 or 3 early versions was emptying the anemic dust bins on these things. The self emptying on my wife's has been awesome and I was looking at this to be even better because AI, right?  Well, yeah, not so much.  As a physical vacuum, the unit cleans pretty well. I don't have any real complaints there, and the self-emptying is nice and has worked well so far. LOTS of dog hair in that bin. More than I realized was present, actually. Gross. But it is hands-free to empty which is pretty awesome. So it does clean (perhaps) even better than I expected.  This unit leaves me utterly disappointed in the app and it's supposed AI, however. The intelligence is pretty artificial from what I can tell, and not in a good way.  Getting the system to map the house took three tries before it decided it actually did need to go into the big 20 square foot, devoid of any furniture, people or other obstructions area in my mud room. It did finally map the full space, and shows the area to be roughly 900 feet. By my calculations that's roughly right, and the map is pretty close in its shape, though there is a big blob in one of the rooms I still don't quite think aligns to reality. But it's close enough, and the vacuum will still go into the area represented by the blob, so I'm not really sure what that's about. I guess I could be misinterpreting the display, after all I don't have Artificial Intelligence, I just have my brain.  Where the app falls utterly short, though is there is no true practical use of the intelligence the system has built about the area. It has a map, but can't really use it in a meaningful way! The value of a robot vacuum isn't to make a bunch of racket while running around a specific room while I'm entertaining or trying to watch a movie. The value proposition of a vacuum robot is to automate tasks I don't want to do on my own. Like scheduling a cleaning job in a specific room at one time, and scheduling another cleaning job in another room during another time window. Being able to send the robot to a specific room ad hoc isn't in the top 5 basic requirements I would post for a system like this. Top 10, maybe? But not before actual honest-to-goodness helpful AUTOMATION.  But Shark has not deemed the utilization of the map with the schedule to be an important feature for their app. It's an FAQ as to whether you CAN do that, so it isn't like they don't KNOW people want this capability. And multi-point scheduling is something that vacuum robots have been able to do for years (iRobot's app can do this for most models now, for instance, as can other brands). Multi-point scheduling is such a simple app task at this point there are libraries available for plugging that kind of function into a mobile app. Come on, Shark, you aren't in the least bit intelligent if you can't actually use the intelligence to do something useful!!! THIS IS SHAMEFUL and speaks to a complete lack of either 1) understanding your customer use cases or 2) caring enough about your customer to do something besides put your shortcomings into an FAQ.  SO you can't schedule the vacuum to work on specific rooms it has mapped out at specific times, scheduled cleaning is an all or nothing thing. BUT, if you enable a no-go zone to try and, say, keep the dogs from being too overly disturbed during the all or nothing scheduled cleaning, that area is now apparently a black hole singularity for the vacuum and can never be gone into again as long as the circuits of the poor little creature draw power. Unless you of course go to the pain of deleting the no-go zone to get it spot cleaned, and then have to work with the app to maybe successfully recreate it.  The creation of rooms and no-go zones has been a spotty and painful action within the app. Sometimes it works, sometimes it hasn't. I've had to go so far as to reboot my phone to get the \"resizer\" of a no-go zone to resize or move around on the map and the app acknowledge and save it properly. I'm done recreating the zones and will just sweep those from now on, I'm so fed up with it. The fact that you can't override these zones for a spot clean, is again a sign of either complete development laziness or incompetence. It's a simple matter of a question -- \"you've asked to spot clean this area, would you like to override the no-go zone for this session\" and then let the little guy run wild in his heretofore restricted space. It's AI, after all, not just common human intelligence we're working with here!!  The reason that the all or nothing approach to scheduled jobs sucks so bad is that this thing is LOUD. My wife's unit is not loud like this one (I'm guessing the 'superior' AI brain of this model must be making the loud clacking sound on our home model, but I'm not sure). From the first run taking it out of the box, it has made a terribly loud clacking sound as it runs around picking up dirt. I've looked at all the troubleshooting steps and the brush isn't clogged, there's nothing stuck in it, and it is firmly in place like it should be, but it definitely seems as if the bristles or the little blue sweeper stripes are hitting the cross bar of the guard hard enough to make an obnoxious sound. I know it's brush bar related, because when the super brain was running around the house for three hours mapping things, it was actually relatively quiet -- enough so that if that's how it was when doing its job, I'd have no other problems; alas that's not the case.  SO, when you're trying to get that scheduled all or nothing cleaning done overnight, and the kids are downstairs in the basement trying to sleep, all they hear is a thwack-thwack-thwack-thwack-thwack sound as it runs around the first floor. And since it seems ~900 square feet of space is too much for the system to do on a full charge, it starts doing that thwack-thwack-thwack thing at 3am after it has returned to the dock and recharged.  I do really like the \"return to recharge\" and \"return to empty\" features, don't get me wrong they're awesome, but with all the racket and the all or nothing approach, I can't get the whole first floor vacuumed and the kids a full night's sleep. It's rather sad (first world problem, I know, I know, I should put brooms in the kids hands -- we do that too!) but for what you pay for this device (even on Prime Day) that claims to have an AI engine at play in its favor, I expect more.  And just to be clear, this isn't a house that's filthy with layers of dirt all over the floor by the time the little dude gets going. We swiffer and sweep throughout the day to clean up spot messes and we're not living on a farm or something where we're tracking in mud three inches deep a day. There's kid chaff and some dog chaff around, but this isn't a \"heavy\" mess we're dealing with on a daily basis.  While I don't love the unit, it does appear to me that proper app development and updates would resolve the problems I have (outside of the noise). I could work around the noise with more powerful intelligence brought to the scheduling, though, so I'm hopeful they'll put the work in and resolve the shortcomings. If that happens, stars could easily be added to the review.",

              "body": "Highly recommend for dog owners!!  I never write reviews but after having for 2+ months I just have to because of how good it is. I bought this specifically because I was going to look after my parents Great Pyrenees mixed dog that sheds a lot. I was nervous and skeptical but it’s been super easy and convenient to use! It does a great job running on both hard surfaces and carpet. I have it set to run everyday at the same time. I never need to think abt it. It’s fairly quiet and I empty the storage compartment abt once a week (since my dog sheds a lot). Emptying only takes abt 5 seconds. The first couple times my dog was a little nervous around it but now she doesn’t care and just goes to a room it’s not in until the robot makes its way there. This little guy is very systematic and efficient when it cleans so it doesn’t randomly bounce everywhere. Setup is very obvious and I love the little reports it spits out - it runs when I’m not home fairly often.  I just vacuumed for the first time in 2 months to get some of the areas the robot can’t reach (only 3 tight little spots). Only vacuumed for about 5 minutes.",

              "body": "I have a 5 year old Shark Ion robot, Dusty, that I loved. After all these years I’m noticing issues. I’ve replaced the battery and that helped solve a big issue with charging. But I do notice Dusty gets stuck quite a bit more than it used to, stops working randomly, or doesn’t charge when on the charger, so I have to readjust so he will charge.  I decided to try t this new Shark robot, PigPen, because I loved Dusty so much. This one is so much better! I love the lidar that keeps PigPen going around objects. It cleans quite well. I’ve had it for a couple weeks now and just emptied the bin because it looked full of fur. I have two cats and a small dog, so I run it about 4 days a week to keep the fur under control. The picture is after the week and a half ish I’ve been running it. Pigpen has picked up lots of fur and covers way more area than the roaming Dusty does. So Dusty has been moved downstairs to the kitchen and PigPen is now upstairs in the living area. When Dusty does eventually die, which I think is coming sooner than I’d like, I’ll invest in a second PigPen.",

              "body": "I recently purchased a used Shark robot vacuum that was rated as being in “very good” condition, and I have to admit, I was initially hesitant about buying a used product. However, once it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by how well-maintained it was. Despite being a pre-owned item, it arrived looking almost new, with only minor scratches from previous use. The real highlight was how clean the filters, brushes, and bins were—everything was spotless and ready to go. It’s clear that the previous owner (or the seller) took good care of it, which made me feel even more confident in my purchase.  Setting up the device was a breeze. The instructions were clear, and within no time, I had it charged and ready to map my home. Compared to older models, this one really impressed me with its near-perfect mapping accuracy. It was able to learn the layout of my house with minimal issues, and the smart navigation system has made a noticeable difference in its cleaning efficiency. It reaches all the nooks and crannies without getting stuck, and the mapping precision is definitely a major upgrade from older versions I’ve used.  When it comes to performance, I couldn’t be happier. The vacuum does a fantastic job cleaning my floors, and I especially love how it leaves those perfect vacuum lines in the carpet. There’s something so satisfying about coming home to freshly cleaned floors with neat, even strips. It does a thorough job of picking up dirt, dust, and pet hair, leaving my home looking spotless without any extra effort on my part.  The noise level is pretty reasonable as well. While it’s not whisper-quiet, it’s not overly disruptive either. That being said, I rarely run it while I’m home—I usually schedule it to clean while I’m at work. That way, I can come back to a clean house without having to hear it in action. The suction power is impressive, especially for a robot vacuum, and it handles both carpet and hard floors with ease.  Another small but enjoyable detail is how sleek and modern it looks when it’s docked. It blends into the room nicely and doesn’t look out of place sitting on its charging station. It’s a great addition to the home, both in terms of function and design.  Overall, I’m extremely happy with this purchase, and I would definitely recommend this model to anyone considering a robot vacuum. Despite being used, the condition was excellent, and the performance has far exceeded my expectations. If you’re on the fence about buying a used one, don’t hesitate—this product proves that you can get great value without sacrificing quality.",

              "body": "I had been browsing robot vacuums for some time and finally took the plunge on Prime Day. It was easy to set up out of the box, the robot vac is configured with an app on your phone. Steve McClean needed time to charge before he could map the floor plan. I bought Steve for the upstairs which is wall to wall carpet with tile in the bathrooms and laundry room, and a week later added Rosie for the downstairs, which is all hardwood with throw rugs. I followed Steve on his first mapping mission and was impressed that he figured out the stairs on his own. I couldn’t fully decipher the map of the floor plan he produced on the first go round to set up no go areas, I did that step after a few runs when I had completed job maps to compare with. Steve did a great job on all floors the first time out. I had vacuumed with my Shark upright ahead of time and I was amazed by the amount of dust, hair and lint the Steve picked up. Steve goes under beds and tables the upright couldn't get to. After a few cleaning sessions I purchased Rosie for the downstairs which is all hardwood floors with throw rugs. Rosie is scheduled to work every night, I love walking downstairs in the mornings to clean floors. Through the app I was able to set up both robots to specify rooms and no-go areas on the floor plan, and schedule cleanings. When I had an unscheduled call during a cleaning session, I was able to use the app to pause Steve until the call was over. I allowed the app to send notifications to my phone and have received notifications for low battery when the robots are accidentally bumped off their docks and a notification that Rosie was going to fall off a cliff. Turns out she was just tied up in some cords. She stayed there all night until her battery died. Cords are a challenge for the robot vacuums, it has forced me to put away any cords that are not in use and organize those that are. I’m still working on identifying and setting those areas up as no-go. I work at home during the day and have set up Steve’s cleaning times for when I don’t have calls scheduled. The vacuuming itself isn’t particularly loud but the emptying when going to the docking station is. The robots dock themselves for emptying and charging. I had to move Steve to a lower traffic area, so he wasn’t getting bumped and taken off the charger. Overall, I am thrilled to have automated the cleaning of my floors. Only wish I had ordered two on Prime Day instead of paying full price for the second one.",
