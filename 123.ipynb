I did do a good cleaning recently and, after looking at instructions on various YouTube site I found how easy it was to clean around wheels, clean single wheel in front of iRobot, to remove strings etc. I started off without researching and was struggling but after finding out how to really do the job it was a piece of cake. The iRobot designers really too all this cleaning into consideration when designing the product.  So far, maintains 5 star rating.  The following is a summary of my experience with my new iRobot I7+  I bought this vacuum to replace my Neato Connected which was very good at cleaning but left a lot as far as reliability; in less than 5 years I had to have it repaired 3 times at a cost of almost $400. This for a relatively expensive robot. When the battery failed ($70.00) and the robot started not knowing where it was I decided enough is enough.  When I got the iRobot I followed installation instructions which were pretty straight forward, updated the software (again very easy), and then waited for it to fully charge. I then sent it out to clean my whole house (about 2200 sq ft). It ran for about a hour and then went back to base to recharge. I started up after charging and ran for another 10 minutes when it stopped with error message saying problem with dust bin on robot (not dustbin in base). One of nice things is that error message is displayed in iPhone app which also has a \"Learn more\" button which brings you to a little tutorial on how to resolve the problem. Followed instructions and cleaned the dust bin in the robot. Kind of a nice feature. Turned it back on and 5 minutes later same message. Did this several times and was about to just send it back but decided to give YouTube a try. Entered message text and got to video showing same stuff as Learn More but also said to take out the two brushes and clear anything there. Sure enough, there was a paper clip there which was stopping the brushes. Cleared the paper clip and it\\'s been fine. Fault was with Learn More. With what appears to be a very user friendly function, I expected that anything there would tell me about ALL sources and resolutions regarding the problem so this was just an incomplete implementation of the facility.  Sent the iRobot to to clean my whole house a 3-4 times and it was still not able to put together a full view of the house so that I could use the map to tell it t clean just one area. After looking around a while a found an option in the iPhone app that says \"Just go out an map the house without doing any actual cleaning\" which allows the whole house to be mapped on one charge. Once that was completed I was able to see my house map and label rooms, adjust walls, etc. Once I had my house mapped I was able to: 1) name rooms 2) adjust walls between open rooms 3) create \"cleaning areas\" consisting of one or more rooms. Really a nice feature worth the upgrade from I3 to I7.  Just sent the robot out to clean just my bedroom and it started fine, went directly to bedroom, cleaned whole room, and then returned to base and emptied it\\'s dust bin -- just as expected.  Oher things to watch out for: 1) Robot picked up small piece of paper (1.5\"x2\") and sucked it into it\\'s bin. But when it went to base to be emptied the paper blocked the opening in robot which allows debris to be drawn into base. Robot threw another message and I was able to see the problem. Removed paper and all OK. 2) Regarding self-emptying...works good but VERY VERY load for 15-30 seconds while debris from robot into base is being processed. Would not recommend running this during the night; the noise will surely wake you up. 3) Dust bin in robot is very small compared to my previous Neato vacuum. If you do not get the I7+ with self-emptying base, depending on size of your house, you may have to empty bin multiple times. Of course, my Neato died a couple months ago so there was some accumulated dust and debris picked up in this first cleaning.  That\\'s it for day one and two. Once past the \"problems\" the I7+ does a good job cleaning, is pretty quiet while running, and has some nice features in the iPhone app. Assuming I run into no further problems I\\'d recommend get the i7+ (no s much the I7 due to size of dust bin).  Day 2-7; no problems and my house is staying a lot cleaner than depending on me to sweep and dust.  Couple months later ... Had some problems with robot that were addressed via conversations with support team over three days -- who very very nice. After factory reset and full mapping run problems went away. One suggestion ... I was having t he robot clean the while house (2200 sq ft) in one pass which required a few stops for recharging. The result was that it sometimes did not make it back to charger or forgot where it left off. My solution was to have it clean 1/4 of the house each day for 4 days. Since doing that I\\'ve had no problems.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 265, 'reviewer': {'name': 'pfk93'}}, {'title': 'The best of the best!', 'body': 'This review will cover the i7 as well as another top contender I tried, the Deebot N8+. If you just want to read about the i7 please skip to that part.  If you\\'ve done your homework, watched Vacuum Wars videos on YouTube and compared all available options right now, you may have landed on these 2 as your top contenders. The S9 looks nice but it\\'s way too expensive and the reviews just aren\\'t good enough. Roborock looks promising but their top end model is relatively expensive and doesn\\'t have an auto-empty bin as of the date of this review. There is no \"perfect\" robot in existence right now, in my view. I\\'m a 5 year owner of a Roomba 960 that had to be returned 3 times initially and repaired once out of warranty before it reached a stable state for me. I figured it was time for an upgrade. I was not optimistic about the i7 at all due to previous 960 issues and for that reason purchased the Deebot first as an extremely impressive option full of advanced tech. I\\'ll give you my experience with both and why, much to my surprise, I landed on the i7 as the robot I will keep.  First up, the N8 Pro+ which boasts variable suction levels that auto-switch depending on the floor type, low noise levels, laser 3D LiDAR tech for navigation, object avoidance camera, dual rotating brushes, built in mopping capability and a physically thinner footprint so it can get under my kitchen cabinets where my 960 gets stuck, daily. The functionality of the Ecovacs app is all there but my gripes are mainly around the layout, button naming and settings menus. I didn\\'t find it very intuitive at all but all the key features are there: house mapping and virtual keep out zones being my top priorities. I did have some trouble with the initial configuration of the keep-out zones but got there eventually. The robot functions very well in general and is a very good vacuum, all told. The downsides that I experienced, however, were enough for me to return it. The key cons here are battery life, recharge time, the auto-empty base and getting stuck. Your first step with the N8 is the initial mapping of your floorplan which must be completed fully before you can do anything, I mean anything. It runs the vacuum during this mapping so battery consumption will be high. The i7 by comparison can do mapping runs with the vacuum turned off making it a much more streamlined process. I found the battery life to be much lower than the advertised 110 minutes netting a maximum of 75 minutes. The bigger problem is that it takes HOURS to recharge, so depending on when you start your cleaning run, this thing could quite literally run all day. For example in my situation, 635 square feet cleaned took 110 minutes of total run time with a required charge in the middle. This netted a total of nearly 6 hours to complete! Unacceptable. Also important to note is that the N8 will want to recharge at 15% battery, so the most you ever really get out of this thing is 85%. The next big problem for me was the design of the auto-empty base. They opted to use a dual port discharge method that sucks from 2 doors in the dust bin simultaneously. If you have pet hair to deal with, like I do, it was unable to suck out any of it, just leaving stranded clumps hanging from each port in the dust bin. The final nail in the coffin was that despite all the advanced tech in the N8, cameras, lasers, etc, it STILL got stuck under the dining room table/ chairs just like my 960 does. Too many concessions so I sent it back and tried my luck with the i7+.  N8 Pros: -Competitive price (usually on sale) -Premium look and feel -Advanced tech (cameras, lasers...) -Powerful variable suction -Systematic cleaning pattern -Free in-box extras (bags, mop pads) -Awesome low noise levels -Lower physical profile so glides under kitchen cabinets  N8 Cons: -Initial mapping will take a VERY long time and must be fully completed -Even with Lidar, mapping, sensing etc it still gets stuck -Battery life is terrible (more like 75 minutes at best) vs 110, charging time is worse (1 cleaning + charge cycle = 5 hours!) -85% max usable battery is abysmal, Roomba will drain itself to nothing -Dual port self-empty in the base creates problems, especially for pet hair  With the N8 returned I found the i7 on sale for the same price and pulled the trigger to give iRobot yet another chance. Much less advanced overall tech here, the same \"crash into everything\" sensor mode as the old Roomba models, no fancy lasers here but the camera does use iAdapt to map out objects. This camera needs light, mind you. Out of the box is a very simple setup just plug in the base, set the robot in it, add the robot to the app. I was prompted with a firmware update right away so let that run and waited until the next day to do the initial mapping run. Being able to just wander around without the vacuum running is such a simple but meaningful feature here. One battery charge and you should have a map of your floorplan, vs 2 runs + 1 charge on my N8. The completed map was excellent and they even attempt to add room dividers so you can partition areas of your house for more granularity. This is really cool and allows you to choose certain areas to clean on certain days or times if you want. No-go zones and room labels are also easily applied here. VERY intuitive app layout, button naming scheme, settings menus. You can tell iRobot put a lot of effort into this. So I did the mapping run then followed with a \"vacuum everywhere\" run, no virtual barriers yet. Not only was the robot able to navigate my entire floor cleaning everything, it didn\\'t get stuck once, even under the kitchen cabinets or dining room chairs, truly impressive. It did need a charge in the middle but at an hour or so to top up, the cleaning process completes in a much more reasonable time period. The rubber brush rolls are great for hair of all kinds and manage to pass it to the dust bin without tangles. i7 triggers the auto-empty base which is LOUD like a jet taking off but wow is it effective, nothing left in the dust bin after, not a strand of long cat hair. iRobot used a single port suction method for the base which works much better than the dual port design the N8 uses, so no problem with stuck pet hair. For comparison, the i7 cleaned 658 sq ft in 133 mins of cleaning plus a 75 minute charge. Half the total time of the N8. Cool!  As for the downsides, there are a few but minor considering the system actually works well. First is the bump sensor design. I know the i7 first came out 3 years ago and once the robot learns your house it should be more gentle, as they claim, but this just feels like ancient tech at this point. Not only that, the RCON sensor, which is the protruding eye in the middle above the bumper, takes plenty of direct hits as it activates the bumper it sits on. This is the part I needed repaired on my 960 as one day it actually broke off due to years of repeated impact. iRobot should do like the others in this space and move it somewhere else safer! The unit itself is thicker than the N8 so doesn\\'t glide under my cabinets but so far has managed to avoid getting stuck. The single rotating brush isn\\'t as effective as the dual brushes on the N8 and you would need to buy a separate mopping robot, if you care about that. The other thing to keep in mind is that the Roomba can\\'t see well in the dark, it needs light to do its thing.  Overall I\\'m very pleased with the i7 and intend to keep it. All the areas the N8 falls short work as intended or better on the i7, despite being lower tech. And this is after I was almost positive I wouldn\\'t buy another Roomba!  i7 Pros: -Competitive price -Premium look and feel -Systematic cleaning pattern -Free in-box extras (1 bag, filter, rotating brush) -Excellent battery and charging performance -Excellent auto-empty base -ZERO issue with long pet hair -Intuitive and granular control via the app (clean zones, no go zones, defined rooms that can be scheduled) -Smart Maps works really well  i7 Cons: -Old school vSLAM bump sensor tech that will mar the more stuff it bumps into -RCON sensor sits in harms way atop the bumper -Single rotating brush could be improved -Room lighting is required, this thing doesn\\'t do well in the dark -No variable speed motor = higher noise, about the same as my 960', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 177, 'reviewer': {'name': 'The Exacting Consumer'}}, {'title': 'You ARE getting what you pay for.  Very well developed product.', 'body': \"I researched robot vacuums a few years ago and determined they weren't far enough along in development for our needs. I didn't want to spend more time helping the robot correct errors, than we would have spent just vacuuming. The last couple years we knew they were getting closer to a fully developed product. We needed mapping, wifi phone control software updates/notifications/scheduling/good with pet hair (we have two dogs and one is a lab mix that sheds heavy AND light floating hairs)/ability to work itself out of situations and decent suction. The self-emptying was a Bonus. I didn't have to have that until I 'knew what I didn't know.' We finally decided to take the chance. We are really satisfied with the purchase (of 'Rosie').  We read some reviews prior to purchase on many units. We would hear that the i7 is good with pet hair on some reviews and on others that it was not so good. We 'read between the lines' and determined that it was good (prior to purchase). The bad reviews would say that it clumps the hair and pushes it around. This is believable, but we figure those that say it is not good, were using it in areas with build-up that don't get vacuumed very often. We never expected the i7 to be a 'Make-ready' robot for a rental house (just joking, but you get the point). These are maintenance robots not detailers (it does go back and forth on areas that it senses more dust). When we received the unit, we were waiting to see clumps of dog hair. We didn't see any at 1st (was hidden). Then we saw a couple spots under the bed, in one of the bedrooms where we had some clumping. Our thoughts were verified; it was an area that didn't get vacuumed often. We were ok with picking up a few clumps to get the area into a state where it could be cleaned, on a regular basis. Basically, you don't send the robot into an episode of 'Hoarders' and expect it to clear out the clutter. I figure iRobot has lost some sales due to not communicating this situation better to potential purchasers. This can be misunderstood by review readers. If I were CEO, I would get with Marketing and get this communication corrected tomorrow.  It has been stuck/stopped a few times, but we have learned what not to leave on the floor or what to correct; phone charger ends and sagging middle of bottom of console tables. It does a GREAT job of twisting out of standard 110v cords and corners of area rugs. It also bumped a bedroom door closed one day and locked itself in the bedroom. I received a notification on my phone and opened the door. We keep the minor clutter picked up a little better now that Rosie is running around...a plus to us.  I can schedule/send it to go clean a specific room or rooms. at anytime. Very nice. It's not too loud either (I don't have a robot to compare it to, but I can watch TV and am not bothered at all...except for putting my feet up on the coffee table).  It will take 5 or so cleans to map out your house before you can use that feature (it will tell you the % mapped after each clean until it's fully mapped); FYI - It will bounce around to different rooms without fully cleaning a room and then go back to a previous room. I don't have a copy of the algorithm, but I suspect it finds and reverifies some landmarks.  FYI - Also, if you are moving furniture around in a room while it's cleaning, it's probably not going to clean everything (under that item) IF it has already bumped/recorded the location of said item. Best to let it clean once in that room (assuming mapping is already set up) and then move the furniture around on a 2nd pass. Also, don't move a bunch of furniture around during the mapping while the robot is in that room as it can affect the mapping....wait until the mapping process (5+ cleans) is completed. Then you move stuff all around.  The battery life is good. The visual design is exceptional. The suction is good. I think there is one with more suction, but we don't need that, even with our 2 dogs and 2 kids. The notifications that I receive on my phone tell me what 'Rosies' doing (cleaning, charging, self-emptying, stuck, when she will resume cleaning while charging OR when she is finished, etc.).  It's not perfect, but it is a very well developed product (also, it gets wifi updates as they come out, as the company improves it algorithms). You ARE getting what you pay for.

Replacement worked.\", 'body': 'My complaints (and initial 1 star rating) center around the generation and use of the map with the I7+. I have a large house; I was trying to use on one floor of ~3000SF. The first problem is that it could not complete a cleaning cycle during waking hours. I had to cancel the job to keep it from running at night and that prevented any mapping information from being saved. It is unfortunate that iRobot doesn\\'t allow overnight or other long pauses (90 minutes max). I then started just doing mapping without cleaning. It took three five hour sessions to complete a map; I was thrilled when it finished. I edited doorways, named the rooms and added a few clean zones and keep out zones. Then I tried to use it. I gave it a simple job of cleaning two designated clean zones - one was about 10 sf and the other was maybe 50 sf. It did about half of the first one but couldn\\'t find the second one or find its way back to the base. I retried this test with variations numerous times. I had sent several emails to tech support along the way but it has only been less than a week so I didn\\'t get a response. I\\'m not sure they got through since the website kept saying: \"Warning There was an error with the request and the action could not be completed.\" Then today I called in to tech support and was connected in a few minutes. Unfortunately the only solution suggested was to delete and redo the map. I\\'m not interested in doing that - too time consuming with no guarantee of success. We did a soft reboot and a battery removal reboot but that didn\\'t solve the problem. I called back to get a second opinion and was told that my house was probably too large and I needed a second base so it wouldn\\'t die before it got back to the main base. It has never died trying to get back so that didn\\'t seem like a solution I wanted to pursue (at additional cost). It had been trying several times to go through a wall so they wanted a picture of the area it was getting stuck in while trying to return home. They said they would email me a link for submitting the photo. I haven\\'t gotten the link yet. The first rep I talked to told me I should move the base to a new location but that would require generating a new map. The second rep said that the bot would find the new base without having to make a new map; this rep was correct. I did move the base. It did not help with the problem but the bot did find the new location and the system did update the location on the map. I tried deleting the keep out zones but that didn\\'t help either. I think I\\'ve invested enough time in this and it\\'s time to return the system. I was satisfied with the cleaning but the mapping took too long. There was considerable repetition in 80+% of the house before it finally stumbled onto the few outermost corners that had been missing from the map. Maybe I\\'ll give them another try in a few years. 12/11/2020 Update My rating hasn\\'t changed yet but here is more information. I still have time on the return so I decided to delete the original map and start over. In a 6 hour period it created a partial map but it again includes errors. It still has a nonexistent pathway through a wall, has added a 30 ft path extending away from and outside the house and shows the base in the wrong room. I started a Clean Everywhere job this morning. I expect that to take all day. After the first segment (battery depleted) it has at least returned the base to the correct location. I still haven\\'t gotten a response from my emails to customer support that started on 12/5/2020. I\\'ve had to add some physical barriers in front of several pieces of furniture and a treadmill to keep the roomba from getting underneath because it gets stuck about half of the time (those old college text books finally came in handy for something. I\\'ve also used a baseball bat and the old extension tubes for my central vac that I\\'m hoping I won\\'t need again.). Another observation is that it struggles on rugs with fringe; this is not a new issue but excludes some areas for me. I have beds with adjustable bases which means cords and transformers on the floor. It was spending so much time dithering around under the bed that I decided to physically exclude that area by attaching a slim rope two inches above the floor running around the outermost legs. That has worked well but leaves a home for dust bunnies. Update 12/12/2020 I\\'ve increased my rating to 3 stars after a third call to customer support. On my third call, I spoke with a very helpful gentlemen. Although initially unable to find my account, he arranged to call me back later in the day to provide a solution. He requested that I send some screenshots of maps from my roomba for him to look at since he couldn\\'t access them at the time. When he called back later he said he had been able to access my account and that based on the behavior seen in the maps and the problems I described in the emails, I needed to have my robot replaced. I submitted proof of purchase and he authorized a replacement to be sent UPS second day air. I should have it by 12/16/2020. Unfortunately, the map will have to be generated again (third time) but he assures me it will be a much smoother process this time. If so, I expect to give it 4 stars. It\\'s not getting 5 stars until I can more easily generate a map and they can allow indefinite (or at least 24 hour) job delays so I can suspend cleaning overnight and have it pick up where it left off the next. So far cleaning has been adequate but could be better; I assume the \"better\" would come from the S9 with its greater suction. Update 12/22/2020 The replacement arrived on time. The next day I started mapping runs. It took 3 five hour mapping sessions (including charging time) to generate a complete map so I don\\'t consider the mapping to have been any smoother than the first two but at least this one appears to be accurate. I\\'ve started a couple of small cleaning jobs and the roomba seems to be performing as requested with one minor annoyance. The replacement was NOT configured for a clean base so the dust bin did not have a cleaning port. After the first cleaning job the app kept reporting a clog. After a couple of retries I realized it was the dust bin. Luckily I hadn\\'t sent the old one back yet so I was able to swap the bins and get it working again. iRobot email support is still deciding not to answer any of my questions simply because they have sent a replacement I7 and they apparently think that will resolve all of the issues. However, my emails included other issues. At this point I\\'m about 0 for 3 on email support and 1 for 3 on telephone support. I\\'m upping my rating to 4 stars but that\\'s it. I think the mapping process has too much repetition and could be optimized to complete faster. Cleaning is pretty good on tile but only adequate on thick pile carpet. The Clean Zone capability seems to work; haven\\'t exercised the Keep Out Zone option yet.', 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': 59, 'reviewer': {'name': 'RGibbsRetired'}}, {'title': 'Update 2 years later: Worst robot ever', 'body': 'I truly hate to vacuum. Always have. So I was one of the first to buy a Roomba when the original model came out. It was a disaster. I spent more time preparing the house (picking up kids toys, dog toys, all electrical cords, and carefully tucking under the fringes on the ends of the oriental rugs) every time I ran it than it took to just do the vacuuming myself. After a couple months of that nonsense, I threw the #@&$ thing away. Fast forward several years. I still hate to vacuum. (And my kids are grown up and I no longer have rugs with fringe.) So I tried one of the newer Roombas that can be scheduled to run without me thinking about it. With 7 seriously-shedding pets, I set it to run every night. And I have to admit that the house stayed much cleaner than it was with me vacuuming only once a week. But it also meant I had to empty the vacuum’s dust bin daily. Not a huge deal, but yet one more thing to get done every morning before I could get out the door. When I saw that iRobot came out with a Roomba that empties its own dust bin, I was excited and started looking for excuses to buy a new one even though my current machine was working just fine. Fortunately, I am truly gifted at justifying unnecessary purchases and I told myself I really need a robotic vacuum for each floor of the house. Thus, I became the happy owner of a self-emptying Roomba. (Her name is Louise.) She still runs every night. And she is somewhat loud when she empties her dust bin, but with my bedroom door closed, it does not wake me up. It has been a week, and I have not emptied the vacuum trash yet. She notifies me when she has finished (and once when she got stuck) and she supposedly will notify me when I need to replace the bag in the dust-collection bin. Louise works with Alexa. She has mapped my upstairs, so when I just now told my Alexa to have Louise vacuum the kitchen, she ran right off to comply. I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship.  Beginning of update: My beautiful relationship lasted another week or so before Louise started having problems. Now, two years into our relationship, I want a divorce. She is definitely more trouble than doing the vacuuming myself. And my house is not as clean as it was when I vacummed once a week. There may be one or two days a month when she does NOT text me with some problem: * Louise successfully completed a job, but could not go everywhere you wanted. (And there is no indication, from the valume of pet hair on the floor, that she ran ANYwhere.) * Louise is stuck. (Most of the time I get this message, she is sitting in the middle of the carpet.) * Louise’s battery is low. Please place on the charging station. (I thought she was supposed to recharge herself, then resume the job.) * Louise’s dust bin is full. Please empty the bin and clean the sensors. (I get this one a LOT. The entire reason I spent $1000 for this piece of junk was so I WOULDN’T have to empty it.) * There is a communication problem with the base. (This seems to be her catchall excuse for not doing what was asked of her.) Her latest issue is that the spinning brush will not stay screwed in tightly, so it stops spinning after a few minutes. Which means the wads of pet hair that accumulate along the walls just keep growing. Tonight, after trying for the umpteenth time to “service” one of her issues, I placed her directly in front of her base and pushed the button to send her home. She obediently returned to her base, sang her “successful completion” tune, sat there for 2 minutes, then took off again without being told to. We repeated the “send her home only to have her take off again” cycle 4 more times before she gave up.  I do download every update, each time hoping it will resolve problems. But they only seem to introduce additional errors. I’m starting to suspect that the only reason for updates is that iRobot has found a new way to capture and store my data. To be fair, this was a fairly new model when I bought it. Hence the much higher price than is now being charged for the same robot. Even at it’s reduced price, I would not buy this Roomba again. iRobot should be ashamed.', 'rating': 1, 'helpfulVotes': 38, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Sue W.'}}, {'title': 'Awesome Roomba for Pet Owners', 'body': 'This Roomba is well worth the money. We have used a Roomba off and on for over ten years. Before the i7 series I can admit I pretty much liked it for the novelty of the product more than the functionality of it. When I was a bachelor in a small apartment, its haphazard bouncing around was more than adequate. When we had a bigger condo and toddlers running around the older roomba\\'s were ineffective. Now that we have two kids almost pre-teen and two huskies - we needed some more help. In comes the i7.  We recently put in dark wood floors and while we love the look - everything shows. A crumb can be viewed from across the house and our huskies are white and black so any dropped hair is easily visible. We do sweep and mop regularly to collect the bulk of the stuff in the usual places (such as crumbs in the kitchen or dining room) but there is nothing quite like waking up to a clean floor. We got the i7 because of the mapping features, but it is so much more.  Pros: - Mapping - We will start with why we bought this. The i7 Roomba does not simply bounce around like those before it. This roomba has a sensor that will detect if its about to collide with an object and then slows down to slightly bump the object and begins to map where the object is in a room. After two runs (for us) the Roomba had fully mapped the first floor (about 1000sq ft). Once mapped we can place room dividers, name the rooms, and even mark out \"no go\" zones to keep it away from either the dog\\'s water bowl or some cables we don\\'t want it to go near. This feature works exceptionally well. - The sensor - as mentioned above we have kids and dogs. This means that no matter how much we pick up the floor, one of the creatures in this house is going to come behind us and put any number of things out in the middle of the floor where it doesn\\'t belong. The i7 Roomba can identify when it is approaching an object and will slow down to give it a gentle nudge. More often than not in our house its a sleeping husky. One of them politely moves for the Roomba to do its job. The other one simply lays there stubbornly and we end up with a husky sized outline of clean/not clean. It is actually as humorous as it sounds. - The cleaning \"bristles\" - I was pretty sure that having wood floors would mean we could never have a Roomba again. We actually waited more than a year before we even tried looking. The newer generation has a rubber roller it uses to move dirt to the middle of its path and then collect as it goes over. This system is great and ensures the floor doesn\\'t get damaged. - The cleaning base - If you are looking at this i7+ it should come with a cleaning station. This is essentially the power dock with a dust bag in it for collection. Having Huskies, this thing is a must. If for some reason we are lazy and don\\'t do a quick sweep before sending the Roomba on its way or if there was an area the kids inevitably \"forgot\" to do as part of their chores - the roomba will detect that it is full, return to its base, drop off its bin, and return to the place that it left off. If the battery is low, it will take a break, send your app a push message that it needs to juice up for a minute and will resume when its ready.  Cons: - Noise - To be fair - its a vacuum. I am not really sure what some people expect here. I typically turn it on while I am doing the dishes or when we go to bed. It doesn\\'t keep us up, but it would probably be a bit annoying to watch a tv show in the same room as it. - Can get stuck - Its a robot and it does what it can. It is 1000% better than previous versions but we do have a rocking chair that it occasionally catches itself on. By occasionally I mean maybe 3-4 times since we bought it and we have used it nightly. - Clean Base Noise - This is more of a warning than a con, so just be aware. When the Roomba is emptying the dust bin you have one vacuum cleaning another vacuum. There is a very loud suction noise for about 15 seconds and then its done. Imagine like a car wash vacuum starting up and that is the noise. Unavoidable and not a defect by any means but surprising if you aren\\'t expecting it.  The last part is the i7 over the newer s9 series. When we purchased the i7 the s9 had already been out for some time. I had set out to get the latest and greatest, but the product reviews pretty much everywhere for the s9 were spotty. Everything from them getting stuck/lost, to not holding a battery, to needing taken apart during customer service calls. Those items might be fixed by now (Sept 2020), they can do firmware updates to the machines. We picked the i7 because we knew it would work straight out of the box and it was cheaper due to the release of the s9. There were also no real compelling features to the s9 upgrade over the i7 aside from the fact it can get into a 90 degree angle with ease, but so can the i7 using its side brush. At the end of the day - I recommend the i7 over the s9, but that could change down the road.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 156, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Patrick and Taryn'}}, {'title': 'Worth the cost!', 'body': 'I read many, many reviews before I invested in this item, as it was a lot of money to spend, and sometimes a couple of bad reviews make you not want to purchase something. I finally decided to take a chance and purchase the vacuum, and I am glad I did. I’ve had it for a week now, and it has mapped all of the areas in my house I want it to clean. We have 4 children, and I can never count on their rooms being picked up enough to send this in there. To get around it mapping those areas, every time I had it run and it was mapping the house I closed the doors. It doesn’t even register those rooms on the map now. I have this running on tile, hardwoods, and a large plush area rug with fringe. It transitions great on all surfaces. I was most worried about the fringe, but so far it hasn’t been an issue. It just passes over it and moves on. It’s not left perfect, but it was never perfect anyway with 6 people walking around the house. I would say suction power is good. We have had a few clogs, but it was our fault. I would tell my kids to make sure everything was picked up, and not double check. It’s been clogged with a hair clip, a toothpick, a receipt size piece of paper, and a piece of plastic. Had those things not been on the floor, it would not have clogged. It was very easy to unclog it. I just pulled the items out and then sent it back home to empty again. This machine seems to be pretty intelligent. Although I have the house mapped out, I have an 11 year old German Shepherd who can’t be bothered with anything. She will be laying on the floor and the vacuum will run into her. She just looks at it and won’t move. The vacuum doesn’t keep trying. It simply goes around her. I love the mapping feature and it’s ease of use. It mapped my laundry room and dining room as one area. My dining area is always picked up, my laundry room is not. It was very simple to add a divider on the map to make that one area, two areas, and I can tell it to stay out of the laundry room when I know there’s a mountain of laundry on the floor. The battery life could be longer. Considering I have a one story house and it’s not cleaning any bedrooms, it takes 2 charges to do the areas I want it to focus on. Probably around 1800 sq ft. It mostly goes in straight lines, but occasionally will go over an area a couple of times before moving on to the next. It may be how its mapped the area bc I have noticed it usually only does that in areas where the dividers are on the app. I have zero regrets purchasing this item. I am extremely happy with it. It is helping me tremendously keeping the house picked up. We have 3 cats and 1 dog who constantly sheds. My biggest concern with these robot vacuums was vacuuming my living room and then it needing me to empty it before it would continue. The self emptying option is completely worth the extra cost. It knows when it’s full, goes back to the base to empty itself and then goes right back to where it left off. It did get stuck once or twice while mapping, but after it figured out the areas it couldn’t go, it now flawlessly moves around them and hasn’t been stuck on anything since. If you’re a light sleeper I wouldn’t recommend running it at night. When it empties it sounds like a mini jet engine starting up. Probably no louder than your average vacuum, but that is something to consider if you plan on only running it overnight. I hope we don’t experience any issues, but if we do, I did purchase the 3 year extended warranty on Amazon. It was by far the best deal when I compared other retailer’s warranties, so for the next 4 years I have zero worries if it does breakdown. I this review helps anyone on the fence.

See, I\\'m a fan of Neato brand and the only reason I bought the Roomba was for the self emptying feature. So when I say I\\'m impressed, that\\'s saying a lot!  I\\'ve had this Roomba up and running for almost a month now. Setting up the machine was very easy and quick. Just follow the instructions.  It took 2 times going around my house to build a map. I think maybe 2.5 hours total. The map was created and I was able to use it to name the rooms it thought it found. You can customize the possible rooms the machine suggests by moving the lines it creates on your phone. You can also name the rooms so you can tell it which room you want it to vacuum at any given point. Very user friendly and intuitive.  The first time around the house I thought it was just going on a fast tour to get the lay of the land. I was surprised to see dirt from the floor disappearing as it passed over them. This machine is very quiet compared to my old robot vacuum. And FAST! I couldn\\'t believe how fast it was moving and picking up dirt. The dogs were surprised too because they don\\'t like the robot vacuums. (One thinks it\\'s trying to steal his toys. The other just wants nothing to do with it.) As the vacuum was zipping around the room, both dogs (66 lb and 90 lb dogs mind you) said, Aight. Ima head outside.  Ok, I thought, here\\'s where I\\'m going to hate it. There\\'s no way this can be vacuuming as well as the other brand did going this fast and this quiet. I have to admit, though, the floors look great. I have the 2 big dogs I\\'ve mentioned and one is the king of shed and i have to have the vacuum run every day to keep up with the shedding. My sister even commented on how good the carpets looked. So I lost every reason I had to hate this vacuum.  The app on the phone is extremely easy to use. I now have 2 cleaning schedules. One that vacuums the whole house 3 times a week and one that vacuums just the living room every other day. Easy to set up once the map is complete. I like that it tells you how many square feet of floor it\\'s cleaned each time and an overall cumulative total as well. You can look at the map where it cleaned for that day and it shows where it discovered \"dirt events.\" I assume these are areas it detected more dirt than normal. Apparently, when it finds one of these areas, it comes back and runs over them a second and sometimes a third time as well. Those areas are marked on the map of what was cleaned with darker colored squares. And I\\'m fairly certain they\\'re correct because they are always places in the room where the dogs play and lay around.  Some other areas of interest. It handles going from regular carpet to tile floor with no problems. It seems to handle when one of the dog\\'s toys don\\'t get picked up much better than other vacuums I\\'ve had. It has only gotten stuck one time. That was when one of the dog\\'s rope toys got a frayed end caught. But I was there when it happened and able to quickly fix the situation. When it empties it\\'s bin, I will say the first couple of times will startle you. Sounds like a jet engine revving! I though an appliance had decided to explode the first time I heard it. My sister bought the I6 as well and said it told her to empty her bag at the base once. But she said it didn\\'t feel like it was full and she kind of shook the dirt down and it\\'s continuing now. One con, because it moves so fast, when it bumps into your cold bare feet as you\\'re sitting there it can be startling and a bit painful. lol  Overall, I would definitely recommend this robot vacuum.

I didn\\'t like the provided documentation and online customer service. The \"Getting Started\" instruction card was unclear and just plain wrong. It talked about a \"drip tray\" that slides under the \"Home Base under the clip at the center of the drip tray\". The Home Base is a one-piece unit, nothing is identified as a \"drip tray\", and there is no clip. A URL is provided for \"further assistance\" but if you go there, you get the following messages: \"Oops! This page was collecting dust.\" and \"Visit Customer Care Site\". If you click on Visit Customer Care Site and search on \"i3+\" there is a link to \"iRobot Owner’s Guide and Quick Start Cards\" clicking on this link takes you to a site that offers NOTHING for an i3+ unit. Another recommendation on the Getting Started card is to download the iRobot Home app. A QR code is provided, and it worked. I installed the app on my Android phone but found that it conflicted with another app on my phone and was only moderately helpful. I clicked on the \"Vacuum Everywhere\" button and the Roomba immediately went to work. After about 40 minutes it returned to the Home Base and refused to operate. After some time, I figured out that the dust bin was full, but could not figure how to use the self-emptying feature. Within the app was a link for an owner manual but this manual is not for the i3+ specifically (maybe just the i3, not sure). Features that are on the i3+ are not covered in the manual. Specifically, the self-emptying feature and the wet mop feature are not covered. I went to the iRobot website and clicked on the chat button. The chat is a one-way-only video chat, I could see the representative, but he could not see me. He kept insisting that there was an empty bin button in the app but no such button was showing, and I could not show my phone to him in the one-way video chat. Eventually he just gave up and gave me a phone number to call. I figured out how to manually empty the dust bin and after replacing the bin in the i3+ the app empty bin button suddenly appeared (suspect the bin wasn\\'t properly seated initially). The app conflict on my phone was between the iRobot Home app and a step counter app. Every time I started the iRobot app the step counter app would shut down. This was really annoying so I searched for an app I could load on my Windows PC (this would be my preferred way to control and monitor the i3+). No such app exists. Android and iOS are the only platforms supported. I have an Amazon Fire tablet (an android device) but Fire OS is a proprietary version of Android and iRobot claims Fire OS will not work. Some Googling turned up a way to make it work. I was able to load the iRobot Home app on my Fire tablet and uninstall it from my phone. I feel like all of these frustrations could easily have been avoided if good documentation were available, if a PC app were available, if the Android app easily installed on Fire OS, if the customer service rep was better schooled in potential problems, and if the video chat was a two-way video call. These are all issues that other companies seem to handle with ease. Eventually I got the issues resolved, despite the customer no-service support, and I must say that I am impressed with the unit and it\\'s capabilities. It does a good job of vacuuming (I haven\\'t tried the mop feature yet), mapping the house floor, returning to base to self-empty, returning to base to recharge, and restarting itself after a return-to-base event.

I will say it’s really nice to have clean floors under my feet and not have to do anything to get them but press a button.  What I like: * Mop and vacuum combo - can vacuum and mop at the same time * Being able to schedule jobs * Save rooms and tell it to do only certain rooms * Self-emptying for the vacuum-only component * Watching it do its thing is mesmerizing. * I don’t have to vacuum and mop * Pretty good with edges * Navigates from hard floor to rug/carpet well * Good around obstacles.  What I would improve (or why you should get the best deal possible): * It’s loud * It’s not terribly efficient — it goes over the same spaces repeatedly before it sometimes gets to the one spot that really needs attention * Takes longer than it should due to inefficiency * You have to swap out components to use the mop part * The vacuum is really just a floor sweeper * The mop is just a light damp cloth on the bottom — not gonna get a deep clean but it’s fine for routine maintenance. In other words - better than nothing and that’s what my floors were getting before. Nothing. * Can only save one smart map. * I have to set up obstacles if I don’t want it to mop on rugs. * Instructions were terrible. I had to google several times to figure out how to get it to mop. Once you figure it out it’s fine, but it wasn’t even clear in the instructions what kind of cleaner to use. For this much money I expected way better.  I am glad I bought one.

In my opinion, this is the BEST budget vacuum at the price point. I purchased one on sale for $139. It was super easy to get started and watch it go with AMAZING results in the dustbin! Okay, so it was purchased to use at my parents\\' house, but I HAD to test it, right? :) Now, it worked so well, I immediately ordered 2 more (taking advantage of the $ale) and have 2 at my parents\\' house and one at my own. I use the schedule feature in the app to run mine every day at 9am. It starts up perfectly. With a Basset hound, it does an amazing job of keeping the house livable in between my own vacuum/mop jobs. I\\'m a firm believer in doing a deep clean with a larger vacuum, but with this running in between, my house is HUGELY improved. To top it off, running it at my parents\\' house couldn\\'t be easier with the app. I can start and stop them on MY app, and all they have to do is empty the dust bins. I\\'ve been running them for a little over a month now, and am very happy with the results.  PROS: -Runs much longer than predicted, even on standard power. -Easy to empty dustbin. -It has an Air filter (and despite others saying you have to remove screws to get to it, you don\\'t. The outer mesh is fixed in place with a screw, but the filter cartridge slips out the side). -You can \"Set it and forget it\" for the most part if you use scheduling. -Compared to a standard vacuum, this baby is VERY quiet. That isn\\'t to say it doesn\\'t make any noise (seriously, it has suction and airflow... it\\'s GONNA make noise). -If you put it in ECO mode, it is even quieter, but regardless of the mode, my basset doesn\\'t run from it. :)  CONS: All 3 of the models have a \\'different\\' sound when running. Seriously, they each sound completely different and have different noise levels, which makes me wonder. Next, she -her name is Suzie- completely ignores the boundary strips I purchased to use. (And no, I did NOT place it under anything. I even tested by laying it face up straight across the edge of the carpet... on top. NOPE, she rolls right over it -_- ... and the 2nd one I cut to fit the base of a pole lamp that she kept getting stuck half on/off of. Since it was metal, the strip just magnetically attached to the round base side... NOPE, she still bangs into it. Although she hasn\\'t hopped up onto it anymore so... you be the judge)  TIPS: 1st-If you get it on sale, go ahead and add the warranty coverage. I did. In my opinion, a CYA is always a good thing. It gives me piece of mind that if one of them turns out to be a lemon (all things have them, even vehicles) I\\'m covered. The most I\\'d have to pay is shipping and that is NOTHING compared to purchasing a new one. Besides, as I said above, they each have a unique motor sound, and I feel better knowing that if there is anything that would take away from the motor life involved, I\\'ll get a repair or a replacement. 2nd-take the time to look at the undercarriage and inspect the roller. You never know what could potentially get wound onto that brush roll, and it\\'s super easy to pop it out and clean it off (if you\\'ve ever had a large vacuum, you should already know to do this as regular maintenance). Keep in mind that the harder that brush roll has to work, the more pull it puts on the Motor. Stressing that little thing will potentially take away from its life of service.  Final Thoughts? I love it and would recommend it to anybody and everybody. And if it\\'s on sale it is HUGE bang for your buck$!  ** I gave all 5 stars except the 4 on Deep Cleaning ONLY because of my own beliefs that you need to get out the big vacuum at least once a month (depending on your environment maybe a little more often).', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 153, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Cyn4600'}}, {'title': 'This works great!', 'body': \"We have a 3 bed, 2.5 bath 2 story town house. Our home has 4 people and 1 cat. We have had this 12 days and have used it about every other day.  This works great! Our downstairs is hardwood and our upstairs is carpet. It does great on both floors. Couple of issues it does have. I have a standing ott light in the living room for sewing, it does try to climb up the stand and get stuck, same with our stand-up fan. Our downstairs is a hallway, living room, kitchen dining and half bath. it does a great job sweeping there, I do pick up the cat toys before turning it on.  When we want it to vac the upstairs, we move the base upstairs and only have the doors open for the rooms we want it to clean. (Upstairs we have 3 beds, a bath and laundry room) But it picked up plenty of cat hair in our carpet that we didn't know was there, and we have a short-hair cat. Our upstairs bath has a rug with long fibers, so I don't let it go in that room either. But it does great in the larger master bath that has no rug.  I have the Shark app and Alexa. I usually don't use the app or Alexa to turn it on as I want to make sure my daughter has picked up her legos and that the main bathroom door is closed. For downstairs I pick up the cat toys and the breakfast bar stools. However, it does get under our entertainment center just fine and it navigates any cords on the floor without a problem. Additionally, I have a sewing space in our dining room and it gets little threads easily. It has a large container to collect the dust, but not as large as a traditional vac. However, it is easier to vacuum more often with this as it does it on its own, so as you use it more often, hopefully it has less to pick up. The vacuuming process is longer with this than a traditional vac, but that is okay, I don't have to be with it all the time like I do with a traditional vac. When I want it to clean a different floor I just take it and its base upstairs, plug in the base and press the button. I make sure that notifications are turned on in the Shark app and it will notify me if it has gotten stuck. Although I have it linked to Alexa and I use Alexa often and have several Alexas in several rooms, Alexa never gives me notifications on this. But this isn't something that bothers me, just an fyi if that is important to you.  Couple of things. I have 5 children and 4 are grown (my 23 year old and 8 year old live with me) I don't know if I would have used this as much when I had small children and lots of toys around. Although it would have vac'd around them, I don't think it would have done as thorough of a job. I also like to be home when it is running, so I can keep an eye on it in case it gets stuck. It doesn't get stuck often, but I wouldn't want to come home and find it was stuck and hadn't done what I expected of it, but that is my personal preference.  Overall, I love this thing. I think it does a great job and is easy to use.

Saw a great pre-Prime Day sale for this one, read the reviews and ordered one. We\\'ve had it about 2 weeks and have run it all but perhaps 2 days of that. We get a lot of dust in Central Colorado thanks to our near non-existent humidity and we\\'re impressed enough with this that it\\'s now programmed to run daily. It can keep up with that bit of maintenance for us for most of the time and we can do more of the other things we\\'d rather be doing. Only time will tell how it holds up, but so far we\\'re pretty happy with it.  Very good suction on our all-hardwood main level floor (about 1300 ft) that includes many area rugs, many obstacles, a large black dog shedding randomly everywhere he can, and a central raised front entry area that cuts the vac off from much of the direct path between spaces on that level. Takes 90-120 minutes to cover the entire 1st floor spaces using about 80% of its battery capacity. Because of the main floor room layout & path obstructions, it spends a good portion of that time at the end trying to find its dock if it decides it\\'s finished while on the wrong side of our raised entry foyer. I\\'d expect it would handle a similar sized space that had fewer obstructions a bit faster (Maybe I\\'ll build it a set of removable ramps to get past the entry area). Still considering it\\'s doing the work instead of you, how much should you care if it spends 30 extra minutes doing that job. BTW, this low end model does NOT restart a cleaning cycle if it runs out of battery even though it does \"know\" enough to sense low battery and then try to find its charging dock. Bottom line - it has enough Battery to get its job done and done well and it recharges quickly enough that you can send it off elsewhere later in the day (or night)  This is a random pattern vac-bot - that is, it runs along until it bumps into something and then redirects depending on which sensor gets tapped. It moves rather slowly and while I occasionally cringe as it runs into some of our 3rd & 4th generation family heirloom furniture, it does not appear to hurt anything with it\\'s slow speed and soft rubber bumpers. Others have complained otherwise - we\\'re not seeing that.  It has no real trouble with the heavy oriental area rugs we have around the place and even the fringes (about 2\" long) along their edges on some don\\'t seem to be an issue. We have found a couple of places where we need to cut back some heavier (1/2\" thick) anti-slip rug pads so there is a bit of a ramp at the edge of the rug, but generally this little bot (we named her Rosie) has very little trouble getting up onto some of rather thick rugs. Thin bath mats or the bath towel our dog uses as a food redistribution and sorting location in the dining room are problematic. 90% of the time they\\'ll curl up and Rosie tries to go mountain climbing. She gets around or over those more often than not, but it\\'s easier to just pick them up temporarily. Power cords are also a problem, so we try to keep those up against baseboards or protected where possible. I suspect these are issues with most all of these robot vacs and also with the u-push it yourself types. It\\'s lower profile than some of its competitors, so on occasion it will find a path under something and can\\'t find its way out. This model did not come with any of the magnetic strips you can use to block it from certain areas, but we\\'re going to try some of those to keep it out of those areas. The bot has built in \"cliff sensors\" so it also won\\'t run off the edge of a stairway. It just senses the edge, stops and turns away. Haven\\'t had it take a tumble yet. The sensors do on occasion get fooled by the wood grain and abrupt grain based color transitions in our floors, but so what. It\\'s a random pattern robot, so it gets to those spots eventually, just from another direction.  The dust bin on this one is fairly large compared to others from what I\\'ve read. The first couple of times we ran it, the bin was well packed after both runs. By the third run onward, we started to notice a definite decrease and of much lower density. We generally walk around barefoot and my wife could politely be described as a clean freak so we were amazed at how much this little bot was finding compared to us with our larger and higher powered u-push type vacs and how much cleaner the floor felt.  After each run, we empty the dust bin, clean any dog (or human) hair out of the rollers and brush out the air filters. Takes maybe five minutes. It\\'s a bit awkward the first few times until you get the knack of opening the bin and how things snap or slide in and out. You do need to replace the brushes and filters at some interval that is going to be dependent on your surfaces and \"dirt profile\", but it\\'s likely to be measured in months if you just do the basic post cycle routine they recommend in the rather thin guide booklet.  Basically, this is a good little lightweight machine for a relatively lightweight price. If you want a robot vac, but the prices of the units with more bells and whistles are scaring you off, this is a good choice to test the waters. If you find you like it but wish it had a few more capabilities for some areas, buy a fancier one for another level or that area in your home. If you find you don\\'t, you\\'re not out a small fortune having paid for features that while nice, are not going to change your life either no matter how cool. I think some of the relatively few bad reviews are from people that expect too much or don\\'t take the time to let their robot \"teach\" them how to successfully use it. These are not Star Trek level intelligent devices. Bend a little to meet their needs however, and they are really helpful gadgets to have around.  Now the bad news and why I took off a star. The APP / Alexa Skill. Clearly the developer thinks they have better things to spend their time on. This is one the poorer set up apps I\\'ve seen in a while. Awkward to use, out of date, would not recognize the model number as valid even though it scanned it from the QR label without issue, awkward connection to WiFi network and disconnects / fails to reconnect (worst of my 24 other very reliable devices on my network in that regard). Low functionality, but if you want to integrate with Amazon Echo/Alexa or Google Home for voice control you need it. It\\'s also handy (when it works, which is still most of the time) to let you know if the robot got stuck somewhere or has run into an issue. You can live without it, but it would be soooo much nicer if this app was a bit more user friendly and reliable.

I used to have the RV750/R75 until the motor or something in it that spun the brush roll failed after 2 years and Shark CS advised me that particular unit was obsolete and replacement parts were no longer made. So I bought this, the AV751.  It\\'s dumb as a stump in comparison. It rams into everything (causing it to push around smaller/lighter things), never goes into edge cleaning mode like the other one did, pushes the magnetic strips around, and will even run into its own dock (moving it so that sometimes it can\\'t dock when done)!  It will also randomly stop then play its \"starting\" music/tones and start going again, resulting in the run time as shown in the app to reset. It has also on occasion suddenly started from the dock without anyone telling it to! (Though this is usually some minutes after it returned to the dock on its own, but not due to low battery.)  It also seems to have this issue with the magnetic strips when it goes into dock mode. If it is attempting to return to dock, but is in some area where it can\\'t detect its dock, and then it runs across a magnetic strip, it will become obsessed with attempting to find a way around the strip. It\\'ll either eventually succeed (I\\'ve come home before and found it in an area it shouldn\\'t have been and couldn\\'t figure out why), or it\\'ll eventually give up and stop, sending a notification to the app saying it is stuck on a magnetic boundary strip.  The dust bin is also designed differently and, in my opinion, poorly. The lid is held shut with a couple small balls that fit into holes on the bin. As a result, when opening, it sort of \"pops\" open, causing a small cloud of dust to poof out. I have bad allergies to dust. That small poof is enough to put me out of commission for the rest of the day if I breathe it in. The old model unit I had, the lid merely rested on top of the bin, so this was not an issue. In this new unit, the filter can also sometimes slip out while opening/emptying because of the way it\\'s designed and positioned (again, not an issue with the older model).  Otherwise, the battery life seems great compared to the old model I had. Lasts about twice as long. However, for whatever reason, the unit won\\'t actually run the whole duration unless it can\\'t detect it\\'s dock (ie, putting it into another room). It\\'ll only run about an hour (half duration) before auto returning to the dock.  This unit is dumb enough that it\\'s making me regret my decision to buy it....  Update (4/22/21): So, to make matters worse, this morning I woke up to the unit making a beep every few seconds. Couldn\\'t figure it out, so called Shark.

It\\'s on me to swap the brushes, roller, battery, etc to the new unit. *rolls eyes* But then, they need to check the warranty status to make sure I qualify. Excuse me??

I like it for what I paid. I got it on sale on Prime Day. Now that being said. I would not pay full price for this vacuum… keep reading and I’ll explain why. I think it is listed as like $220 right now at full price. I got it for I believe $130 on Prime Day. Why I wouldn’t pay full price: It does not have mapping. This means that the robot just bounces around to clean. It has zero rhyme or reason to where it goes. It bumps & turns. When it bumps again it turns. & it doesnt turn slightly. Sometimes itll turn 45 degrees. Sometimes 90 degrees. Sometimes 180 degrees. Like I said. No rhyme or reason. It does goes over my very thick fluffy rug with ease & my low rugs which is good. It did start having paint scuffs on it from the base boards from how frequently it bumps so I put the little sticky foam strips around the entire thing to prevent damage to my furniture & stuff. It runs for a good two hours with a full charge. Connecting it was an absolute pain. Theres apparently a bug in the software that will only allow it to connect to your network if the SSID does not have any spaces & instead uses underscores. For example my network name(SSID) is Connecto Patronum. To get it to connect I had to enable a guest network & name it Connecto_Patronum. I used the guest network bcuz I did not want to change my networks name & then have to reconnect every device connected. Also the vacuum only connects to 2.4G networks. It isn’t too loud but the bumping makes more noise than anything. It’s an okay vacuum & after letting it run for an hour & a half it did get a lot of hair up. I plan to just use it as maintenance for cat hair but thats about it. For my first vacuum it does an okay job & I will probably use it for about 6 months to a year before I upgrade to one with mapping as I wish I knew it wasn't missing spots & bumping into everything I own. It really is a stupid vacuum. But it’ll do for now because I don’t feel like returning it. But I wouldn’t really recommend buying it tbh.

Another issue is that the battery does not last long enough to thoroughly clean the house. Every morning, I would have to get out the hand held portable vacuum to suck up all the hair devils that formed under my kitchen counter chairs during the night-hair which should have been vacuumed up by the iRobot the day before.  Then I ordered a Shark. What a difference! The Shark rarely, if ever, gets itself stuck. It is able to vacuum my bedroom rug, which does have a little bit of a pile to it. (The iRobot was unable to vacuum it.) The Shark runs and runs and runs, thus thoroughly cleaning the floors. No more hair devils to vacuum up every morning! I also have made note of the fact that the Shark is designed to not get hair entangled in its beater brush, spinner brush, and wheels. I can not say the same for the iRobot, which needed a thorough cleaning at least twice a month.

My wife has back problems, so I am stuck with the task of vacuuming. And he who does the vacuuming loves the robot. This isn\\'t the sharpest tool in the shed (there are more sophisticated robots that have more features), but I appreciate his simplicity (and yes, my robot is a he). He is very determined as he zigzags around the house cleaning for me. I am always amazed at how much dust he picks up, even if I run him daily. So, a few tips: 1. I didn\\'t realize at first that I could set up notifications in the Sharp app. That\\'s quite useful. If he gets stuck, he cries out, but sometimes I don\\'t hear him. The notifications help me to go rescue him promptly. 2. We noticed that we were getting a few dings near the bottom of our furniture. The solution was to purchase insulating foam (the sort of stuff you place around doors to seal small air leaks) and stick it onto the front of the robot. That cushions things as he collides with your furniture. But don\\'t cover his \"eye\" or he won\\'t be able to find his base. 3. You\\'ve got to turn him over sometimes and check the roller. My sweetheart\\'s hair tends to get wrapped around the ends of the rollers. Thin stringy things (such as tooth floss) can get caught too. 4. Our battery lasted a little over 3 years, and then he started acting tired. It\\'s easy and inexpensive to find replacement parts on Amazon (a new battery, fresh filters, etc.). Battery replacement was straightforward after watching a few Internet videos. 5. There are certain spots around the house where he tends to get stuck (narrow spots and at the top of stairs). I have learned those, and spend a few minutes putting up barriers before starting him up.  Overall I love this little guy. He has made my life so much easier, and I gladly put in a few minutes time to empty his belly when he\\'s done in trade for not having to vacuum myself. Even my wife, who was a major robot skeptic, has come to really like him.  You will ask why I purchased this model when there are more sophisticated ones. Initially my wife was vehemently opposed to having a robot vacuum. So I picked up this one during a sale figuring that I wouldn\\'t be out a small fortune if she just hated it.

I read reviews and understood before I bought him what his capabilities and limitations are so I had fairly low expectations. He arrived and husband read the book. He’s really simple to use! We charged him overnight and when I woke up the next morning my husband had started him by pushing a button on him. It’s that simple. When you want him to stop just press the dock button on his back and he goes to his dock station. We says he’s taking a nap. If his battery is going to die, supposedly he will go the dock station. So far we’ve just hit his dock button and he stumbles around like a drunken sailer in the wrong directions for awhile but eventually makes it “home”, and backs himself into his dock to recharge. We have major construction going on in the basement and we haven’t vacuumed upstairs in a while. He picked up so much dust and clumps of dust bunnies that got tracked into living/ dining room! He’s super random but somehow he gets the job done, just leave him alone. I can describe him like the old pong game. He hits an object or wall and kind of bounces off in a diagonal trajectory. He’s low end so he doesn’t map or learn the floor plan. When you watch him, you find yourself talking to him, like “go left, no not straight”, but he goes where he wants and picks up a lot of dirt on the way!! He navigated our shag rugs! I couldn’t believe it! He went under the bed with suitcases and should have gotten stuck and didn’t. We call him row-vee and he’s like our little toddler (our kids are grown). We put up a barricade by the stairs. When he looked like he was going to get stuck, I started to go to him and my husband said, “Don’t pick him up. He has to learn how to get out jams by himself”. I laughed so hard. He’s gotten stuck twice and he beeps for you, like a toddler calling for help. Keep in mind that there are some robot vacs that cost $1000.

A lot of stress, my own-self moving between several houses, dealing with animals that aren\\'t mine making houses disgusting, life being so generally uncertain at any given time here in the ole US of A, and during all of that, I know if I walk over, hit the \"MAX\" button on my little shark, at least all the dog fur, the dust, and most of the dirt on the floor is gonna be gone in a few hours without lifting a finger. This has been so massive to improve my quality of life. Not to use Amazon Dot Com as my therapist, but when I got this I was dealing with loud, disgusting, dirty, not-cleaning-up-after-pet roommates and I was hoping for SOME saving grace and help in the house. The little shark has been my super hero, and honestly the cleanest roommate I\\'ve ever had. I went from floors tainted dark from fur and dander, to pleasant to look at carpets and hardwood floors that i dont even have to pre vacuum before inviting guests over.  That sounds silly, and is probably exaggerated a bit, but for real, having this cheap little robot just do his daily cleaning, leaving me less stressed with my day to day tasks knowing at least my floor will be clean in hectic households has an importance worth more than money.  THE GOOD: 1.) It cleans. It does a pretty d*mn good job at it too. As I said above, life (for everyone) has been hectic the past few years. It seriously turned my gross floors (i absolutely didnt touch the floors for a week knowing it was in the mail, had to put it through the ringer when i got it) into something I could walk barefoot on without having to clean my feet before going to bed. It isn\\'t perfect, it doesnt get as deep as a decent vacuum, but hey the first 80% of a job is the most important right?  2.) battery is great. It\\'ll run in max mode for at least a few hours, and it\\'s never died before cleaning whatever floor i put it on. It\\'s been running in my room the entirety of writing this review (about an hour since i hit go) and only lost 1/3 bars of battery. Battery is easily a 5 star, and you can get new ones on the shark site.  3.) serviceability. As a firm believer in right to repair, this is massive. And why despite the bad down below, I plan on keeping this. You can take 90% of it apart with just your hands and no tools, and all the wear parts are incredibly easy to swap out. As of writing this review (june 2022) I can find all the parts online if i needed directly from shark.  THE BAD: I would not buy this at full price. I got mine on a massive black friday sale, and on top of that, had a gift card from work. All in all, I only paid around $20 of my own cash for this which is probably why I love it so much. Its not without its fair share of problems though.  1.) The internet will not work. I have tried /everything./ This is a home filled with IT professionals and resetting, using different devices, giving it it\\'s own 5g, or 2.4, or hybrid network will not get it to connect. Tried 3 android devides running different versions, tried 2 IOS devices using different versions, and it just absolutely will not connect. Tried again after a few months hoping there would be some updates, no dice. Tried different router, nothing. Tried an entirely different house, different router, different service provider, and device (in case it wanted a change of scenery I guess?) and nothing. Definitely something faulty from factory. This is why it\\'s 3 star. I\\'m sure if I could get it to connect, it would update and get modern firmware that fixes other issues, which will be listed below.  2.) the pattern (without internet at least, which is the only way ive been able to use this as above stated) is ENTIRELY random. My roommate has a much more expensive ECOVACS Robotics - DEEBOT T8+ for a different floor of the house, and let me say, it does this sharks job better in every single way. The shark just bounces in every direction using a shotgun approach to clean the floor. It gets the floor clean, but it could do it much quicker and much quieter if it used any kind of AI or mapping to clean the floor.  3.) doesnt know how to drive straight always. The random mapping works via shotgun approach as stated above, but it will occasionally miss spots as it forgets how to spin the wheels at the same speed and does massive archs over areas instead of straight lines. Its intermittent though so I cant tell if its intentionally programmed to do so. This alone wouldnt make me drop a star, its more of combined with other issues.  4.) gets clogged with dust quick, losing suction. A bit hard to clean the pre filter. I do live in utah, where its dusty and i expect to clean any device with an air intake more than most other places in the country/world. That said, it clogs pretty quick (each use basically) meaning I have to get my portable air gun and spend 5 or so minutes blowing it out each use. Again, nothing horrible. Just worth noting.  SUMMARY: This little guy cleans. He\\'s kinda dumb, bumps into walls, gets stuck in small spaces on occasion, hates the internet (who doesnt at this point?) but he\\'s been an incredibly welcome and reliable addition to my life and i dont regret paying the 20 or so dollars to get him.', 'rating': 3, 'helpfulVotes': 329, 'reviewer': {'name': 'coyotesnax'}}]}, 'reviewsTotal': 3042}, 'product4': {'reviewsPaginated': {'reviews': [{'title': 'Perfect For the Price Point, a Pet Owners Must have', 'body': \"I have 3 dogs that have a doggie door. To pick up all the debris they bring in, I use this Roomba almost everyday. It’s basic and I have not used the wireless feature yet, but also don’t see a need, so I can't comment on that. What I love is having a vacuum robot like the Jetzens! Yay for technology! I have a few minor dislikes: It could be quieter, it misses dirt, and I do not like cleaning it. I spilt flour on the flour and it didn’t pick it up no matter how many times I coaxed it back. It gets stuck and can’t find its way back out of a few places like, under the sofa, between the legs of one of my tables, on the pedals of my piano, and 2 places under the cabinets. That said, it doesn’t do that every time. Emptying the dust compartment can be messy, as well as, cleaning the twisted threads & hair off of the rollers that needs scissors and a pry tool to clean. It’s time consuming. Also, don’t throw away your broom and dustpan yet, you’ll need it to clean the spots it misses. Right now it’s vacuuming under the sofa I’m sitting on and has found its way back out, it headed to the aforementioned table as I write and is not getting stuck. It also finds things like the back of my remote control. It will chipper as it scoots things around to alert you of it’s findings. It’s powerful and I’ve found it on top of my piano pedals diligently trying to clean them. That’s powerful! I also have another basic model from years back that still works and yes, I run both at the same time. The older model is not as effective or powerful. A few days ago, I noticed the bristles on the edge cleaner brush were completely broken off and the wheel was damaged. A quick, same-day prime delivery offered replacement parts at a ridiculous low cost & easy fix.

I have been wanting an automatic vacuum for quite some time but was hesitant that it would actually clean good. I still have to learn how to use this and see if I can set boundaries with this model but straight out of the box and not even fully charged for my first use (I would recommend charging it the full 3 hrs. as suggested, I accidentally started it and let it go!) it did great. The photos are from running two days in a row and as you can see the dirt bin is full so it is definitely cleaning. I’m hoping I can program it better because right now it seems to be all over the place and it doesn’t fully get one area before moving on to the next and it misses some trash/dirt since it is sporadic. I will update on that after I’ve learned how to use it! I’m happy with this purchase as of now. If you don’t want to clean the bin every day or two I would recommend getting the self emptying model. I just wanted to try the basic vacuum for now and see if it was worth it. I am a professional cleaner and so I have high expectations and so far this has met my needs. It has some “sweeper legs” that get in corners or edges like under counters and sometimes it does miss stuff but I know it is working as I have to empty the dirt bin frequently. It’s making my life a little easier! We named ours Dusty! It is not too loud but if your on a phone call it’s best to go to another room as it can be a little distracting. I set mine to go off at 12 pm every day and like clock work Dusty comes out and goes to work! The app was super easy to set up and like I said I am still learning and hope to set up specifics if I can with this model. The only issue I have had so far is that it will get stuck on a couple of my rugs. They are thick rugs so one it just stops and the alarm goes off for an error that it could not move. The other rug it says it is near a cliff lol! It isn’t that high of a rug but it is higher than the hard wood floors I have. I just move it and press start. It is a little aggravating but nothing too bad. I’m home all the time so I can move it but if I wasn’t I’m not sure if I could do anything from the app (again, still learning!) Also, make sure cords are picked up and if you have any sticky bug traps I’d move them because the little sweeper legs have gotten stuck to mine and I had to pull it off.

It does a great job picking up hair, dust and light debris on the floor. It\\'s great to have a \"second set of hands\" to keep up with cleaning between regular vacuuming and cleaning if you like a super clean home. It doesn\\'t replace the regular vacuuming with a HEPA vacuum cleaner, but it does do a significant job in between regular cleanings. The dust bin was full each time we have run it. Impressive. It was easy to empty the dust bin and clean the brushes on the base of the cleaner. I do appreciate ease in cleaning.  It does well on hardwood floors, tile, as well as wool and sythnetic rugs. It is able to transition over thresholds and even lamp bases. As it is pretty narrow, it slides under the sofa and other furnishings to pickup dust and debris. You can program it to do regular cleanings so if you want the Roomba to clean on Mondays at 9 AM, it will do it or you can have it clean manually. This is available on the phone app. It takes about 90 minutes to clean and then it returns to its charging station. And you can move it floor to floor to clean other levels of the home.  It is not super smart as it bumps and finds it way around furniture and other things, but eventually it finds itself out of the location it got into. I\\'m ok with this as I\\'ve learned you just need to make space for it to maneuver and get things off the ground before a cleaning session. I don\\'t need it to map out my location as I prefer privacy over efficiency as my spaces are not huge. Because it can go over thresholds, it can sometimes get caught up on the base of our stools which is a metal, wire base. This is where the Roomba signals defeat and it sends an alert on your phone. It is a bit loud as you can hear it vacuuming through the house, but if you\\'re on a different level and you shut your door while working, it is hardly noticeable.

They gave it to me after they could not use it. I do have to say, it does its job. It goes over my rugs (no black rugs), carpets, dark wood vinyl floor. It does a decent job of picking up dirt and debris. HOWEVER, it is VERY loud. I cannot be on the phone or be watching tv and have it running at the same time. There are no settings to change this, it only has 1 suction setting. As for the app, its basic. Almost anyone can use it. It doesn\\'t offer what some other apps offer. It does not map out your home, you cant see what areas it cleaned within the app, it simply tells you how long it ran for and how many \"dirt events\" it counted. For this reason, there are some times that it has only cleaned half my home, docked it self saying job completed, when in reality it only did 1 large room for 15-20 minutes. I had to literally move it to the other rooms and start it for it to clean an additional room. It doesn\\'t always do this, only occasionally.  Overall, I wont say this is a bad unit. It does work and do its job. I think its great for people that are looking for something basic or for people that aren\\'t tech savvy. If you want something that\\'s a little more in depth on what its cleaning and to use it from the app, I would recommend upgrading to a different model or different brand altogether.

Would I recommend it to a friend? Not this model, no.  ————————— I am someone who can become overstimulated to the point of not functioning, and then let mess get even worse. I wanted to automate even just one process of cleaning my apartment in hopes that it will help me prevent my house falling into a depression mess. I have the Roomba 694 (I think) and have never owned another kind or brand so I don\\'t know how it compares to other models. I\\'ve had the Roomba since January 26th, 2022. If my feelings change, I\\'ll try to update my review. If you don\\'t want to read a novel, skip to the bottom!  Pros: - Comes with an extra filter - Easy to set up - Automated vacuuming that you can leave to its own devices. Really convenient. - 1.5 hour battery life, which I rarely run out of - It can vacuum all the way under the bed!! - Automatically spot cleans dirty areas, or you can tell it to spot clean a dirty surface - Easy to disassemble to clean/empty - Goes over uneven surfaces well/has no problem with that - Generally does a pretty good job overall. - Cleans my hard wood, linoleum, and carpet alike. - It\\'s pretty good at getting cat litter up, which is awesome, cause even my regular vacuum isn\\'t great with that! - It ran over a cotton ball that was on the floor and dragged/smushed it into the carpet and left a white fuzzy streak. I thought \"Man, that\\'s gonna take forever to get out of there.\" When the robot made its way back over, it went over the cotton several times and cleaned it so well it was like it never happened. - Doesn\\'t really get stuck too much - Makes a cute little song noise when it\\'s done or docks at its home base lol. It\\'s kinda cute (even though it\\'s inanimate)  Cons: - Small dust bin. It\\'s a small vacuum, so that\\'s a given, but you will have to empty it often. Luckily, that\\'s easy and does not deter me from using it, but using a normal vacuum will collect probably like 5x the debris. If you don\\'t want to empty it, maybe splurge for the self-emptying one. - Sometimes I have to \"babysit\" it. It will vacuum for half an hour only to miss the hall (which is not blocked off) or one part of the room. (I assume this is due to its random algorithm). It\\'s kind of annoying to have to pick it up, set it down where I want it, and turn it back on for another cycle. - It\\'s kind of loud. I know I know, it\\'s a vacuum. But it\\'s definitely not quiet enough for me to consider it peaceful, or even consider running it at night. If I choose to work while it\\'s running, I have to put noise cancelling airpods in with my audio playing and even then I can still hear it. You definitely wanna be awake while this is running -- don\\'t run it while someone is sleeping or napping. It\\'s also a little loud when it bumps into walls or doors; definitely a tough little machine that\\'s gonna bonk around. - When I send it home to the charge base, it will dock and I will check the app to make sure it connected properly and is charging. However sometimes, the next day or a few days later when I go to run a cycle, it tells me the battery is dead even though I have not moved it. I don\\'t know if my cats are knocking it or jumping on it and moving it off the plates, but it\\'s frustrating to have to wait for it to charge again when I tried to ensure that it was charging in the first place. - It\\'s not great for deep cleaning. It\\'s a round vacuum and it won\\'t get into super tight cracks or corners. This is a good vacuum for every day, general cleaning but don\\'t expect it to leave the place 100% spotless.  OVERALL REVIEW: For a little less than $300, this robot is a good value. It helps make my life easier, both when I\\'m motivated or when I\\'m having a hard time. Honestly, the battery thing and the babysitting thing are what kept me from rating it 5 stars. All in all though, I recommend it!  Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely.

Sweeping felt like a full-time job. Enter the Roomba Essentials, my new cleaning buddy. It’s definitely not perfect, but it sure beats sweeping every. single. day.  I picked up the Roomba Essentials as an introduction to the world of Roomba, fully intending to upgrade later. As long as you know this isn’t the most advanced Roomba, you’ll manage your expectations and won’t be too frustrated by the occasional hiccup.  First off, its main job is to relieve you from daily vacuuming or sweeping duties, and it does just that. It connects to your smartphone, allowing you to start it, set a schedule, and send it home. It also gives you a handy map of where it’s been, so you can keep tabs on whether it missed a certain spot. It also comes with Google and Alexa functionality, so you can talk to your voice assistant and have it begin a job at your command.  But it won’t learn your home’s layout like the pricier models. You’ll still need to do a little prep work by clearing the floors: cords, shoes, or anything it might mistake for a light snack need to be hidden. Trust me, it has a weird appetite for power cords and phone chargers. . . .  It mostly manages to avoid big things like baseboards, doors, and anything low enough for it to sense directly in front of it. But when it comes to low hanging edges like the underside of the kitchen cabinets, or a piece of furniture with too low of clearance while still being strangely high enough to avoid its sensors? It’s more of a ‘bump and hope for the best’ kind of strategy. I’ve watched it play demolition derby with all sorts of different pieces of furniture or obstacles more times than I can count. But it\\'s never aggressive enough to mark anything up or cause any damage.  Despite the occasional confusion, it handles my 2-bedroom, 2-bath apartment pretty well, and the battery lasts plenty long enough to finish the job on the highest suction level, assuming it doesn’t get stuck in some bizarre nook and cranny...  On the plus side, it’s quiet – much quieter than your standard upright vacuum. The only time it really raises its voice is to let you know it’s stuck or when it’s taken up that new hobby as a furniture boxer.  iRobot makes maintenance super easy. There are guides and repair manuals in the app, which is great. But replacement parts aren’t exactly cheap. The app will also tell you when something needs replacing, so you’re not guessing when to switch out a part.  If you’re expecting miracles, this little guy might fall a bit short. It’s the slightly more clumsy, budget-friendly cousin of the Roomba family. . .But if you’re looking for a reliable assistant to cut down on your daily sweeping and vacuuming, the Essentials does the job, quirks and all.

If you're considering buying one, here's a brief pro/con list:  Pro: -You can just turn it on and off it goes! It's really handy to be able to go about your day and just have the vacuum zooming around the home doing the chore for you. -Small! It's not super large or bulky so it can fit literally anywhere in the home. I currently have it sitting in my living room since it's not in the way of anything. -More quiet than a traditional vacuum! Compared to regular vacuums this one is fairly quiet and doesn't disturb the home environment as much, and also may not scare your pets (I have 2 cats who aren't phased by it whereas with other vacuums my cats were terrified of them).  Con: -This particular model of iRobot doesn't connect to the app (at least mine didn't, so you may encounter this as well). You don't need the app, to be completely honest, but it IS helpful. -You HAVE to make sure ALL ITEMS are off the floor! As cool as this little robot is, it's not a genius. It can and will suck up anything that's on your floor, including cords, loose carpet fibers, etc. -It's not THAT smart! While it does a generally good job of vacuuming, it's not perfect. In my opinion, if you're wanting some general spot cleaning, this is perfect. However, if you're needing more specific cleaning (like a mess on the carpet), the traditional vacuum is the way to go. I WOULD NOT get rid of your traditional vacuum, just keep it handy for when you need it (like vacuuming the stairs or something). -The BIGGEST con in my opinion--the size of the dust bin. Obviously, it's much smaller than that of your traditional vacuum, so it needs to be emptied much more frequently. Depending on the amount of traffic in your home and if you have any pets, and also how often you vacuum, this could mean cleaning it out almost every single use.

I can work on stuff with it in the room and it does not bother me at all (my dog also does not mind it). -works great on white carpet and easily transitions from my living room to dining room (which has a slight bump). -when its low on battery, it does not die where it is at, it just turns off the vacuum then finds the home doc and charges itself. -just works really well. I run it everyday and I am impressed by how much stuff it gets (especially when it goes under things such as the couch). -if it gets caught on a cord, it usually takes 5-10 seconds but then it stops the suctioning and moves away (releasing the cord or other item). However if you have a small cord you should put it up (and you should regardless, I just noticed it doing this a few times and thought it was neat, but I do try to pick up all cords).  What could be improved: -nothing really in particular to this. -It does not work well on anything black, but this is true for all robot vacuums. It sometimes gets stuck when it goes on the black carpet we have with the black chairs (I suspect because it can not detect them), but this has not happened often. My dog has a black mat for her food and water and it always bumps into it and spills the water, but again, this would occur with any robot vacuum. -Also, make sure the doc is against a wall because otherwise it will move and never charge (self explanatory, but I did not do the first time and it kept trying to doc and was just pushing the doc around the floor). -Finally, you do have to dump out the vacuum particles almost every time you run it (if you do a full circle/battery cycle). It is really easy to dump and beeps when it needs to be emptied. Again, nothing really negative, just something to note.  Overall, I really like this! It does a nice job cleaning up the dog hair and other things that get on my floor and saves me a lot of time not vacuuming daily.

I was never willing to pony up hundreds of dollars or (gasp!) $1,000+ for a robot vacuum. The $139 Eufy has made my entry into the world of robotic cleaning a good experience. In the past, I have relied on Rubbermaid\\'s (Commercial) Microfibre 18\" mop and Bona hardwood cleaner. I still do for spills and mopping my upstairs hardwoods and vinyl planks on the ground floor.  This modest Eufy 11s Max does a great job of picking up the cat hairs from 4 furry friends, tracked cat litter, dust and all the rest of the debris that magically accumulates on 3k sq. ft. of flooring. Its cleaning power improves and eases the way for any subsequent wet mop scenario.  - Excellent along baseboards and thresholds, hardwoods, vinyl planking, under sofas - Quiet - Automatically increases suction power on carpets (iQ) - The remote control allows me to easily direct the 11s Max to different rooms I want to clean - Very good at avoiding falling down stairs - Renewable parts on this unit are easily available and reasonably priced - Ricochets around like a drunk...but knows its way \"home!\" - Source of endless fascination for the cats  -Not so good on Persian, Afghan or Caucasian carpets with fringe. (I fold them up or, in some cases, tuck the fringe under the carpet ends. I prefer to use a good vacuum with less brush action on fine carpets.)

To add to the mix, I have three cats whose favorite hobby is shedding. A 60 year old, self-avowed cat lady, I could not keep up with the dust and hair. I had a Shark robo vac which I used on a carpeted floor. It did not do a great job, and I was constantly getting messages that Lurch's sidewheel was stuck, usually under a king sized bed. I would have to rake it out from under with a golf club. The Shark also left cat hair in the carpet. I took the Shark, along with my three cats, to my Florida condo where there was no carpet. The Shark still got stuck, could never find its dock, and just didn't do a great job cleaning.  This Eufy beats that Shark like a drum! I have no carpet in this house, but do have a couple of washable rugs. Eufy does a great job on the LVP, hardwoods, and rugs alike. The only time it has gotten stuck was when it sucked up an electrical cord. Its bumper is more sensitive than the Shark's, so Eufy doesn't push lightweight items around.  Eufy was easy to set up, and did a good 30 minute run right out of the box. There's a remote control with it, and a nifty tool for cleaning the brush. The instruction book is a bit vague on what all you can get it to do, and the icons in the book didn't match up with the ones on the remote, but I haven't used the remote for it yet, as it runs perfectly by just pushing the go button on Eufy's back.  It sucks up and collects all the cat hair it can find, and is still getting its share of construction gerbis. I thought I would never be able to walk barefoot in this house, but Eufy has changed that!  Eufy finds its dock when the charge gets low. Its low profile enables it to get under sofas and chairs.  The collection tank is easy to empty and clean. The brush is easy to remove, and the tool makes for easy and quick cleaning of it.  Eufy is reasonably quiet.  My only complaint is that Eufy doesn't sense stairs and drop offs like my old Shark. The first time I turned Eufy on, it raced straight for the sun room doors, and over the edge-a good 6 inch drop-and landed on its back like a dying bug. The construction is strong enough to withstand the drop, but I block off that opening when Eufy is now on the job.  Eufy's full charge gives a long run time that will clean a good 1000 feet of space.  Overall, Eufy is a powerful little vac, and well worth the price. There's no app, like with the Shark, but you can set it to run with the remote.  If you have hard floors and pets, don't hesitate to get this thing!  Caveat: I cannot attest to how much cat weight Eufy will support, as I cannot get mine to ride it.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 57, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Avid Reader'}}, {'title': 'Not durable, makes loud noises after a short time', 'body': 'At first, I loved this little thing, and like many named it (Gary). It was impressive how every day it had a tray with a bunch of dust and dog hair in it. In my experience with vacuums and electronics, your product will last much longer if you take good care of it. Before going to bed, I \"Gary proof\" the house, picking up any random charging cables, socks, etc, and putting the dogs up so they don\\'t have an accident streaked all over the house. I run it early morning at 2am. I empty the tray every morning, which takes less than a minute. Every week or so, usually monday morning, I spend less than 5 minutes to take the side brushes and roller off, and remove any hair/strings. This is probably much more frequently than you HAVE to do it, but with my experience in maintenance, I prefer to do it more often and regularly.  He\\'s a dumb vacuum, and occasionally gets stuck in weird places, or will grab a low hanging wire and get caught up, but it\\'s a good thing he\\'s dumb. We don\\'t have true AI, so spending a ton on special sensors and algorithms to pretend that a smarter vacuum has been created, is just a waste of money. When looking at reviews for all the major robovac brands, they all get stuck occasionally and have issues. I don\\'t care that Gary sometimes gets stuck, because it doesn\\'t happen too frequently. A dumb robovac that runs regularly and has a decent battery life will make for a much cleaner home, and with much less effort, than vacuuming on my own. Will it sometimes miss a spot? Sure, but it eventually gets to it. Are there spots it can\\'t get to? Yes, but those are spots that I\\'d have to get the hose and attachments out for anyways. Up to this point, I\\'d give this vacuum 5 stars. It\\'s effective, and at a much more reasonable price than the competition. It does everything I need, and doesn\\'t have a lot of extra crap thrown in there. So, why 3 stars then?  It\\'s not durable. There is something wrong in the design of the roller brush, or the containment of the roller brush, and it starts making a loud vibrating noise after a few months. I purchased it in May of 2018, and by August it was ridiculously loud. After a bunch of minor tests, that were already answered and then ignored in my initial email, and video I provided of how loud it was, they agreed it was faulty. Anker/Eufy sent me a replacement, after I sent mine back. They let me keep the extra accessories, such as the spare side brushes, the hair removal tool, and even the charging dock, and sent me what appeared to be a brand new robovac, packaging and accessories just like it ships from Amazon. It\\'s now February, and the robovac is making the same loud noise again. I\\'ve done some extra troubleshooting on my own, and narrowed it down to the brush, or brush holder. As it\\'s spinning, it\\'s vibrating. All of the contact points are plastic. If I take the brush out, it stops vibrating. I put some thin foam tape between the enclosure of the brush and the plastic casing that holds it in, to see if the brush was causing it to vibrate. That didn\\'t stop the sound. It\\'s like the brush is bouncing around in it\\'s housing. It looks like the spinning brush wears away at the casing that holds it in place. I don\\'t see a way to repair it on my own, or to prevent it from happening again. We\\'ll see how Anker handles the issue the second time. I\\'m not looking forward to dealing with it again, and I\\'m hesitant to recommend this to anyone else.  It\\'s important to note that I work from home, so running it during the day isn\\'t conducive to me working. When it\\'s working properly, it\\'s quiet enough to run at night and not be a bother. It will randomly bump into a door sometimes, so if you\\'re a light sleeper, it may be a problem, but for our family it\\'s not an issue. It\\'s only after it degrades and start making loud noises that it\\'s an issue. If you have an empty house during the day, and it wouldn\\'t matter if it\\'s extra loud when it runs, then it would work perfectly fine.  Edit:3/11/19 After some confusing back and forth with Eufy Support, they\\'ve replaced my 11S with a 30C and even through in some boundary strips. Initially they just wanted to replace it completely, but I was concerned that it would just break again, this time out of warranty. They offered to upgrade to the 30. After I sent it, another support rep reached out saying they should have troubleshot the robovac more, and not to send it in as they had some other tests to do and if that didn\\'t fix it, they could fix the roller. I let them know I already sent it. I asked if they could send me a 30C so I\\'d get wifi as well, and I\\'d pay the difference. They said they couldn\\'t ship the 30C because Amazon owned it. While waiting for my robovac to get to them, the 35C came out, and it\\'s listed for sale from their website. I asked if that could be sent instead, and again I\\'d pay the difference. They said they couldn\\'t, but they\\'d ship an extra boundary set for the confusion earlier. I thought they said they\\'d send the 30C, not the 30, so responded that would be good. They cleared it up saying they could send the 30 with an extra boundary strip or the 30C without it. I chose 30C without. They decided to send the 30C and the extra boundary strip! Way over the top support, trying to make me happy. I wasn\\'t upset, or being a jerk about it, they were just extremely accommodating. Based on the great customer support (minus minor confusions, some on my part) I\\'m bumping it up to a 5 star. They really stand behind their products.

Lots of negative reviews from people who seem to have not understood that this is a random motion robot. Keeping your expectations in line and realizing that even with a random pattern the whole house will eventually be covered at least every few days, which is way more than I ever vacuumed manually.  Another source of bad reviews is the frequent comment that it is \"lacking\" internet connectivity. For me that\\'s a huge bonus as I didn\\'t want an internet connected device because many consumer grade IOT devices have very poor security.  I bought two similar models, one downstairs and one upstairs. We have dark laminate flooring downstairs and it felt like even if I vacuumed regularly there\\'d still be stuff showing up shortly after I finished. I\\'d do a whole house vacuum every week, but it still felt like I couldn\\'t keep up, so I initially bought the 11S+. I loved it so much that I bought this 11S Max for upstairs just a short time later.  Since the 11S+ is so similar, I\\'ll combine details from both in this review as they\\'re relevant here too.  For context, this is in a household with two long-haired adults, no kids, no pets.  Downstairs on laminate and tile flooring with only an area rug and fairly basic furniture everything works perfectly. The initial robot got stuck once on day two in a corner where I had some chairs stacked up and gained the nickname \"Waldo\"... \"Wall-e, the garbage collecting robot... got stuck... where is he? Where\\'s Waldo?!\", but hasn\\'t gotten stuck anywhere since. It reliably finds its way home every day. Every day at lunchtime I come downstairs from my home office and empty the bin and I\\'m shocked by how much stuff is in it, wondering how I ever lived in such dirty conditions! haha  My wife and I agreed that this is the best thing ever, so I bought another for upstairs, which has carpeted floors. Things are a bit different there. Nearly every single room upstairs has an obstacle that it doesn\\'t like, and I\\'ve had to do a LOT more robot-proofing.  It found its way into the walk-in closet and got tangled on a shirt that had a string fringe and got stuck. It gets up on the legs of the clothes drying rack in the bedroom and makes a LOT of noise going over them, repeatedly. It got stuck under the bed in the guest bedroom that had JUST enough clearance to get under, but not back out. In the home offices it gets hung up on desk legs. In my office it gets up on the legs of my music stand. Once it started beeping after going a bit too far over the edge of the stairs. The downstairs robot can go about its business daily w/o any problem, but the upstairs one has a problem in every single room. I\\'m gradually finding ways to deal with the problems room by room (such as 3d printed bumpers on the desk legs), but it has been somewhat of a challenge.  Like the downstairs robot it\\'s SHOCKING how much crap the thing picks up every day, even after a deep vacuuming with our Sebo D4. Being as this one gets stuck so often it got the nickname Dodo. I still love it, it keeps things cleaner, but does require a lot more babysitting. Over time I expect it\\'ll get better as I continue to robot-proof to keep it away from areas where it shouldn\\'t be.  As for the long hair mentioned before: On day 1 I tested before a deep-vacuuming, with about 2 weeks of accumulation and it got REALLY tangled with hair, but I did a deep vacuuming by hand and since then it has kept up enough that hair has not been a problem at all.  Pros: Very quiet, good coverage (I seldom see a missed spot), picks up a crazy amount of stuff even when you think there\\'s nothing for it to find, cheap maintenance parts, easy setup, no apps nor wifi connectivity to phone home and potentially compromise your home network.  Cons: None if your house is robot-proof, some people may have zero problems, some might have a LOT of problems.  The filters for the MAX are a bit harder to find than the non MAX models. I did try to swap the dust bins between my two units and they are interchangeable. I\\'m not sure which filter is better than the other, but I might eventually replace the dust bin with one from an 11S so that I can use the more commonly available filters. I suspect that the filter change is part of why the MAX models have a higher suction rating as the simpler filter probably has less air-flow restriction, but I do like having the pre-filter on the other unit as it\\'s easier to keep clean.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 174, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Barefoot Guy'}}, {'title': 'The Best Cat Toy That Cleans Even Complex Home Layouts', 'body': 'I always thought these robot vacs were kind of a silly gimmick, too expensive for not enough gain. After a couple friends raved about their robovac\\'s, I made excuses like \"My home layout is too complex!\" and \"I\\'ll need three of them to vacuum my home!\" But, the robot wars have made them cheaper and better, so I decided to finally give in on a good deal with this new model from a well trusted brand. I wasn\\'t willing to pay for units with home mapping features and no-go zones, but with this unit, I don\\'t feel I even need it. Turns out, I am absolutely thrilled with the performance and price point of these Eufy\\'s.  There is little doubt this unit is just slightly smarter than a bag of hammers. Thank goodness I can make it do it\\'s work at 4AM when I don\\'t care how many times it goes over the same spot or misses something that is just \"right over there you stupid bleeping robot!\" But, day after day, this hunk of electronic sensors strapped to a vacuum comes home with a bin full of stuff. I\\'m at the point where I don\\'t even know where it gets the stuff and I\\'m seriously questioning my ability to clean my house. And also somewhat ashamed of the filth that I\\'ve lived with and didn\\'t even know about.  It goes places it probably shouldn\\'t and if you have any degree of OCD, it will hurt your brain to watch it. It goes under furniture and shelving where it barely manages to escape, plays ping pong with table/chair legs for a bit and it has an inexplicable infatuation with the clear storage totes under my guest bed. It\\'ll really like one area/room for awhile, but then will go elsewhere, only to be back 2 minutes later...and you\\'re like, \"Well, that was the *least* efficient way to do that. Whatever, a goldfish is smarter than you.\" Whenever I\\'m in the kitchen doing something, it has the whole lower floor it could be cleaning, but it will insist several times on cleaning the spot right under my feet. It loves to chase my cats and in turn, my cats will engage it in a battle of home domination, swatting it and trying to eat the spinny brushes while it charges. One cat will lay on the lower step and lazily swat at it as it goes by. Just when you think there might be the slightest sense of intelligence and you\\'re having this \"It\\'s alive!\" moment, it reminds you how dumb it is by gently ramming itself into a piece of furniture. I don\\'t know how it does it, but despite looking like it couldn\\'t find it\\'s way out of a paper bag, it somehow manages to find home base for charging most of the time.  But, it gets around, even in an ever changing layout. It deals with my wood floors, several area rugs and a section of medium pile carpet without much incident. It hasn\\'t once tried to go over a stair in my home. It gets probably a good 70%+ of a complex, 1,000 square foot U-shaped layout of my main floor, with plenty of furniture making navigation much worse. But, it does that 70%+ every day and I don\\'t even have to think about it. Based on the sheer amount of cat hair and dust this thing picks up daily, I\\'d say the suction and pickup mechanisms are pretty good. I can\\'t tell you if they\\'re better than older Eufy or other branded units, but the spec\\'s say so.  I was worried about how much of my lifestyle I\\'d have to change to adapt to this thing. Turns out, very little. I can still leave stuff around if I want and it won\\'t try to eat everything in its path. It does occasionally try to commit robot death on various cat toys the kitties leave about, but that\\'s maybe one 1 out of 10 times it needs saving. I have a rug in my kitchen that it loves to push into a pile, but that\\'s only a minor annoyance and doesn\\'t cause it harm. I have to be careful not to leaving charging cords and such about. Once every couple weeks it won\\'t find it\\'s way all the way home, but it\\'s usually pretty darn close to the charging station by the time it dies. I thought it might become inconvenient to \"save\" the unit from it\\'s self-inflicted stupidity, but the value it provides exceeds the inconvenience.  I can see why people like these things. And there\\'s a good chance I may buy the three I need, maybe this one or maybe others. But, for now I\\'m pretty happy with this one. It\\'s a 5 out of 5 cat toy and a pretty useful home appliance that will save you time and improve your home\\'s upkeep. I\\'ll update this review with any significant changing opinions, but for now this \"dumb, smart thing\" gets 5 stars.  Update: About 4 months after running this thing daily, one of the side brush motors started to malfunction. Normally, a product malfunctioning that soon would irk me to reducing my review stars immediately, but I sucked it up and contacted support. I requested, specifically, to do a self repair of the brush motor right out of the gate. They didn\\'t request for me to send it in for repair, demand an expensive cross shipped replacement or question my self-assessment to repair equipment that I owned. They just told me they have the part in stock, requested I send them a video of the problem, asked for the address and put the brush motor in the mail. They then confirmed that if this didn\\'t make it work right, they would still support me until it did. They worked with me exactly how I wanted them to, stood behind their product 100% and for that, not even a single star will be reduced from my original review.  Update 2: I knocked two stars from my review. Not because of the unit, which is still great, but because of the replacement air filters. They are $11 for TWO of them! That\\'s nearly 3 times the price of the previous filters, or about a $65 annual operating cost when changing them out once a month. IMO, that\\'s simply too expensive for a vacuum and even my high end upright isn\\'t nearly that expensive to operate using *HEPA grade* vacuum bags. Not just that, they are incredibly terrible for the environment by requiring you to buy the substantial plastic filter housing every time. Had I known this at the time of my purchase, I would have selected a different unit - probably the initial version of the 11S.  Final Update: I\\'ve decided to just let this thing die a slow and painful death. Both of my side brush motors went out, as did the one that I replaced. It\\'s still marginally effective without them, but definitely not as good as having them. Eufy\\'s support reached out to me several times, which was great, but I have better things to do than rip this thing apart every few months to fix plastic parts that will fail again in 3 months. I expect more from something I\\'m paying $200+ for, definitely not three of the same exact failures within a year.

As it moves randomly, it can take some time to vacuum a space thoroughly.', 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': 6, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Saturnine'}}, {'title': 'Well worth the money for saving time, energy, and effort', 'body': \"This (really long) review is for the Eufy 11S Max robot vacuum (Robovac). Please note “Max” vs regular 11S. They may look the same; but the Max uses a different filter and has the higher 2000pa suction. Otherwise the functions and options (other than suction choices) are the same. I've used the 11S Max for the last month on my low pile carpet (about 80% of the roaming area) with the rest being tile or linoleum flooring. It has been quite fascinating to watch so I've actually put about 85-90 charge cycles on the unit over the last month (yes, three times a day on most days and it's still finding more dirt/dust than I would expect).  Right up front, I'd definitely buy another when it comes time to replace this one. After comparing how I vacuum my flooring, especially to pick up my biggest carpet enemy; short stray bits of dried grass stems, the “random” wandering of this vacuum model made more sense to me than the other fancier choices. Most vacs do a good job with dust, dirt, sand, cheerios, etc. but these stem pieces are only picked up by a vacuum when it comes at the stem with the brush roller pretty much parallel to the stem. That means random directions will more likely get these pesky problems than an organized back & forth cleaning approach. Granted it may take a few cleaning cycles or several passes over the same area during one cycle; but since the Robovac has completed its first 5-6 cycles I rarely find them anymore or if I do spot one it's not for very long.  Robovac is a big time saver as well as an energy saver for me. I would use my canister vacuum about an hour each week for routine cleaning and once a month for 2+ hours to do a more thorough cleaning. A watt-hour meter indicated that my canister vacuum used 5-6 kw-hr of electricity each month. Robovac uses about 12 watts continuously for about 4 hours when charging (surprisingly less than the 5-6 hrs listed in the manual; but it is brand new). Once the battery is charged, the power consumption drops to about ½ watt. When Robovac is away cleaning, the charging base uses just ¼ watt for the homing beacon. So if used just once a day; Robovac would only use about 60 watts per day. That means once-a-day cleaning would only use 1.8 Kw-hr energy per month. By letting Robovac take over the regular weekly cleaning with once a day operation (or less), I'm able to cut my electric bill by an easy 3-4 kw-hr/month.  With that said, there are a few things that I think need improved:  First, there should be an interlock on the dust bin – Robovac will merrily go off about it's scheduled cleaning cycle without the bin installed! So if removed for emptying; don't forget to re-install the bin before the next scheduled operation. Plus, I noticed on a couple occasions, that I wasn't paying attention and I left one corner was about 1/8” out from fully inserted. Not sure if that will cause suction leaks; but you need to make sure the bin is completely inserted.  Second, you can't select “max” (or any power level) when using the remote to manually clean an area. It appears to only operate on “standard” suction with manual operation (i.e., when Robovac is not running a regular cleaning mode and you chose to override it's direction). In addition, if you select the remotes' edge or spot cleaning modes it will automatically go to “max” power for the duration of that mode and you can't choose IQBoost or standard power level on those selections.  Third, I don't know why the 20 minutes for edge cleaning or 30 minutes for quick cleaning was selected. Robovac can make it about 60-70% around my home in the 20 minutes of edge cleaning. If edge cleaning mode was permitted to run until it made a trip all way around and back to the charging station where it could dock to finish that mode would work better. An alternate solution would be if I could set the cycle time for edge cleaning and quick cleaning modes. Plus I'd like having an option for it to simply stop when the time is up rather than automatically returning to the base. When I want just one room cleaned; I'll set Robovac to auto or quick mode in that room, then close the door or put down a barrier, and return later to stop it manually and take it back to the charging base. If I don't return in a timely manner Robovac will be trying to locate the charging base and running the battery down.  Fourth, Robovac cleans edges using only its right side pretty much all of the time. It would be helpful to have it randomly choose using either the right or left side whenever edge cleaning. I watched it edge clean a carpet/wall area three times going only in a counterclockwise direction (right side) and it still didn't pick up all the dust bunnies. I used manual control with it hugging the wall on its left side and it picked them up with no problem. Also, be aware that manual operation, when Robovac is not already working in a selected cleaning mode (overriding current movement), only works while the remote buttons are pressed. Robovac stops all functions shortly after a button is released when used manually.  Fifth, I really don't need to run Robovac on a daily schedule – there should be a weekly scheduling capability even for the least expensive robot vacuums. It shouldn't be that difficult or expensive to update this model to correct this issue. Even if it's the same set cleaning time, every day for the selected days; just give me the ability to schedule cleaning cycles one to seven times a week.  Sixth, when the battery runs low, Robovac can take forever, if it makes it back at all, to the charging base. I will routinely go looking for it if I haven't seen it return within 10-15 minutes after the approximate cleaning time has passed. The age-old solution for solving a maze (your home from Robovacs' perspective) is to constantly follow along obstacles using just one side (Robovac does recognize when it's circling something like a coffee table and adjusts accordingly after a 360 degree rotation). This method is how Robovac tries getting closer to the charging station when it's more than about 15ft away and not in line-of-sight (the charging base emits an infrared signal for homing action – make sure you keep Robovacs' bumper and the base clean). Sometimes Robovac occasionally gets diverted or the software tells it to try something different) and it will go off in another (often wrong) direction (extremely frustrating!). I highly recommend observing Robovac perform it's return operation from various areas in your home. I ended up placing a 2x4 along the end legs of my sofa as Robovac was consistently going along the side skirt, under the skirt at front of the sofa, then around the front leg exiting the side of the skirt, and then heading straight across the room. It would then go thru three other rooms and come back to the sofa again. The 2x4 forced Robovac to continue edging under the sofa, along the back wall, and out the other end which has an end table that mimics the 2x4 at the opposite end. Before using the 2x4, Robovac took well over an hour to get back to the charging base (it eventually changes up it's routine, usually after three tries) and required 5 hrs to recharge. With the 2x4, Robovac has been able to get back from the far end of my house to the charging base in under 20 minutes very consistently. While the ability to improve Robovacs' return mode is really limited to what you can do, the key point I'm making here is that the battery will always give you more charge cycles (longer life) before needing replacement if you can get Robovac back to the charging base as soon possible.  Seventh, pay attention to the thin rubber wiping strip on the brush guard. After 60+ cycles I noticed the ends of the thin rubber strip (about 1/16” of it's height) were tearing away. I believe this was most likely due to moving back and forth over edging from tile/linoleum to carpet or maybe due to the floor mounted furnace registers in my home. I simply trimmed the torn bits off to keep them from getting caught by the brush. After about 100 cycles I noted the rest of the 1/16” strip was now gone. This impacts the tile/linoleum cleaning far more than carpet; but it is something to watch for. I highly recommend checking the rubber strip during brush cleaning and purchasing a brush guard replacement as part of a maintenance set. Hopefully the manufacturer will improve the thickness or type of material used to prevent or at least reduce this problem occurring in the future.  Next, a few helpful hints I've learned or didn't find in the owner's manual:  The “bowl” shape on top of the charging base with the white LED is just right to hold the remote control, button-side up. However, I prefer to turn remote controls' button-side down to keep them cleaner so it's up to you if you use it or not.  I've had a few occasions when Robovac actually bumped into the charging base so it was no longer sitting square against the wall. This will impact it's ability to find the base when the battery is low. I took a used rectangular-shaped one quart motor oil bottle from my recycling bin, cleaned it thoroughly, and filled it with sand. It's now a 3-4lb weight sitting on top of the charging base. I haven't had the base re-positioned since adding the weight. Normally Robovac does a good job avoiding the charging base; but not always.  Robovac “parks” about 1/2” away from the charging base tower. If you are careful, you can swipe a cloth over the bumper sensors to clean off any surface dust that has collected (always seems to be some); however, be careful as Robovac might activate while you are doing this. You might also get a solid red indicator without any beeps. This error isn't described in the manual; but I've found if I just lift Robovac off the charging base for few seconds and then replace it, it will change back to the charging orange color. (I suspect the solid red indicates a sensor error) It's also quite easy to remove/replace the dust bin during charging. Unfortunately you will need to flip Robovac on it's back to remove/clean the side and roller brushes as well as the bottom IR sensors and charging contacts, so remember to turn Robovac off with the topside button before doing this or get used to it trying to start up while you are cleaning it. Also make sure the blue/orange indicator light is on when you reposition it on the base. Sometimes Robovac will remain off rather than return to charging mode.  After two or three cleaning cycles I'll do a regular check on the all the brushes and swap left and right side brushes when they are re-installed; seems to straighten and make them work a little better, maybe last longer too.  Oddly the remote control spot clean button symbol and the manual indicate a clockwise spiral for the cleaning operation; but when I've selected it, Robovac has always used a counterclockwise rotation.  If the side brushes happen to “hang up” on something, Robovac will stop spinning them while it maneuvers around the obstacle and then restart the brushes when it thinks it is clear. Don't assume there's a problem when you see this unless Robovac beeps and the indicator turns red.  The flat handle end of a spoon or fork works great for prying the filter free from the bin for cleaning. Every time I have tried using my fingers; it pops out tossing dust/lint everywhere.  The IQBoost mode doesn't seem to change going from hard flooring to low pile carpet or vice versa in my home. I think this is because the low pile carpet just doesn't cause enough “drag” for it to recognize that it could adjust the suction level. (I'm still not clear as to whether there's just two suction levels or if Robovac can vary linearly between the two) While the manual indicates a 40 min run time in “max” mode with medium nap carpet, I'm obtaining about 60 minutes with my low nap carpet. I do find the “max” mode clearly picks up more dust. I ran Robovac 20+ times on IQ mode before switching to “max” for its scheduled operation. The filter has clearly shown a thicker layer of accumulation on the filter.  When “max” mode is set as default you will occasionally hear the vacuum whining noise change briefly. Best I can figure is it's a software glitch where the IQBoost code tries to adjust the suction level; but then resets it to max. I normally hear this shortly after Robovac goes from one flooring type to another. It also occurs shortly after it starts it's routine.  Robovac does not communicate back to the remote. So if for instance, you press edge cleaning and Robovac doesn't get the message, the remote will show it should be performing edge cleaning even though it's not. Similar situation when Robovac is recharging or is returning to recharge; the remote will still show it's in the selected cleaning mode rather than the “charging” icon. You simply have to pay attention that Robovac has recognized your command by a “beep”.  I found using the basketball nozzle with my Ryobi P737 inflator does an excellent job cleaning the filter. It takes only a couple minutes to clean both the filter and the bin (outdoors of course!). The original filter has been cleaned well over 100 times now and other than being a little dingy it's still working great. This should help stretch the recommended replacement interval to more than 2 months compared to the recommended “tapping it” to clean. Do not use the “canned” compressed air as I frequently find it wets surfaces during extended spraying and the Robovac filter is a paper element.  If you have a sofa, chair, etc, with stiff or heavy cloth skirting down to the floor; I suggest safety pinning up at least a foot or two of the skirting on an open side. When or if Robovac switches to using the proximity mode for cleaning AFTER it gets under the furniture, the skirt will appear like a wall and it will keep running around underneath the furniture until it switches to a collision mode where the weight of the skirt generally will not trip the bumper sensors and stop it from escaping.  I'm glad I've used Robovac during the daytime so I could track it down and figure out what trouble it got into during its normal operation or when I expected it to be back at the charging base. The alarm beep sounds can easily be missed when it's far away from you. Plus, when it powers down after getting stuck can make it lot more challenging to find! It's a lot easier to locate when the vacuum sound is still going or even if it's just the quieter wheel motors running it around looking for the charging base.  To wrap up my review. I've found Robovac to be a well built, nicely designed, and quite durable robot vacuum. The $160 price I paid is quite reasonable with excellent cleaning ability (given it has about 1/10 the suction of a typical canister vac). It has good battery run times (my mixed flooring on IQ mode lets Robovac run about 80-85 minutes before recharging), and it is a wonderful time and energy saver. If you've been thinking about a robot vacuum without all the extras (or just don't like vacuuming), the Eufy 11S Max is a great choice.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 438, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Andrew Bean'}}, {'title': 'Over a year in use... study this review for real analysis', 'body': 'Summary: I read a LOT of reviews about a LOT of products of a similar nature before I leapt in to buy this, my first robot. Overall, this product was good SOLID value for the money.  I have now owned it for for OVER a year now, used daily and this analysis is based on close observations during that period. NOT one of those folks who buy it an write a review five minutes after they pull something out of the box. Here are the key points you should consider when buying a Robot to sweep your floors.  1. Price - Look...Price was definitely a consideration at buy in. I studied many models before I bought this one. These kinds of robots overall cost money. $$$. Of course, I am old school. These days some folks buy a Cell phone that cost $500 dollars to $1000 and think nothing of it. To me that is WAY too much. Ditto many models of similar robots. At the time I bought it the robot was on sale so I got a price that was $100 cheaper than competitors whose reviews read about the same as this one did. So the buy in pricewise was a good solid deal that was in what I consider the medium to upper low cost affordability range. Perhaps you would think nothing of spending $850 on a robot. Not me. Like goldilocks, this one was just right. SECRET Costs you may not think about: Some reviews address this, but consider these things as being costs IN ADDITION to buy in: Filters: This thing has a filter. I recall one review whining that filters cost too much. Let me be clear. If you want a new HEPA filter for it every week or two, they will cost you. Me? The filter does not seem to me to very critical since I do not really plan on the robot cleaning my air. It gets dirty and dusty. As a result, I pull it every other use and wash it out under a faucet in my kitchen (a two minute job), let it dry a bit and then put it right back in the machine (Which is super easy to do...no tools or anything - just pull out - click in.) After reading one alarmist review prior to buying, I bought one spare filter at the same time I bought the robot thinking I might find it was true. So far, after a year or more of use, I STILL have not replaced the filter. Just keep using the original. Think about it. Brushes - I bought a kit with spare brushes when I bought the robot. Glad I did. Buy at least one set just to you have them around when you need them. The brushes twirl around and shove cat hair into the maw of the thing as it races around. Somewhere. Somehow, as it toodled about around the six month mark, it threw a brush. (They snap on and off easily) Like a horse throwing a shoe, this is to be expected. This thing runs all over on its own so I could not find where it lost it. To this day I STILL have not found the missing brush. No problem. I just grabbed a spare, snapped it on and it kept on going. Tools - The kit I bought early came with a little cleaning/maintenance tool. See my section on Maintenance below about tools.  2. Utility - Utility to me means ease of use. Based on a year of hard use for my robot you should consider the following lessons learned about utility: CLEANING FLOORS a. Does is really sweep ALL the floor? Read a lot of reviews and looked at a variety of designs. Some reviews that I recall said \"This thing finds a LOT of dirt. Where does it get it all?\" After a year of emptying it (You DO need to empty its evening sweep into your trash, usually every day - VERY easy to do - again click out- click in) I totally agree! This thing finds a TON of dirt and dust that is NOT obvious to the naked eye. Frankly, that is its job and I need to make clear here that it does its job really really well. VERY SATISFIED b. To be utter clear however... I have a three story house. To define that though that is two stories with WOODEN and some tile Floors and a third floor that is mixed wood, carpet and concrete. PRO: I cheat. One robot for three floors of my house! Every day or two I pick it up from its charger, move it from floor to floor to let it clean a different floor whenever the mood strikes me. Works great! More, this thing cleans almost all of those floors flawlessly - especially the wood, tile and concrete bits. It sneaks into lots and lots of corners, under furniture and stuff and it never, ever runs off the edge of stairs. Completely satisfied. I admit I may be so satisfied because wood, tile and concrete are 92% of my floors and it is flawless on those types of floors. CON: This is a real review, not a feel good propaganda babble. If there is a con to this robot it is carpets. Specifically, it WILL work across modern carpet. That is carpet that is tight, laid level with the rest of the floor and has nothing to hang it up on. However, it struggles to go over edges, so if there is an edge to your carpet, a strip that it has to ride up over OR (Like me) you have a carpet or two that are Persian Style rugs with tassels at the end, just be advised that it WILL choke as it tries to cross these barriers. You can still do these surfaces, but you will have to stay nearby and bail it out when/if it hangs up... which feels time wasting. This should not make you hesitate to buy based on this review UNLESS you have a lot of these carpet barrier things about your house, in which case you will be annoyed by this robot. To be fair however, you may be annoyed by ANY robot under those conditions. Just think about it before you buy. ******** Utility NOTE! This is a final note on utility. The REAL Nemesis of any robot is WIRES/Cords. Once you own one, you will figure this out pretty quick. You will need to get your cords under control since the robots will find power cords on computers, lamps etcetera and choke up on them. 80% of the time when it does not return to its charger at after you program it to clean (Smart folks program that between 1AM and 3AM - unless you tell it to go manually for some reason) you will have to track it down to find it hung up on wires. Once again, to be fair, I think this is true of virtually all robots. They are not too bright about wires. The other 20% of hang-ups comes from some oddity in your furniture. I have particular chair in my study whose side supports are JUST a bit too short for the robot to go under, so it drive in there and wedges itself into the spot and cannot get free on its own. Just to you know, this is fair enough, robot makers cannot anticipate every single possible piece of odd furniture. Just figure it out through trial and error, but enjoy all the cleaning it does WITHOUT you paying the slightest attention. A small price to pay. *********Utility NOTE 2: The control - Comes with a remote. To be frank, I only use two or three features on the control. I tested them all at the beginning, but I\\'ve forgotten what the rest do. Most used? Manual use button. Because of how I use it on other floors, the automatic run feature is only good on one floor. Works flawlessly as far as I can see. I tote it to the second floor, put it down, hit the manual timed button and off it goes. I wander back up an hour two later, hit the off button and walk it back to its charger. Second most used? The recharge button - This tells it got back to recharge station manually. If you you do not want it to keep going you can interrupt its cycle and it will go back to its recharging. Usually use this when I am watching a show, it starts on its own and I find the noise distracts me from watching. Third most used feature? The manual steering controls. One review I read said this machine is really stupid. That is half true. It does fine most of the time, but if you want to steer it manually on occasion you can. I have a table I want to make sure it does under in a certain way, so I just point and click it to drive it into the bits when I want them to be cleaned.  3. Maintenance - Look. Old soldiers will tell you. Preventative maintenance will allow you to keep using your equipment day in and day out. This robot IS reliable IF you know you will need to maintain it! If you are lazy you will hate doing maintenance. I just make it part of day\\'s routine and do not resent it. Thus I am very satisfied. My routine is to pick it up about 5 PM, sit and work on it for three to five minutes WHILE I watch TV. WHAT? You cry! Why so much work! The work is there because the robot does its job. All you are doing is making sure it keeps doing the job without hassle. Once again, whatever nonsense if advertised, I imagine ALL robots require this kind of looking after. PLAN on it. This one I suspect is no better or worse than any other. Do not go into it blind though. Here is what you need to know: a. You will need a little tool to do maintenance. If you buy the little kit with filters, brushes and a tool in it, know this. The tool is a hokey little plastic thing that CAN work... but takes a bit more time to use. Specifically it has a comb to clear tangle in your brushes. This works well. It has a little brush to brush dust off filters, off the inside of the dust/dirt collection box, etc. This works adequately. It ALSO has a little razor blade letter opener thing on one side intended to clear hair from rotors (Two types) This is a weak tool that works, but is time consuming and tedious to use. You are better off getting a little tool with steel blade or hook on it. Something you can use to really dig hair out of spots where it winds itself around a brush or rotor. Dig through your kitchen drawers, tool boxes or the $2.00 bins a the hardware store until you find something that works better for you. Maintenance: Enemy number one if long hairs. I have two women in the house. I am sure they do not mean to shed, but shed it they do somehow. This is what happens. As the little brushes turn they pick up hair and push some of it into the bin...BUT they also wind around and around the spinning brushes. Every other cleaning I find a wad of it around both brushes. There is also a rotor on the bottom the turns and does the sweeping up.. It ALSO picks up long hairs. Some will wind around the rotor proper and must be cut off or pulled off. This is the easy part. The hard part is that some will wind around at the ends where the bristles stop. This is where the recommended tool I mentioned will pay for itself as the hair tends to knot up tight in wind after wind. You will have to dig it out and cut it loose. You must also empty the bin at the same time. I also wash the bin out now and then along with the filter. Once a month or month and half the front wheel may also need to be tugged out (It pulls out and pushed back in easily) It ALSO gets hair down in there around its axle, though not nearly as fast as the rotors and brushes do. That is it. I will only close by saying I have NOT owned every robot in the world, but I imagine these periodic maintenance requirements will be very similar for ANY robot... NOT just this one, so if my maintenance picture here appear to be too gloomy, don\\'t let it be.  OVERALL: I am totally sold on having a slave machine keep my floors swept. Rather it than me! Call me lazy bones. A little maintenance now and then is well worth this machine. Go ahead and buy one.

With the bad, let us get that right out of the way. The mapping is abysmal, truly, we have run Bruce (if you can name a Shark branded robot vacuum, what other name than Bruce would you choose) 25 times, he is nowhere near mapping our house, compared to my brothers robot from a competitor who rhymes with BOOMBA, which did it in three runs. This Shark does not even play the same sport....this prevents me from doing room specific vacuuming. And that is it. Unless you have a multi story house, where this feature is a must have, set Bruce and he will clean you house. Wonderfully. Next, the not so great, Bruce is so mentally challenged. For a smart device, he is pretty dumb, but you want to know something, Bruce is determined. He will get the job done. He may have to fumble and bumble his way about, but he will get it done, and, if you watch, he does get a little smarter each time, just a little, but it is noticeable. Bruce used to do the house in large, long swaths, now he breaks it into one half of the house, then the other, and just the today, a new feature, he went around the perimeter of the house, cleaning the base boards. Small steps. As for his vacuum, top notch, perhaps too good. Bit of advice, if you get your own Bruce, run the beast on low suction for at least the first 4 or 5 runs....another con, Bruce does not know when he has eaten too much, and like a greedy guppy, he dies...locks up and cries for help... remember, I told you Bruce is not bright, but he is a work horse. When this happens, you cannot tell Bruce to restart, he has to start over, and hopefully one of Bruce\\'s engineers will fix this, since Bruce will never know how much he has consumed, he has not the ability. Perhaps a command to send him to his base to empty himself, or a shorter duration than the 30 or so minutes it defaults to. Oh, and the base, the self empty….I am sure robot vacuums before the base were fine, if tedious, since you had to clean them every time….but the base, oh the base is pure genius. Bruce’s base is perfect, we take up with a button, and open it with a button, and never have to touch the refuse. No bag to buy, just push a button, the bottom opens and all that stuff drops out. If you have not noticed, but this family loves Bruce, we are now looking at getting Bruce a skin, to spruce Bruce up a bit…We have had Bruce for a week now, barely, but already Bruce has made an impact. I absolute honesty I cannot recommend this product enough, it works, it has quirks, but it works, and very well. Bit of advice Turn on all your lights until your Bruce gets a good map of the area, he is a camera based robot and needs to “see\" the ceiling, mostly, for landmarks. Run it on low the first few tries, while Bruce bounces around the first few runs, then move to medium and so on. Remember, Bruce has no sesnor in his bin, he uses a set algorithm that tells him to go back to his base and dump his load. It is terrible. But his vacuum is great, so he gets too full too fast. I can manage it a little for the quality of his cleanup. Because our house is neither toddler nor robot ready, we did not have all our rooms ready, and so we began mapping with the bedrooms and bathrooms doors closed. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, the mapping is not great, but it does move forward, slowly. Bruce stared being more efficient in our great rooms’ right about the time we added the bedrooms and bathrooms. Our house, 3 bedroom, 2 bath, 2 great rooms and a heart kitchen, Bruce can do it on one charge now, I think because we basically added one room a day after his initial runs. I think you can tell, Bruce has been a wonderful addition to our home, truly, a robot vacuum was a luxury I didn’t think worked. It works and now I know what gift I will give every new home owner I know. There a lot of options out there, some a lot cheaper, and if those meet your needs, get them, some a lot more expensive, and aside from one specific feature Bruce does not have,( multi floor mapping) I cannot imagine they are better.  UPDATED 2/19/20 Mapping works now, had to delete the map once , run it three times, and bang! house mapped. Room specific vacuuming unlocked! Suggestions to others having issues. Delete the map and ( and I think this part is important) run the vac with every light you can on. The robot \"see\" and makes its map on your ceiling, the more light, the better it see\\'s. To reiterate, my little robot, Bruce, has literally changed my house...cannot recommend enough.  Updated 2/5/21 A year later and no regrets. One of, if not, the best purchases I have made for my home. I will state again Bruce is an addition to the house and family, he is almost a pet....a very dumb, but very hard working pet....he is like a toddler...he seems to always want to be where you are... He cleans your floors and carpets...If you are on the fence about buying a robot vacuum...let me put you at ease...buy one, this is no longer a luxury to my home, they are a requirement, utterly worth every penny. As for a Shark...I love mine. Works great, does what it is supposed to do. The only house I wouldn\\'t think this is perfect for is multi floor homes. Short of that... a must have.  4/28/23 Still the best purchase we have made for our home cleaning. No change there...but a small observation...recently replaced some furniture and changed the layout of our home. We had to move the dock from a north to south orientation to an east to west...and, I swear, it now navigates even better than before.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 1252, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Richard Hennry'}}, {'title': 'Great little robot cleans all our hardwood floors. Great customer service, too.', 'body': 'When my wife and I downsized to a home with about 1000 square feet of living space, we knew we wanted a robot vacuum to keep the 80-year-old white oak floors clean. We wanted four things from our robot: A self-emptying dustbin and charging station, to have it connect to Alexa so we could verbally have her tell the robot to start cleaning, and to be able to tell it to go clean one or more specific rooms.  Roomba and Shark both have systems that can do all those things. We chose this Shark IQ system because there were lots of reviews saying they did a better job on hard floors and because the Shark vacuum is quite a bit less expensive.  We have no regrets. The Shark IQ is a great system for our needs. It will clean all six rooms on our main level and our two small hallways on a single charge, it efficiently navigates its way back to the self-empty charging base to empty its dustbin when it fills up, then returns to where it left off and finishes the job and returns to its base to empty again and recharge.  Alexa integration is pretty good, too. When my wife or I leave for a long walk or to run errands we ask Alexa to, \"Tell Shark to start cleaning,\" then tell her, \"Rosie Jetson\" (the name we gave our Shark), when she asks, \"Which robot?,\" and off Rosie goes. By the time we get back the vacuuming is done. Yay!  Some reviewers have claimed their Shark was not able to map out their home\\'s floorplan. We didn\\'t have that problem. After about a week of cleaning our home Rosie Jetson had mapped our floor plan. Once that was done I spent a few minutes outlining each of our rooms in the Shark Android app, gave the rooms names (kitchen, dining room, etc.), and that was it.  Once our floorplan was entered we could ask Alexa to, \"Tell Shark to clean the kitchen.\" Then, after clinging to the left wall of our living and dining room and navigating around our dining room chair legs, Rosie makes it to the kitchen, vacuums, and returns to base. Job done. Awesome!  OK. Now it\\'s time to tell you the sad stuff. Rosie was not our first Shark IQ robot. The first unit we received from Amazon was a refurbished unit, and it was defective. Our first Shark would not connect to our home WiFi, so it could not communicate with Alexa, my smartphone, or map out our floorplan. We called Shark for technical support and, after trying to troubleshoot our robot for 30 minutes, Shark Tech Support declared our original unit dead-on-arrival and sent us a brand-new replacement self-emptying Shark system. The replacement works like a charm and Shark\\'s customer support was excellent.  There are also some things Rosie doesn\\'t do well. She doesn\\'t sweep nto and vaccume all the way into corners and other spaces she can\\'t fit into including a cornet next to our sofa that has an end table with legs that are too close together for her, she gets tangled up in lamp and extension cords (more on that in a moment), we have a set of lightweight nesting occasional tables that she pushes around an inch or two each time she bumps into them,and my wife\\'s tennis shoes, which live under our dresser, get re-arranged and pushed to the back against the wall when she vacuums.  I addressed the problem with lamp and extension cords by buying a cord protector/cover and will build a little wooden square of 1x2 furring strips to put under our dresser so my wife\\'s shoes don\\'t get pushed to the back. Simple fixes, but you should be aware that robot vacuums aren\\'t smart enough (yet) to avoid these shortcomings.  So here\\'s our bottom line: We\\'re really happy with Rosie Jetson, our Shark IQ robot vacuum.  Pros: * Does a great job of vacuuming our hardwood floors and the carpet mats at our two entries. * Maps the floorplans and can be told to vacuum a specific room. * Self empties its own dustbin into the charging base. * Cleanings can be scheduled using the Shark app. * Responds to voice commands to \"start cleaning\" via Alexa or Google Home.  Cons: * Pushes lightweight things around sometimes. * Cannot clean into corners or tight spaces, so you\\'ll still need to vacuume manually now and them. * Dirt doesn\\'t just disappear. You have to empty the self-emptying base now and then. You also occasionally need to clean the floor brush, particularly if you have household members with long hair. * Rosie Jetson, the Robot Maid from the Saturday Morning \"Jetson\" Cartoons I grew up with, could dust, too.

You do have to clean the vacuum parts every once in a while. will get stuck on fabrics on the ground (clothes, dryer sheets, etc)  After having this for about 6 months I would recommend the vacuum for someone who has a lot of hard floors or regular dry messes but not to someone with spills or a lot of carpet-to-wood floor changes if they have heavy shedders. It\\'s helped tremendously with the dust in our house as long as we clean the dust filter regularly.  With shedding: We have three almost 100 lb dogs which are heavy shedders and live in a very dusty place. We run it every day and even through shed season, our floors looked great! It doesn\\'t get the hair as much off our carpet so we still vacuum the carpets once a week or every other week. If we had done that before it would have looked like a hair storm went through our house! The brush roll did get stuck quite a bit at first but some WD40 and popping both ends off the roller to clean them helped. One end of the roller does not want to come off at first but once you get it, it\\'s easy to clean. With the 60-day tank, we dump it about twice a month so I think for a normal household it would last 60 days.  Initial setup: it was frustrating because it didn\\'t map the house how I wanted it to. I must\\'ve mapped the house 4 times before getting one that was similar to ours. It helps to push the manual button to clean and it helps it map much better.  Carpet vs hard flooring: It functions great on all our tile, wood flooring, and even cement( escaped into our garage one day when on \"clean mode\" not mapped). The main issue we\\'ve had is the transition onto the carpet, the brush roll cleans off all the hair so all the rooms we have carpet in now have a line of dog hair entering the room. I think it would be pretty good for someone who has fewer dogs. Once it\\'s on the carpet it works great, even makes those lines in the carpet. Picks up dirt very well on carpet and hard flooring.  Noise: It\\'s a background noise when vacuuming much like a dishwasher but when it\\'s clearing the vacuum dustbin into the base it sounds like a normal vacuum.  App: works great. I do wish there was a feature to run certain rooms every day or different areas on different schedules.

I had bought an early model from another brand, and it would randomly run until it hit something turn and repeat. This was basically useless. It never really cleaned, and was constantly stuck, or ran out of batteries before finding its way back to the base. This couldn\\'t be more different.  Setup: I was tentative from the start. But, I told it to start mapping and forgot about it. 15 minutes later I saw it on the base and assumed I never started it or it failed, so I opened the app and saw a highly detailed map of my house. I was amazed. It had mapped and returned to the base so quick I assume it didn\\'t work. I used my phone and assigned room boundaries to the map, put a DO NOT GO zone over the basement stairs to be safe, and setup the app to auto vacuum at 6am on M/W/F.  Running: I have had only one time it needed intervention. It sucked a small cat toy into the roller and detected the strain on the motor and stopped, asked for help. It took about 60 seconds to open the roller, remove it, remove the toy, and put it back together. It resumed the process and finished. I have had it for months and that is the only time I have intervened.  Vacuum quality: Each time I empty the bin I am horrified at the amount of dust and cat hair that it is picking up. It is running 3x a week, and in one week it takes a kitten worth of hair off the hard wood, and enough dust to make you queasy looking at it. It is a powerful vacuum, it gets the entire house when it runs, and does a great job, but it is quiet enough to run without waking anyone up.  Pros: Setup, simple. Set and forget. Empty once a week or two or three. Almost no human intervention required. I don\\'t prep for vacuuming, don\\'t tidy up, don\\'t do anything. It just works and works well. Lidar constantly updating the map, it rarely touches anything, so it doesn\\'t scratch walls and furniture, it uses sensors and lidar to \"see\" the obstacles and work around them.  Cons: It takes a recharge to fully do the house. We work from home and I can\\'t tell it the order to vacuum. So sometimes our offices are the last rooms, and by the time it runs, recharges and starts the second half I am already working and it wants to come vacuum my office.

I bought the RV1001AE back in November of 2019 and am just now looking at a replacement. Not due to product failure but because I’m looking at a 2-in-1 to save time and floor space etc. In a time when most appliances seem to have planned obsolescence it’s worth noting this is still a very good machine after almost 5 years of regular use.  For context- I have one cat, hardwood floors, and no carpet just a few low pile area rugs. It works well for me on a single level with 900 -1200 sqft apartments I’ve had.  Works well on hard wood and ok on small area rugs. Cleans up cat litter and hair well in general. ——— Noisy. Not as much as an upright or stick vacuum but still very noisy due to the mars-rover style wheels and emptying into the canister.  It will get stuck at least once a week but this is probably fixed with better sensors in the newer models by now.  This version has single pass only and I’ve noticed it can get turned around by my cat or myself if I move something in or out of it’s planned path.  Does not see obstacles well and I would recommend watching it closely the first time and putting down strips for areas it shouldn’t go. For example it gets stuck inside of a side table we have. It will go over the base and go around in circles and can’t get out again. It also likes to vacuum over the base of our floor lamps and my standing desk legs and my desk chair legs then gets stuck between the chair wheels or gets lost.  I try to schedule for a time I’m going to be away because it also takes about 2 hours to clean my 900 sqft apartment (because it gets stuck or turned around a lot) and it’s very loud with the wheels hitting things. Just need to make sure to pick up any cords or cat toys etc before leaving.  From what I can tell the matrix version uses a different system entirely instead of a single camera eye looking at the ceiling. If you can afford the upgrade I’d recommend the matrix version - it may not have as much clearance to go under stuff but it’s probably better at navigating spaces and won’t need as much supervision.  ——— Highly recommend following the directions and cleaning it regularly.  If any of the filters get too dusty it doesn’t work as well. (Which may be common sense but easy to forget when it has the canister)  Sometimes it will try to empty a few times because the back doesn’t line up perfectly. That’s because either the base moved a bit or it can’t get enough suction to empty into the canister. Easy to take apart and clean if that happens and also easy to troubleshoot in general.  Mapping on the app is “just ok” but that’s the norm for an older model.', 'rating': 3, 'helpfulVotes': 4, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Vanityvampire22'}}, {'title': 'The best vacuum robot I ever tried - reliable and cleans like no other', 'body': 'I was trying several vacuum robots from companies specialised in these robots. What should I say: they all were a disaster. My biggest disappointment was with the iRobot Roomba S9 - what a piece of overpriced wannabe vacuum robot. When the shark robot was on offer at Amazon, I ordered it and was very certain that I would return it again. Shark doing robots? Nope… I was sooooo wrong! Setting the vacuum robot up was super easy and intuitive. When I started the mapping run I thought it would take hours, but in less than 30 minutes my floor was completely mapped and as accurate as it could be (the roomba s9 was taking hours for the first mapping run and even after a 2 weeks cleaning period the maps were still very off). I have the Shark now over 1 months and this is not only a perfect robot but a superb vacuum cleaner. Compared to the roomba s9 this thing sucks all the dirt out.  I was one week on vacation and set the robot up to do daily cleaning runs (to get rid of the hairs of my cats). This never went well with my “old” roombas (“your roomba is stuck”). Not with this shark. Cleaned every day and never got stuck. Is there anything better than returning from vacation and find your home clean?  I can only highly recommend this robot. Definitly beats all the other once I tried and the price is amazing!', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 5, 'reviewer': {'name': 'New Kid on the Block'}}, {'title': 'Pretty easy to set up and operate.', 'body': \"I did a good bit of research before deciding on the Shark. We have a Shark upright and another dustbuster size Shark so we are very positive about their products. I chose a spot for the dock that doesn't really comply with the instructions but it hasn't affected the operation in the least. It is under a side table in a bedroom. Works very well from there. I used the app to map my apartment, which it did very well. I closed the doors to rooms i didn't want it to go - either because i just want them cleaned more thoroughly by our cleaning service or i thought it might get stuck on the rugs. It handles rugs pretty well, though. Minor complaint that others have mentioned: it doesn't take the same route each time. And it goes over the same areas more than once. The first time it ran, it got itself stuck under a low riser dresser so i now put a stool in front of the dresser to prevent that. I think the app is pretty slick and easy to use. You can set it to vacuum every day or any odd assortment of days. Ours runs twice a week to be sure the cat hair gets cleaned out. First run complaint: since it was vacuuming under beds, it was probably going places that had not been vacuumed in a long time. So that first time, it filled the bin with cat hair and just stopped in mid run. I had to take it back to the dock but even then it couldn't off load the hair. It was too full and compacted so i had to remove the bin from the robot and clean it by hand. That hasn't happened again though. Just be aware if you have any areas like that. The app lets you do the whole house, just one room, or a selected 5 ft square space. In the app, choosing Spot, it puts a square in the middle of the screen with the house map over laid. You choose the spot by moving the map under the square until it is over the area you want cleaned. It's not intuitive, but once you see it, you know how it works. I read many of the older reviews that mentioned a magnetic strip to keep it from going certain places like off a step. I was wondering where those strips were because mine did not come with any. I almost returned it before the first run because i do have a sunken room and was concerned about it going off the step but it ran right up to the edge, stopped, and then ran along the entire width without a problem. Pretty impressive. It will obviously have trouble negotiating table and chair legs so if you want those areas cleaned you will need to move the chairs. It would also be nice to know how to deal with the sunken area of our home. For now, i take it off the dock and carry it to that room before turning it on. It does the room completely and returns to the starting point where i again have to pick it up and return it to the dock. Then, i have to use the app or the button on top to tell it to return to the dock, which works ok. Im just concerned if this confuses the mapping of the rest of the house. I wish the instructions addressed this issue.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 76, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Rush'}}, {'title': 'First impression is this thing is very clunky.', 'body': \"Update to the update... So now this thing is working better. You've got to let this thing charge like 100%. Let it map the house. Then it works pretty good. It got stuck a couple times on some obstacles but I'm not going to knock that. Once you vacuum proof AKA childproof your floor. It'll work fine. Every time it's done vacuuming it dumps itself which is The first time I've ever had a dumping vacuum. It is definitely nice not to bend over and pull that dust bin out all the time with dogs. All in all I'm pretty happy with it. I'm knocking off a star because this thing is clunky. Even brand new it sounds like it's breaking. It's got like a grinding crunching noise when the bar spins underneath the machine. You also can't zoom into maps and see little tracks where the unit has run. Other vacuums has little trails on where the unit went. This just tells you it did that room in general. It would be nice to see the exact route this thing took so I can see if I have to put a no-go zone somewhere. Make sure you get it on sale and it's worth the money. End of story unless it breaks and I'll report back.  Update: Let it charge over 50% before you use it. When I set it up the app kind of let me run it right away and instead of mapping the house it just started cleaning. I put it back on the charger and let it go to 100%. It seems to charge very very slow compared to my last one. Once it was 100% charged it did map the house in about 15 mins and then it dumped itself and I set it off to clean. Seems to work pretty good over all. Lots of dog hair and dirt in the hopper. I will report back after a few weeks. So far I am happier than I was when I first got it so we will see.  I think it's important to log your first impression so here we go. It was well packaged I was pleased to see that. It takes up a good bit of space in your house so find a nice piece of wall. It had 30% charge when I set it up and for some reason it wanted to get started mapping my house so I let it. I'm coming off of a wyze vacuum cleaner. I had bought it twice from Amazon and I like it but some reason after a year the suction just seems to die down and no matter how much air I blow through it it doesn't seem to clean it out. Thus this replacement. My first thoughts is it's like watching Grandpa walk around when he's lost at home. The thing bumps into everything with no hope of actually having a plan. It still mapping my house so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt. Right now I'm not so impressed with the suction. I don't know if it slow suction down while it maps the house or what. It might be a little early to leave a review but I think it's important again to explain this in detail. Right now I've got a lot of doubt but will give it a couple days and I'll report back. One thing I really don't like is right now when I press dock it went the complete wrong way and decided to not dock. I liked the Waze vacuum cleaner because it went right to its home and knew everything was. I hope this works out better than my first impression.\", 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': 41, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Smith'}}, {'title': 'Best purchase for our home so far', 'body': 'Since we bought this in late November, which I suggest getting since it was newely half off its retail price of 600 (gotta love black Friday), I have only had to get out the old vacuum once. I was worried that we would have to get it out more than that to get under our cabinets in the kitchen, but that is luckily not a problem. If I see something under there now I just push it to the middle of the floor if I know shark is going to clean that day.  So here we go...  Pros: -it literally cleans about 95% of your floors. Hair is not a problem, tangling on the roller is not a problem, larger debris is generally not a problem (I had some things here and there get missed the first go around, but I mostly see that it has problems on carpets, which we have mostly hardwood floors so not a big deal). -it mapped out our first floor, which is sizeable, in about 2 go cleanings. I was worried about this as a large amount of reviews stated that it took 30 or more cleanings to map their house out and it still didn\\'t map it correctly. The one thing I noticed about these reviews is that they are mostly from from a year ago, so I\\'m assuming that there has been a software update since then to address this issue. It was super efficient at mapping. - I see this as a pro, but some might not, is that it teaches you to adjust your cleanliness behaviors. You need to keep the floors free of obstacles (as much as possible) in order for this robot to do its job, which means moving your shoes, picking up toys, moving chairs, etc. It was good for my wife and i to adapt better habits anyway and this was a good way to Kickstart that for our household. - if you have allergies, this thing picks up a ton of dust. Since we don\\'t have a pet (yet) it mostly picks up some food, hair and dust on the floor. Man does it help. My allergies have been much better over the past 2 months. - some people gave the app negative reviews, but I found it helpful overall. It is simple, easy and quick to make adjustments on. -you really don\\'t have to empty this but once a month. And, honestly, I could get away with maybe once every 2 months instead. Don\\'t forget to do a monthly maintenance check and clean the filter, but this is a 5 minute routine once a month. Much easier than busting out the bulky vacuum all the time.  CONS -speaking of the app, it needs a no go zone feature. The magnet strips, while great, don\\'t effectively help in managing the bots path all the time. Make sure to tape it or use 3m sticky stuff to keep it on the floor otherwise your bot will try to suck it up and take it for a ride with it. The no go zone feature would be helpful for wire areas, furniture, or kid play areas. I hear it is supposed to come along sometime in the future, hopefully soon. -carpet cleaning is a little bit of an issue. We have a giant area rug in our living room and it sometimes has issues with picking up stuff. Luckily, the bot does 2 or 3 sweeps, which most times gets the debris or fuzzies on our carpet, but not all the time. This is indicated on YouTube reviews that I watched before I purchased this, so I knew what to expect. -it is slightly noisy and takes a while to clean. I advise to make the schedule while you are not home, because it can change your daily routine pattern. Generally, it takes about an hour and a half to clean our 600 square foot first floor. I keep it on normal mode, but there is a higher power suction mode that is louder. So get ready to turn the volume up on your TV. I did hear from a roomba user though that this bot is quieter, so I guess it\\'s subjective. -this is more if a personal gripe, it might not be a big deal for you, but I was hoping to have a meet the Jetsons vibe when I connected it to my alexa. I wanted to say \"alexa, clean the kitchen\" and it do just that. Unfortunately, it doesn\\'t do different room commands, it just does its normal full routine. You can do this through the shark app, which is simple and easy enough. So designate room names and tell it to clean just that room. Still, if you have a kitchen mess and you want to use verbal commands through alexa skills to do something while you are continuing chores or cooking, it would be a nice touch if it did it. Oh well, that\\'s just me.  Overall a great purchase. Currently, I got mine for roughly 315 and I am doing monthly payments with Amazon, which I love this feature of Amazon\\'s payments. I pay it off in March in monthly installments of 64 bucks. It is worth the money compared to those roombas that cause double or triple the shark bot. I did a ton of research on different vacuums and this one is in the top 5 (as of right now). I highly recommend this to anyone with similar lay out as us (mostly hard wood floors with area rugs). I found the cons to be just nit picking at its performance, and overall it makes our life 80x easier. I give it a 4.5 out 5 for my personal home and I hope this review was helpful.  1 year update:  Dog hair: Still going strong and still highly recommend for those with mostly hard wood floors or linoleum. In fact, I recommended it to my mom and dad and now they have one and love it. We did finally get to test it with some serious dog hair. We had an Australian Shepard (which has super thick and clingy fur) and another dog that visited for several days. Both are extremely active and were all over our floors and our one carpet area. They left a ton of fur and it did take 3 or 4 cleanings to get up about 80% of the hair. Whatever was left over was bunched up on the carpet and was easily removable thanks to shark. Just be prepared to wait a few days for the fur to be cleaned up in the carpet. If it\\'s hardwood then it is cleaned up instantly.  Hair and roller blade: I have not had any issues with the roller blades and hair tangling. I had to untangle some hair that rolled to the center twice. It is an easy fix. Take scissors and a quick snip and boom solved the problem. The big thing is that it doesn\\'t hinder the cleaning ability of the vacuum.  Parts: I haven\\'t had to replace any of the parts yet on it. Just keep up with monthly maintenance and it will hold up. Clean the filters and the dust cup monthly and it will run smoothly. The battery life is still the same too. No issues with battery degradation.  Errors and software stuff: so the errors are minor with this robot. It is the occasional bumper is stuck and that the dust cup needs to be emptied, which is nice if you forget to keep up with maintenance. The only issue I have with the software is that it used to be able to clean specific rooms when I originally got it, but now it doesn\\'t allow me to do that at all. It\\'s a bummer since sometimes I still stuff in the kitchen and I just want it to do that room, not an entire cleaning again. Also, and this is a small gripe, but I wish that I could have the robot automatically go to max suction mode every cleaning. Instead, I have to go to my shark app on my phone and change it from normal mode (which is its default cleaning mode) to max.  Overall, I would still say this is a 4.5 out of 5. Minor issues, but still totally worth it.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 965, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Scott McDowell'}}, {'title': 'Navigation is excellent - dustbin cleanout, not so much.', 'body': 'We just received the robot yesterday, February 3, 2023, so this is a preliminary review. Setup was straightforward as was connection to wifi and the app on my phone. My biggest concerns are with the app, not the Robot itself.  First, there are few directions within the app. Thus I had to search through the various menus and randomly press buttons in an effort to find something. Then on several occasions I found the item I wanted to find wouldn\\'t show up at all until the robot completed it\\'s first full cleaning. It\\'s a learning curve I know, but they could have helped a lot more than they did.  Then after the robot completed the first cleaning, magically, a map of the house appeared and once I got the image turned rightside up, it was simple to name the rooms. But herein lies a small issue. The app provides a list of room labels to choose from, but there appears to be no provision for customizing names. Hence, my wife\\'s sewing room became the \"Playroom.\"  I knew there was a place to set the robot\\'s suction power (Eco, Normal, Max) and after 20 minutes of re-searching, I found it. However the setting appears to apply to all the rooms to be cleaned. This is fine if you have all carpet or all smooth surfaces. Most of our floors are smooth but the master bedroom is a rather deep pile carpet.  The app allows you to name each room and send the robot off to clean all, several, or just one. This is nice. But having that capability without the ability to set the suction level for each room separately seems rather brain-dead!  That\\'s my compaints so far. Lets move on to the more positive aspects of the robot.  I mentioned, the fairly deep pile carpet in the bedroom. The robot handled it with aplomb. There was a noticeable change in speed and ease of operation but it pushed through without a whimper. I had it on normal power and would prefer \"Max,\" but will try that later.  The map it produced was remarkably good for a single cleaning run and I could easily determine which room was which, once I got it rightside up.  \" a single cleaning run\" could be misleading. Two full charges were needed to complete the cleaning. The app does provide a decent report of the robots activity. It started cleaning at 9:56 am, then briefly docked 30 min. later (orientation ??) and resumed cleaning after emptying its dust bin. The battery ran low (about 30%) after 83 minutes of cleaning time. 3 hr. and 15 min. were required for the battery to recharge. It then cleaned (with an intermediate docking) for nearly 2 hours where it died in our bathroom with 5% charge showing in the app. We carried it back to the docking station where it exhausted the debris and began recharging. 6.5 hours were required from staart to finish. This isn\\'t good, or bad, It;s just information for you.  The app says 2276 sq ft were cleaned. This is about twice too much. About 1350 sq ft (gross outside dimensions) were available, but that includes closets, furniture, bathtubs, etc that block the robot. I did notice that it systematically recleaned numerous areas on the second charge, So I don\\'t think their numbers are wrong, just duplicated.  Its ability to navigate appears to be excellent. It does travel in long, precisely straight lines when it can. Though it seems to turn around at about 20 \\', regardless. When it approaches a wall or furniture, it will slow and gently tap the barrier, or turn just before reaching the item. It typically turns corners around furniture efficiently, though there is sometimes a bit of wasted spinning around.  Except for the time where it ran out of juice, it effortlessly relocated the dock to recharge and empty the onboard dust bin.  We have a pet cat with 2\" fur, very fine fur, that sheds constantly. There is no reason that cat isn\\'t totally bald! The roller brush and side brushes seemed to handle it well. Both were relatively free of her fur. I know I will have to clean the axels and the roller every few weeks but it should be tolerable.  If I think of it, I\\'ll add to this review at a later date.  So here is an update. It\\'s now April 21, 2023 and I\\'m still very pleased with the machine. It seems to do a good job on our hard surfaced floors as it seldom misses visible debris. The degree of cleaning on our carpets is harder to know, but the dust bin always contains an abundance of cat hair. Speaking of cat hair, the roller NEVER clogs with cat hair. However, the axles on the roller do collect hair. I have to clean them every 2-3 weeks as the machine stops and says \"my roller is clogged.\" That said, the roller axles are very easy to clean. No tools are needed since the roller cover just snaps in and out and the roller then lifts out nicely exposing the axles and housings. Though a small pick is needed to clean one end of the axle.  The shark never gets caught in a corner or tight spot when there is a path out. Our Neato used to get caught frequently for no good reason. The shark has gotten caught a few times on cords, shoe laces etc, and twice has run up on the track of our patio door and gotten stuck but it is vastly better at returning to the base station than our Neato.  I have the \"Extended Clean\" option turned on which tells the Shark to continue cleaning until it needs charging. Lately it has run out of power a few times and had to be manually returned to the base station . I will try it with extended clean \"Off.\" This may cause it to take longer to clean the house but may increase reliability.  The attached photo illustrates the depth of pile in our carpet as well as the manner in which it cleans. The shark is quite systematic when cleaning but it does sometimes cover some areas twice.  We have some open grates on our floor and the Shark traverses them without issue. The Neato would stop on them and discontinue cleaning so we had to use the magnetic strips (supplied) to avoid this issue. The shark recognizes the magnetic strips, but they aren\\'t needed for the grates.  I empty the dust bin on the base station probably once every 3 weeks which works fine. That\\'s all for now.  Here\\'s another update,. It is now January 10, 2024 and the Shark has 11 months under it\\'s belt. It started doing weird things/errors after about 6 months so I replaced the battery which was needed with our Neato and it took care of our problem. It continues to perform well until it picks up a small rock or pea sized chunk of dog food, which happens frequently now that we were forced to change our little dog\\'s food for medical reasons. The shark does pick up these items but they fail to exhaust into the dustbin and lodge either in the throat of the dustbin or get stuck in the spring loaded door on the Shark. When that happens an error occurs and the shark ceases operation. This issue is simple to fix. However the most annoying thing is after clearing the blockage, the Shark doesn\\'t pickup where it left off. I have to select the rooms that were missed (very nice capability by the way) and tell it to start cleaning again.  May 14, 2024 The shark, as near as I can tell continues to function normally. However, the dustbin\\'s failure to empty and subsequent error messages that prevent the unit from continuing to clean has finally pushed me over the edge. It is rare that the entire set of rooms get vacuumed. Most days I have to restart the machine at least once during the cleaning cycle and then it \"forgets\" where to restart. The bottom line is it\\'s too frustrating to use now and it\\'s going in the trash.', 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': 298, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Grandma Linda'}}]}, 'reviewsTotal': 7479}, 'product7': {'reviewsPaginated': {'reviews': [{'title': 'BEST SELF CLEANER', 'body': \"I was a little worried, getting anything other than a shark robot vacuum, but this one was on sale, so i thought i would give it a go.

If I want it to work in a different room I can use my phone to manually drive it over to where I want, then reactivate cleaning mode. •Great price.

I don’t use mine as a replacement for vacuuming, so it struggling to pick up a Cheeto is fine for me. I have children with allergies and I have two cats, so my primary use for this device is a daily pet dander cleaner in between me vacuuming. It does a wonderful job at collecting cat hair. •Battery life. I wish it was a tad bit longer. It lasts about 40-60 min. The good news is, when it needs recharging it drives itself to the charger.

PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BUY!', 'body': \"**Update** The company did get in touch with me. They apologized about the miscommunication and sent us a new device altogether. (AT THIS POINT THE VACUUM HAD BEEN PURCHASED 9 MONTHS PRIOR). I really can't believe a company would do this. I was pleasantly surprised at the outcome. Our new device came in today and I set it up without issue. They didn't even ask us to send the defective device back to them. For this reason, I have updated my review to 5 stars. This was our first robo vacuum and honestly I don't know how anyone lives without one of these bad boys.  We have had this vacuum since Christmas. It worked great.... when it worked... I usually read reviews on all products I buy. The reviews on this product, I could deal with. The occasional getting lost or getting tangled, or not being the smartest robot.... all those things I can deal with.... but one day without warning it just starts beeping.... 6 times over and over and wouldn't move. I tried everything. I looked in the manual and the 6 beeps meant something. The battery was not getting charged properly... I checked connection, I unplugged, I cleaned, brushed, everything I could think of to do and what the manual said to do, but the battery would never connect and the robot wouldn't move. I put in a service ticket with the company, Lefant, they got back to me 2 days later wanting a video and description of what was happening. Okay fine I did that, then no response. I've checked multiple times and replied back.. all they can say when I do that is submit video... I tell them I have submitted the video and done everything they have asked for, but still nothing. My request was put in at the start of July... so this thing is only 7 months old... if you are going to sell this peice of equipment, be there for your customers when something goes wrong.

Cleans well enough and does not fall down the stairs. Using the Lefant app is almost impossible to use with Alexa. Instead, use the Smart life app. Once paired with the smart life app it will erase itself from the Lefant app and will be recognized by Alexa. From there you can transfer it to the Lefant app in order for it to be recognized by Alexa. I deleted the Lefant app and just used the smart life app being that I already have it on my phone to control my lights. One less app using up the memory and storage of my phone. The duration of the battery is an hour and a half or 90 minutes give or take 5 minutes which is good enough to clean 2 bedrooms, a den and a long hallway. There is an area rug in my den, hallway, and 1 bedroom and it managed to go over them without any problems most of the time. Whats irritating is when its done its job and needs to go back to the charging dock. It spends so much time looking for the charging dock that it runs out of power before being able to dock. It keeps passing the dock which is just 1 or 2 feet away. But here is what I noticed, when I press home on the remote and the unit is 5 feet or less away in a straight line from the charging dock, it'll never (maybe sometimes) find the dock. But if its more than 7 or 8 feet away it manages to find the charging dock. I initially place the charging dock on the short end of the hallway (middle of the hallway, around 5 feet across) while testing it and only once was it able to find the charging dock. But when I placed it in the living room, the wall where I placed the charging dock was across another wall around 20-25 feet away, it manages to find the charging dock always. Seems like it needs a long path (like a runway) to prep itself and make a bee line towards the dock. Makes me want to return this because of that but still thinking it over because I do like the color as it does not show the dust which accumulates on the top of it. I have a black one and you can see the dust which sticks to the sides of the unit as if though it has been off roading. If I were to compare this to a vacuum with a roller brush, the roller brush wins without question. I tested this the first time by running the Lefant once a day for 5 days in three rooms which have 10 x 7 area rugs and a hallway runner which is 12 feet long by 3 feet. These rugs have been manually vacuumed twice a week with a regular (the type that you pull with you) vacuum and results seem to show that the robot vacuum did a better job. I then ran a robot vacuum with a roller brush for just once for 75 minutes. The vacuum with the roller brush deep cleaned the the rugs way much better and actually vacuumed out more dust and lint than the Lefant. That was 5 days at 100 minutes per use with the Lefant vs 1 use for 75 minutes with a roller brushed robot vacuum. First dust pile is the Lefant. Second is the roller brushed vacuum. The proof says it all. Though the lefant does a good job, it could be better. Its fine I guess but compared to a Eufy 30C, i prefer the Eufy over this. More elegant, it has a roller brush which lifts the dust off the carpet though hair gets caught on the roller but its not that hard to remove. I would rather that the dust gets lifted out of the carpet than just off the surface. And the Eufy always finds its way to the chraging dock. I'm testing another unit by Acecool, seems to be the same as the Lefant M210, even the manual of the Acecool mentions the M210. Acecool has a bigger capacity battery with a running time of 170 minutes (don't know if its true but I am testing it right now, its been running for an hour and 10 minutes as I write this) and the same features. They look almost the same in size, the body structure, and dust bin. The only difference is the color and the top cover. Only thing I don't like about the Acecool is that its black and fell down the stairs when I used the edge (wall) cleaning mode. I think the wheel slipped since the sides of these units don't have side sensors. Acecool does go over the carpets much better and seems more solid compared to the Lefant. Still testing. At the moment, a 3 star rating is the best I can give the Lefant M210\", 'rating': 3, 'helpfulVotes': 259, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Rocco'}}, {'title': 'Best gift to myself ever!', 'body': 'The media could not be loaded.

I’m a mom to 4 young children living in a 1880 square foot house on a large wooded lot. My kids are outside A LOT and track in all kinds of dirt, mud, leaves, grass, etc. My husband, while I love him, is also kind of a mess and has a bad habit of not wiping his shoes and bringing in a ton of sawdust from his projects. On top of all of that, add in the fact that children under 7 really don’t know how to eat properly and drop about seven thousand crumbs per meal per child. Our floors, wood, tile, and carpet, have been a disaster for years.  Enter the Roomba. I have been eyeing this little piece of wizardry for years and wondering if this could be the tool that could change my life. I swept and vacuumed (with a Dyson DC33) multiple times a day. I was constantly telling guests, “hey sorry about the floor but I think we’re just gross and I can never get on top of it”. Well, after finally biting the bullet I regret that I didn’t buy a Roomba years ago. I don’t have to apologize to guests and I can finally walk barefoot in my house without having 100 tiny crumbs attaching to the bottom of my feet. I love this thing more than I have ever loved any appliance or cleaning tool I have every owned.  About half of our home is our 2 living areas, dining, kitchen, and mud room. The other half are 4 bedrooms and two bathrooms. I have a baby gate dividing the two halves which acts as a barrier that the Roomba can’t get through. I really like having that barrier and if I didn’t use that baby gate I probably would have gone with the 690 for the virtual wall but I don’t see a purpose for it for us. I run the Roomba every night in our living/eating/kitchen area after we pick up the toys and straighten up the house. This is like magic. I always WANT to have things picked up and put away but I didn’t always do that before the Roomba because we are TIRED. But I love running the Roomba so much that since we have owned this thing we have cleaned up every night since we have owned it. Magic. I run the Roomba in the bedroom/bathroom areas 2-3 times a week in our house. Our kids are a little afraid of it (I want them to be, I don’t want them to touch it, and I may have told them it will bite them) and it does make noise so between all of our napping and sleeping I don’t have as much time to run it back there. I don’t mind though, because the bedrooms do not get nearly as dirty as our living areas.  The things I wish I would have known before purchasing: - It really does clean all of the floor. It picks everything up. The crumbs and leaves are gone. It doesn’t miss any part of the floor. I was afraid it would kind of get half of the floor and not the other half because it isn’t as intelligent as the higher trim lines of the Roomba. I was wrong. This thing is amazing. I heard from someone else that you shouldn’t watch the Roomba because it will just drive you crazy. This is totally true. I watch it and question every move it makes. Why did it roll right past that crumb? Why is it spending 20 minutes under that couch? Just don’t watch it! It so nice to lay in bed at night, tell it to clean from my smart phone, go to sleep, and wake up in the morning to spotless floors! - I have needed to clean out the dust bin after every cleaning. I read a lot of reviews that said once you get into the swing of things with your Roomba you only need to clean out the dust bin once or twice a week. That hasn’t been true for us. I’m telling you, we are gross. So if your kids are especially messy or you have really messy pets or track in a lot from being outside that might just be your reality. But that’s fine with me because emptying the dustbin is a lot easier than vacuuming my own floors! - It charges really quickly. I thought I’d be waiting half a day for a charge. Not so. Ours charges within an hour which is nice because I like to charge in between doing both halves of my house. With as dirty as our floors get I don’t think the Roomba could do the entire 1880 square feet on one charge. - Unless you really, really want the features the higher end Roombas provide you really shouldn’t look at this vacuum as a cheap item. The technology in this thing is awesome (or at least I think it is, I’m not really super techy). This is a great robot that does an amazing job and seems very durable. - It does make noise. My mother in law commented that she was surprised it made noise. It’s a vacuum. - It has changed my life. I am excited to clean my house. I am excited to pick up toys.

It's scheduled three times a week. I have a small dog and two cats and mostly tile floors with some fairly flat area rugs. We have a house with a large yard and often grass clippings and mud come in with either the people, who don't always kick off shoes or maybe attached to the dog.  The Roomba does a decent job dealing with these challenges. Our house is noticeably cleaner between the days our cleaning person comes. There are many fewer dust bunnies, fur balls, bits of seed from our bird feeders, and grass clippings on our floors.  The Roomba gets stuck under areas of low clearance (we identified two areas that we basically block off before the cleaning time). We also pick up the various cat toys so the Roomba doesn't choke on them.  The Roomba roams for two hours+ and then usually self parks. Occasionally it gets stuck by one of our chairs that has USB cables all over. We had to move one lamp cord to keep the lamp from being pulled off a table. It's not quite like child-proofing a house, but you may need to do some Roomba-proofing.  Usually the dust basket is filled with hair from our fairly fluffy cats. It's very satisfying to empty it and realize that's been dealt with and I didn't have to do it.  On one occasion, our elderly dog released a brown trout in the dining room floor. The Roomba smeared it when it started before we woke up. Thank goodness the room is tile.  We now make sure the coast is clear before running it. Cleaning the floor was fairly simple. Removing feces from the Roomba was somewhat more involved and fairly unpleasant.  I never planned to have the Roomba replace our cleaning lady. I just wanted to tidy things up between her visits. It works for that purpose and does well.  It had a learning curve but we've adjusted. It's been reliable. I like the notices for maintenance. It usually finds its way to home base, but not always, and that's ok.  I occasionally spot clean our screened in porch and upstairs with our Roomba and it does fine. It detects and does not suicide dive off our stairs when it is upstairs.  I had iRobot products (vacuum and mop) in the past. I got away from them because I didn't think they were that great and they were a little flaky or too complex to use. I think they've gotten much better. I have not tried other robot vacuums.

I\\'ve wanted a Roomba for a long time but I\\'m glad I waited for the technology to improve. Right out of the box, I flipped it over to check out the underbelly. I found that the piece that houses the brushes was askew and not snapped properly in place. It took a couple minutes and a flat head screwdriver to pry it out and then snap it fully back in place. I\\'m only glad I didn\\'t break it. I\\'m using it in a carpeted, sunken (one step lower) family room which is also the room I enter from the garage and the room I use the most. It works well in this room. It fits underneath most of the furniture, easily transitions onto the door mat, is less noisy than a traditional vacuum and makes adorable robot noises. It has some quirks: It doesn\\'t clean in a logical pattern and seems to return to the same areas repeatedly. It particularly seems to \"like\" cleaning under furniture, but that may be because the pieces are against the wall and it pays particular attention to walls and corners. I appreciate that it cleans so well under the sofa and chairs, which wouldn\\'t otherwise happen nearly as often, but the middle of the room doesn\\'t seem to get the same attention. The good news is that with the app, you can schedule daily cleanings if you want to, so all the areas are bound to get clean. I set daily cleanings for the first few days, now just twice a week. Setting a schedule has helped me keep the room picked up and looking nice. I positioned the charging base out of sight under a small chest, and this is working out fine. It took a couple tries for it to dock itself the first time, and now it has no trouble. Be aware that you\\'ll need to \"vacuum proof\" the house. Cords are an obvious thing (mine got tangled up one day while I was at work), but it will find anything that\\'s loose, even pieces of baseboard trim. I tried out this 675 model on the rest of my house (1500 sq feet of hard floors) and I was favorably impressed. It effortlessly navigated the transitions between rooms which have slightly different floor heights. It had no problem with door mats, but couldn\\'t manage bedroom or bathroom rugs. It gets up a bit of speed in open areas and I noticed that sometimes it slows down when it approaches objects but other times it rams into them full speed. It also became \"stranded on a cliff\" when it approached a step down at full speed. It stopped before falling down but seemed to have gone too far over the edge to back up. As with my carpeted room, it focused more on the periphery than the middle areas of rooms, and it went back and forth between the kitchen and living room several times before venturing down the hallway into the bedrooms and bathroom (these rooms barely got a cleaning).

My neato was shaped like the letter D. So it was bound to get stuck a lot. This little guy is round and can work his way out of most situations.  - It picks up a TON of lint and trash off the floor. We don't have dogs but we do have 2 kids. And my husband is a mechanic that loves to ride 4 wheelers in mud. My daughter and I both have long hair that falls out everywhere. And my 1 year old son drops food like no bodys business. So my floor always needs a good vacuuming. This does the job. I can run my regular vacuum over the floors and then turn this on and it still gives me a full bin of lint and dirt.  CONS..  - The biggest drawback for me is the fact that my house is pretty open concept. It cleans pretty sporadically and does miss some areas. Next time I will be getting the roomba that you can set boundaries for. So that you can pick one room for it to clean at a time. For example my kitchen has 4 door ways (weird I know). Honestly I just need that room cleaned most the time when I turn it on but I can't block it in there because it would be nearly impossible with all the ways for it to escape. I have read that Irobot sells something for this so I'm going to look into it. But keep in mind that if your home is open concept it DOES clean pretty sporadically. I usually put it in a room and shut the door. It cleans the room and does a great job. When it's done it plays its little jingle and a notification is sent to my phone. I go and move it to another area. Kind of annoying but better than having to lug my vacuum around to do the whole house.  - As I said before, my daughter and I both have long hair and we shed a lot. So every week I am cutting hair out of all the nooks and crannies on this thing. Hair is wrapped around everything! I know it is probably wrapped around the wheels too.. as that is what happened with my neato. So I know I will eventually have to take it apart and cut hair out of all the hard to reach places such as the axels. I'm really not sure if the more expensive ones would do a better job or not.

I thought, \"Really, that\\'s it? What\\'d I miss?\" As it turns out, I missed nothing. Easy-peasy. So, I thought I\\'d just let it charge overnight and then I\\'d play with it the next day.  The next day, while working in my home office, I started the app and selected \"Vacuum Everywhere\". I heard it wake up with cheerful little beeps and start working. It really isn\\'t too loud, so between meetings I followed the sound, coffee in hand, to watch it work. I was kind of fun to watch it careening around like a drunken toddler, gently crashing into stuff and bouncing counter-clockwise until it could move again. I half-expected it to exclaim, \"Uh-oh!\" And if something was light enough, it just pushed it around until it hit something solid enough to make it bounce. I wish I\\'d waited until after working hours so that I could watch it with an adult beverage or two. The 14-year-old in me is definitely going to set up some obstacle tests.  Like any toddler, it requires a little bit of supervision. It got stuck on a thick power cable beneath a bed, so it beeped, called out with a voice to ask for help, and alerted my phone app; I rescued it and sent it on its way.

It wasn’t even a difficult spot to maneuver so she only had to move forward a little to get out of the jam, but Rosie kept spinning around trying to ram her way through a wall instead. Rosie seems to like my standing lamp, though, and humped herself right over the 2 inch base and tried climbing up the pole of the lamp. So energetic! She also managed to run over my power surge protector under the bed and turn it off. Rosie works hard. She cleaned the entire living and kitchen area once, the master bedroom numerous times for about 45 minutes, another much smaller bedroom for about 30 minutes total and skipped one bedroom altogether.

I do like Rosie’s longer-lasting battery, but she also takes 5 hours to fully charge as opposed to my last one which only took 90 minutes. Overall, she’s not bad for the money, but I haven’t decided whether or not I’m going to return her and use the money for one of better quality.', 'rating': 3, 'helpfulVotes': 2, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Cathleen Dees'}}, {'title': 'Very impressed!', 'body': 'Disclaimer: I bought this model, 675, with my own money and these are my honest opinions.  I\\'ve never owned one of these and literally bought it on a whim. I was initially looking at a cheaper Eufy brand vacuum because I trust its parent company (Anker), but once I saw that iRobot had Alexa enabled and app integrated robots I went for this one. A lot of my house consists of smart devices so it only made sense.  The Alexa integration was very simple. Just download the app, log into your wifi, and the Roomba connects very easily. Then you just have to enable the iRobot Home skill in your Alexa app. I had trouble figuring out the appropriate commands but just google search \"roomba alexa comands\" to find them. Once you set up scheduled cleaning in the iRobot app you don\\'t have to control it through Alexa very often unless you want to do multiple cleanings in a day.  I placed the dock appropriately, following spacial instructions, and charged the robot for about an hour. The instructions say 3 hours initially but I checked the app and it was fully charged. The Roomba responds very quickly to the app and it started cleaning right when I tapped \"Clean\" on the app. It moves very randomly and can seem to get stuck for a bit but it usually finds its way. I have an area rug with dark brown/black sections that I wasn\\'t worried about but it will not pass over them because it assumes they\\'re \"cliffs.\" I\\'m grateful for the \"cliff protection\" feature and can live with this hiccup, just beware if you have black rugs. I have others that are solid chocolate brown and it passes over those just fine.  I was frustrated that it wouldn\\'t return to base the first couple times, but that\\'s because I moved it manually because it couldn\\'t find its way out from under my dining table and I was inpatient. IF YOU MOVE IT DURING CLEANING IT CAN\\'T FIND THE BASE. It will only find its way back to the dock it it starts there and is left uninterrupted. Occasionally it will actually get stuck and it will turn off and chime some tones to get your attention. You also get a notification on your phone to go help it. The only times it\\'s gotten really stuck was on the edge of a really high pile shag rug (which is warned against in the instructions) and when it wedged under a headboard that was just the perfect height to pin it to the ground.  Some have said it sucks up cords but I keep my cords/electronics VERY tidy so its not an issue for me. Emptying the bin is very easy, and it filled up really quickly the first few runs, which is expected. Its kind of gross how much it captures in my house because I keep it very clean as it is. It was able to pick up standard clay cat litter fairly well. Toward the end of its cleaning cycle when the bin and filter were more obstructed it didn\\'t always capture the litter though, which is what you\\'d expect. It did bump into my cats\\' food and water bowls and push them around a bit. It worries me a little that water may spill if I\\'m not there to monitor it. I\\'ve ordered a \"iRobot Dual Mode Virtual Wall Barrier (Renewed)\" that i\\'ll put in \"Lighthouse\" mode to fix that (the renewed model is half the price of a new one so I\\'m giving it a shot. it has a 90 day amazon guarantee).  Overall I love this thing and it\\'s only been 2 days. It\\'s very convenient to be able to schedule cleaning when your away at work, or if you are expecting company and have other things to prepare. I think my Roomba will continue to serve me well. If any glaring issues come up I\\'ll update this review as needed.  UPDATE 9/19/19 I still love the thing. I ordered some white felt tape and put that over the black borders of my trouble rug under my couches so it seamlessly travels over those areas. I also ordered 8 2\" risers for my couch and loveseat because they were just barely too low for the roomba. The iRobot virtual walls (Renewed) are a life saver. I have 3 of them now, one to protect the cat food bowls, one to block off the dining room (it gets caught in the chair legs forever and would rather it spend time in other areas), and one to block off a room with a high pile shag rug.  I\\'ve officially \"roomba-proofed\" my house and I have it clean everyday while I\\'m at work and I havent gotten a \"Roomba is stuck\" notification since.

I don't need all the extras, I've been very happy with the basic features offered by cheap models. I had to order a new one due to the consistent Error 14 that finally stopped my old one from working no matter how much I cleaned connections. That error is caused by the poor connection between the battery and the vacuum motor which was part of the dirt bin (separate from the main robot) and had to be totally removed to empty. Placing the motor on the removable dirt bin was not the best engineering. The great news is my new Q0120 vacuum motor is part of the main Roomba and not the dirt bin so that issue is completely solved. Additional positives include the dirt bin having much more capacity and there is only one roller to replace and not two. The Bluetooth iPhone interface is pretty cool - I always hated looking for my Roomba when it completed the job and now I can ask it to make a noise to locate it. I can also remotely start and stop it using the interface (iRobot app on iPhone). And if it stops or needs help it sends my phone a message. Overall I really like this model and mechanically it is a great improvement over the past two I've had. I do have one subjective concern: it's seems like it's a little dumber than the past two. In addition to getting hung up in the same places they did, it seems more confused by corners and walls with tables and multiple obstructions. In the past, it would take about 40-50 minutes to complete our kitchen/livingroom level of the house. Now I find it continuously hung up around certain small areas that contain furniture, walls and corners - it will spend 10 minutes going over the same spot until I get annoyed and move it. It took it two hours to complete the kitchen/livingroom and it still missed some spots. I'm hoping this may improve - maybe it has learning algorithms? Also it must have a slightly higher profile than older models as it is getting hard-stuck under furniture edges that the old ones could clear. I was also disappointed to find the old Virtual Wall doesn't work with new models and I will have to purchase a new one if I want to keep using that feature, but I get the need to update it and the related features. Overall I am quite happy with this new Roomba. Not having to clean power connections every use is HUGE. I would recommend it at this point.

Over the last couple of years, I've known people who have had Roombas and they've been very happy with them. I had been looking to buy one for quite some time, but I wanted to wait until I found one that was affordably priced (IMO) while still having some more advanced technology, not too basic. The one I got was the 600 series (the Roomba 675), which works with Wi-Fi and has an app that you can download, whether you have an iPhone or a Droid. For some reason I was under the impression that it would work with Alexa, but it seems I was mistaken.  It came in a very sturdy box and included a spare filter, a page with quick setup instructions, and a thankfully short owner's manual in the usual 3 languages, English (I noticed a few typos LOL), French, and Spanish.  I was able to set it up very quickly, basically putting the dock on the floor near an outlet, plugging it in, and putting The Bot in the dock. It started charging immediately, although the owner's manual says that it already comes charged and could work right away. Anyway, while it sat in the dock charging, I downloaded the app and went through setting up the Wi-Fi, also a snap. The first time I ran it on my tile floors downstairs, it was because I accidentally pushed the button in the app LOL. It found its way around my front room, bumping gently into this and that, not hard enough to damage any of the moldings, paint, furniture, etc. At some point it decided to go back to the dock, probably to charge, and it docked perfectly and started charging. The second time I sent it for another run, I kind of had to encourage it to go into the other room, which it did. After about 15 minutes I ordered it to go back to its dock through the app. It took a little while for it to find its way back to the other room and dock, but again, it went back and docked itself perfectly.  The first time it encountered a floor mat by my front door, it backed off, but the second time, it went onto the mat and vacuumed it (yay!) In my kitchen, I have a very ergonomic and cushioned rubber mat near the sink. It had no problem climbing up onto that and vacuuming that (yay!)  The owner's manual has excellent information with diagrams, all of the parts being labeled, troubleshooting issues, and maintenance instructions. Regarding maintenance, it recommends emptying the bin after each use, cleaning the filter and brushes once a week, cleaning the front caster wheel every 2 weeks, and cleaning the side brush, the cliff sensors, and the charging contacts once a month. I do plan to empty the bin after each use (more on that later), but the rest seems kind of excessive to me, since I'm the only human in the house and I have no pets. I really only plan to use this maybe once a week upstairs and downstairs. I can eyeball the parts and see if they need to be cleaned periodically.  Regarding maintenance of the various parts, in terms of replacing them, they recommend replacing the filter every 2 months, the brushes every 6 to 12 months, and the front caster wheel every 12 months (not sure why). This also seems kind of frequent to me, so again, I will just monitor their conditions and change them when I feel it's necessary. They have diagrams for how to clean and change all the various parts.  One of my friends had a Roomba that was so loud it would scare the bejesus out of you if it started up and you weren't expecting it. I would say that mine does not seem to be that loud.  To my surprise, when I emptied the dustbin, which was very easy, there was a lot of dirt, hair, and dust. So I'm very satisfied. I did follow The Bot around here and there, and watched it pick up things off the floor. I didn't see it leave anything obvious behind, and certainly my floors are cleaner than they were before.  I couldn't find any specs, so I took measurements myself (although I guess you can probably find them online). The Bot is about 13 inches in diameter and seems to be not even 3 inches high. It had no problem going under most of my furniture, which I'm really happy about because there's always dust under there. Little update: I took The Bot upstairs, and let him cruise around for a while. It's a mix of carpet and tile. There was a good amount of dust and dirt accumulated in the bin. He did a great job going under the bed, vacuuming various floor mats, navigating door sills, etc. So far so good.  All in all, caveat being that this is only the first day, I'm very satisfied with it, and I hope it has a very long, healthy, productive life here!\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 82, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Sherry Roth'}}]}, 'reviewsTotal': 7637}, 'product10': {'reviewsPaginated': {'reviews': [{'title': 'Outstanding Performance and Features!', 'body': 'I am thoroughly impressed with this Robot Vacuum Cleaner!

I do have another robot that is LIDAR so I can give a rough pros and cons of the two type of navigation system.  Roomba relies more on bumping into things and it\\'s map to navigate. There\\'s good and bad. The bad is that it will often go around the house as if it\\'s a drunk bumping into furniture and objects. The robot needs to learn your floorplan and that can take a long time since it\\'s bumping into everything. It took me about 5 runs of my whole house. Each run took about 3 -4 hours since my house is 2500 sq ft. Prior to it learning my house, it\\'s navigation looked like it was non existent. I thought I had just bought the dumbest robot especially compared to my inexpensive $300 LIDAR robot. However, once the robot declared that it had learned my floorplan everything changed and I began to see the benefits of the iRobot navigation system.  Even after learning my floorplan, the iRobot still takes forever navigating around table and chair legs. Bumping and taking multiple attempts to escape the forest of chair legs, but surprisingly, it has never gotten stuck in my house. I have set it to vacuum my entire house several times and in total it has vacuumed about 20,000 sq ft in it\\'s lifetime so far and it has never gotten stuck. We have kids so there\\'s a lot of toys and miscellaneous items everywhere so that\\'s amazing to me.  My LIDAR robot on the other hand navigates beautifully around furniture but it can\\'t see cords or other lower to the ground objects and it constantly gets stuck on these objects. Also because LIDAR isn\\'t bumping into things to navigate it gets stuck under my couch because the fabric under my couch sags and the LIDAR robot will travel underneath the couch but then think it\\'s blocked in by the fabric when it tries to leave the couch area. The iRobot doesn\\'t have this problems because whenever it\\'s in doubt it just goes barreling through and utilizes the bump sensor to feel around.  The other problem with my $300 LIDAR unit was that it would sometimes do a cleaning run but mistakenly think that there is a new floorplan and erase the old one. It\\'s more sensitive to changes because it\\'s LIDAR hardware can detect small changes. This is probably more a software issue. The iRobot on the other hand, is very hesitant to change it\\'s map. That is good in that it has never erased my current floorplan or made incorrect modifications, however, the initial \"learning of the floorplan\" is a bit harder if it doesn\\'t discover all your rooms. Getting it to discover new rooms is more difficult since the floor plan is locked in. I\\'ve found the best way to get it to discover new rooms after it has \"learned the floorplan\" is to do an area clean and just draw a box where to new room should be. Once I did that, it would explore that area and declare it found a new space and then it was added to the floorplan.  A few other more minor issues is that the Roomba software is polished but also very limited on options as compared to my inexpensive LIDAR unit. For example, I can\\'t set how often the Roomba should self empty or the quiet times (they removed the beta feature for quiet times). These are important features since the self empty dock is very loud. Much louder then my LIDAR robots self empty dock. I\\'m not that sensitive to noise. The noise level is just a design flaw. I can\\'t imagine going forward they will keep this design. If you live in a small apartment then you should definitely be aware that you will be disturbing your neighbors or yourself when it self empties.

I love it I love it I love it. One major issue for me was that it was a pain in the butt to carry the base around in a multilevel home. After rereading the instruction manual I discovered that I’m not supposed to do that, that you can just carry the machine around and place it. As long as it does not have to empty the bin or recharge, it does not necessarily have to begin and end on the charging base. Ok so this has made my life so much easier. I did have to update my maps several times to teach it not to expect the base when it was done, and it has since behaved perfectly well. (The first few times it wandered around for a long time and the program said “searching for base” and I felt sorry for it 🤣. I didn’t want to delete my map that had the base on it and start over because I had to teach it to stay off of a shaggy rug and that took a lot of tweaking). I also have stopped being stingy with use and have given in and am carrying it around and running it more often and sometimes going over areas twice to get all the cat litter, and my house stays so clean. That means I will have to change the filters and rollers more often but oh well!  UPDATE: It has now been another month or so. I like the machine more and more and am changing the review to 5 stars. I have continued to tweak the programs I have set up on the app, and its performance improves. Since we have a cat, a major issue is the cat litter which she manages to drag all over. The machine sometimes will miss some litter in certain areas, and since we have dark floors it shows up brightly and drives me nuts. I can tell the robot to go over certain areas twice and that solves that problem. (Honestly the cleaners we hired would sometimes miss just as much if not more because the tiny specks get ground into the carpet). Another thing is that on our smooth wooden floors, the edge sweeping brush sometimes seems to scatter small particles around rather than pushing them into the rollers, and I have to have it go twice in places for that reason too. But with these tweaks it has been doing a really good job!! The suction is very good and the machine is surprisingly quiet. Also I am getting used to it and learning to leave it alone and not follow it around, so I’m much more relaxed about it. Another good thing—in the app the machine will tell you when it needs maintenance. There is a countdown to when I will need to change the filter and rollers, and I see that I will not need to change them nearly as often as I thought! The manual says filter every 2 month and rollers every 6 months, but according to my runtime it is going to be about double that, so I’ve got that going for me, which is nice 😉.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: I do like this little machine. I hate and I mean HATE vacuuming and my husband has a bad neck and can’t vacuum. We had hired a cleaning service but it made the cat go crazy and just became much more stressful than it was worth. So we decided to get this realizing it would pay for itself (in the absence of the cleaning service) after a few months.  You need to pick up all your things and allow it to make mapping runs when you first get started. The interface is an app on the iPad and it is very straightforward to operate, and you can make detailed programs and constantly tweak them based on the machine’s performance. The suction power and ability to pick stuff up—including cat hair and cat litter—is excellent. It is not very loud. The cat is not bothered by it, and EVERYTHING bothers her, so I am kind of amazed by that. I love that it goes back to its base and empties itself when its little bin is full.  I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 for a couple reasons. It is godawful expensive. I have learned that the replacement rollers and filters are kind of expensive and have to be changed very regularly. Also—and I admit a lot of this is my issue due to OCD—so far I feel like I have to babysit it and be aware of where it is and what it’s doing, which defeats some of the purpose of getting the machine to do the work in the first place. I am hoping this will improve in time since I have tweaked some of the programs and the machine is learning, and I just need to get used to it. Some of this is due to the fact that I have a multilevel home and have to carry the base around and then tell it to go, rather than just setting programs and ignoring it, which can’t be helped. It would be much better in a single level.  All in all it’s really good, and has the potential to be great, but time will tell. We will see if the rollers and filters have to be changed as often as it says. Probably the filters do, because of my cat, but maybe the rollers can last a little longer.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 266, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Sarah'}}, {'title': 'A neat concept but way too many issues and poor customer service.', 'body': 'I purchased the J7+ in November of 2021, which was approximately two months after the initial release.

I took the bag out and realigned and wiped the sensors but still got the same issue... I was able to force the Roomba to empty into the base through the app but it would not do so itself. I even bought third parry bags and IRobot branded bags and neither fixed the issue.  In the mean time the Roomba operated well enough. I had to manually empty the bin but that wasnt too bad. I say that it worked well enough though, as I bought the J7+ as it says it is specifically designed to go around pet waste and other objects, yet it was constantly vacuuming up my puppies waste, as well as sucking up the puppy training pad, which would cause the Roomba to beep until I manually removed the training pad from the wheels.  I would have bought a less expensive, tried and true model, had I known the pet waste detection was not working well on this Roomba (even though that was what it said it was designed for).  On many occasions the Roomba would run out of charge and die before it finished cleaning and before it could return itself to the charging base, most often under the bed, so I\\'d have to crawl under the bed to retrieve the Roomba and manually place on the charger. Not the worst problem in the world but for $800+ I did not expect to have this issue.  I called and spoke with an IRobot customer service agent was from a call center and while the agent was pleasant enough and walked me through some troubleshoot steps, of course the agent could not resolve any of the issue and ultimately just had me do a fairly detailed cleaning of the Roomba, but not much more. The agent did not once mention that the Roomba was under warranty and that I could possibly get it repaired under warranty.  I suffered through another year of issues with the Roomba, mainly manually emptying, not charging, not returning to the base (to charge), not being able to connect, issues with it getting stuck under objects or sucking up objects it should have avoided etc.  The rare time the base worked, it was extremely loud when emptying from the Roomba to the base, which might be worse than manually needing to empty the Roomba ever few days.  Finally, the Roomba completely stopped charging and connecting altogether. I again did a troubleshoot session with no fix and no offer for the parts to be replaced/Roomba to be repaired under warranty.  I ended up unplugging the Roomba and and left it in a closet to die. I of course finally was motivated to try the Roomba again after 3 months of it being unplugged, just to see if it magically repaired itself and of course, now I have a new issue with it stating that it is on uneven ground and it cannot run until it is placed on even ground (even though it is).  I again called the customer service line and spoke to a very pleasant 12 year old (or at least they sounded like they were 12) and the agent perfectly followed the pre-written script they had and walked me through a very detailed cleaning process, which of course did nothing to solve the issue/s.  This agent then asked for my receipt and mentioned repairs under warranty, only to of course say the warranty was now expired, but for \"Maybe\" around $150 I could purchase an extended warranty and send the Roomba in for repairs.  I was told that I could also take the Roomba apart myself and replace the wheels, which \"hopefully, maybe\" might be the issue and resolve the latest problems. I was told I could buy the wheels for $65 but \"maybe\" I could get a discount but that I\\'d need to talk to the sales department for that...  When I mentioned that the uneven ground error was the latest issue, but that I have had at least a dozen other issues/errors prior, the agent said that I could return the wheels should they not fix the issue and then I could trade in my J7+ for a $100 IRobot credit and could buy a new Roomba....  Talk about depreciation, I bought the J7+ brand new (two months after the release) for $879 and now a year and a half later, the Roomba is worth $100 (but only as a trade-in towards another Roomba)..  IRobot customer service did nothing to assist me and avoided mentioning repairs while the warranty was still valid, but then all of a sudden once the warranty was expired, they mention the expired warranty and pushed for me to purchase an extended warranty or a new Roomba....  Once again, I am left with a neat looking pile of plastic which does not work...  I will not be back to IRobot ever again, and recommend looking at Eufy or some of the newer Robot vacuums.

Purchased the J7+ that includes the robot and the waste station. I do like it. It is not perfect but after a couple of days of use, I am impressed. There is a learning period for both myself and the robot. 1) First off, after unboxing, put the station in and put the robot into position to charge for a few hours. While charging download the app to your phone and connect. Read the user manual about how the ring light on the robot works. It is context based - charging, vacuuming, etc. - and means different things based on the context. 2)The light on the waste station is peculiar and does not stay on when plugged in and charging. Nor does the light on the robot stay on when charging. There is a momentary initial light on each. 3) I should have read up on from their support website about Smartmaps first. After a full charge, I let the robot run through the first floor of my home. On the initial pass, It was able to do about 2.5 rooms before it needed to be recharged. While recharging, I mistakenly cancelled the initial full floor job. It worked out OK after the second full floor job - completing the first map and a new second map at the same time. Be prepared to walk around with your robot to train it where not to go. I was able to use the pause button on the phone and the top button on the robot. However, it may be better to hit the sense bars on the robot to initially avoid areas while you create the first couple maps. Subsequently, I plan to mark out the no-go zones. 4) Apparently, the position of the charge station is very important. You may want to plan this out in advance even before buying. The station needs to be near an outlet and have a clearance on each side of 1.5 feet, more distance is required if near a stairway. I am not sure how this effects your first maps if you move your station to another location on the same floor. iRobot advises getting a second waste station if you move your robot between two floors - one station for each floor. Clearly, the station position is important for the robot to know. 5) Preparation of your home for the robot can be important before using it. Pet food bowls, electrical cords, and floor mats are some of the things to consider. I found the robot had problems with a raised fireplace hearth. It was low enough to try to go on top of it but had trouble negotiating while trying to vaccuum along the edge. The fire place hearth is one area I plan on giving a no-go zone to, as well as the pet food bowls. Because preparation is needed, I am not sure how useful scheduling is going to be, unless you have a sparse home with no pets and little moveable furniture. 6) Maintenance - While on the first job ever, the vaccuum managed to wrap a cat play string around the rotating brush. I had to stop the robot and unwrap the string. (note to self - pick up all string) There was also cat hair around the rotating brush in the in joints of roller shafts that also needed clearing. I can see how maintenance is going to be a recurring thing with the robot, when you usually ignore your upright vaccums, but for emptying its bag and cleaning filters. Maintenance costs are going to be more than your upright vacuum, which you may want to consider with the upfront purchase costs. 7) Cleaner home? With hair shedding pets, I can see how one's home may remain cleaner if you regularly run the robot. The robot can also run under some things (some couches, some cabinets) where you cannot vacuum with an upright. However, there are likely to still be some areas/rooms where you don't want to run the vacuum robot - areas near food bowls, cat litter boxes, and bathrooms. 8) With a camera on the front of the robot, I think there is much that the irobot can do in programming it to clean better and navigate better. 9) I have much to learn about using the robot due to my inexperience. However, I think I can make this work to keep my home cleaner.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 193, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Lie2me'}}, {'title': 'Great product! Worked very well', 'body': 'The media could not be loaded. This little bot is a game changer. First of all I hate vacuuming and it’s just too much work to vacuum every single week. Eventually I caved in and bought this on prime day! For starters, setting up the Roomba took around 5 minutes. After letting it charge, I let it map (around an hour) my house and was surprised to see it’s very accurate. It allowed me to divided the rooms and edit keep out zones/clean zones. After setting up the map, you can now clean by room. The connectivity of the Roomba was also responsive and quick to react when I told it to clean. The Roomba j7+ also has a lot of features that I haven’t seen on my other robot vacuum cleaners. For example, it has really good obstacle detection. It can avoid dog waste, cords, shoes, etc without struggling comparing to the Roborock Q Revo. Another feature that the Roomba j7+ has, is a self emptying station. Although it’s a bit loud, I run this when I’m usually not home so it’s not a big deal. It’s also very convenient and adds to the automation of a robotic vacuum cleaner. This also knows when its bin is full, so the dustbin size won’t matter. (Shown on the picture above) Due to this, it can self empty and knows when a specific room is dirty. Although Roombas are known to have weak suction, it more then makes it up with its patented dual rubber roller brushes. It’s proven to me that it doesn’t need a lot of suction to clean good. It also adds to the benefit that it’s very quiet compare to upright vacuums which are very loud . The size of the roomba is also fairly small compare to other robot vacuums with a top mounted lidar. Overall, the value that your getting is incredible. It works well and avoids obstacles. It also has a lot of patented technology that other manufacturers doesn’t have. In conclusion, this was an awesome buy and will continue buying further robot vacuum cleaners released by iRobot in the upcoming future. 👍😄', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 4, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Sophie L'}}, {'title': 'Working flawlessly so far.

One of them died and I replaced it with the j7+. The j7+ does a better job of picking up, it mapped the house very quickly, has NEVER gotten stuck under the couch or on a rug. Has always returned to charging base and docked itself successfully. (My old roomba routinely wedged itself under furniture & didn’t have the power to pull itself back onto the charging base and would run its battery dead trying to redock). I love the large dust bin with a bag that traps the dirt. We have 4 dogs in the house and the old sweeper did not have a large bin and some days I had to empty the bin more than once for the sweeper to get the job done…with dust and hair floofing up out of the trash and into the air everytime I emptied the bin.

Review sites adore this J7+ but I don\\'t get it. We\\'ve had connectivity and setup issues with it, the app is a tick above mediocre and we don\\'t like it requiring cloud storage of photos it takes in your home to get its reviewed performance.  Here are the numbers (higher is better) of the latest runs after it has had over a week to map out the house:  Noise: 5 Battery Life: 9 Avoids Getting Stuck: 7 Brush Maintenance: 10 Self Emptying: 10 Smarts: 3 (if you don\\'t care about pet poop that is, higher if you do) Cleaning Efficiency: 3 Edge / Corner Cleaning: 2 Finds Home / Self Charges: 7 Obstacle Avoidance: 5 (does avoid obstacles but is overly cautious)  This robot is really blind and inefficient. It is constantly stopping short of where it should clean, only to turn around and then come back and revisit the same place over and over again. It bumps into objects hard which is antiquated at this stage of robot vacuum evolution.  I\\'ve watched this Roomba J7+ attempt to clean areas it has mapped out and it attempts to row clean areas from memory but the control systems for the wheel motors aren\\'t super precise for any of these floor robots. As a result, it will clean at an angle with respect to a toe kick / wall / edge where it should be driving parallel to it. This results in it having to have to re-clean the same areas more than once.  The room mapping would be far more useful if you could set priorities for the rooms. For instance, the kitchen and hallways are more important, in our case, than the bedrooms, but the J7+ often cleans the bedrooms before more important areas.  I think this is a decent robot for people that aren\\'t home when the robot is cleaning. The brushes don\\'t appear to require any maintenance, it\\'s pretty good at finding its base and the self-emptying works well. Our base is near a gate-leg dining table and it gives this robot all kinds of trouble. It has a very hard time with the mine field of table and chair legs.  Unfortunately, with a lot of people working at home, this one falls short in that scenario. It does have a good run time but it\\'s on the noisy side and is so inefficient in how it covers the floor area, that it runs and makes noise far longer than it should have to.  For reference, our $300 Costco Neato was quieter and far more efficient in its cleaning patterns. It was also better at edge and corner cleaning. The review sites state that the roomba has better suction than older bots but we didn\\'t notice any difference in cleaning. In the end, none of them are going to deep clean carpets like an upright and they all seem to clean hard floors well in our experience.  Our Neato lasted maybe 6 years or so and then began intermittently failing with \"my vision is blocked\". This evidently is due to the lidar motor / belt system wearing out so this is a vulnerability the roomba doesn\\'t have. That said, having a robot that can see makes it so much more efficient in how it traverses the house, I can deal with replacing it every 6 years.  We really dislike watching and listening to the Roomba j7+ bump into everything (and hard) after having the Neato with lidar where it can actually see where it\\'s going.  Although use of a camera based, machine learning, convolutional neural network to see where it\\'s going does seem like the inevitable future of these robots (as it\\'s a big part of self-driving car tech), the Roomba J7+ evidently has a very weak system (camera, computational, ML model, etc). I think I can objectively say it uses its camera system for obstacle avoidance only and not navigation. The obstacle avoidance is overly cautious and causes the robot to miss areas it needs to clean.', 'rating': 2, 'helpfulVotes': 11, 'reviewer': {'name': 'CA Woodworker'}}, {'title': 'Good But Some Glitches', 'body': \"I got this J7 plus on sale for $599 so for what I paid it's a really decent vacuum. I've owned a lot of iRobot Roombas for the past 20 years so I consider myself sort of an expert. Also keep in mind I do not hand out 5 star reviews lightly. This one gets 3 stars because I had some issues with the app, and getting it set up. I also can not use the function where you look at the photos with my iphone 11 pro max. I was finally able to do the set up using my OLD ipad air 2. I find it unacceptable that the app will not work for one of the main features or to set it up, using my newish Iphone on the latest iOS software. In talking to other users this problem is common. Had I not had the old iPad I would have had to return it because without connecting it to wifi via the app, it's worthless. Once I got it set up, I can do the schedule etc from my iphone but it won't show me the photos for the obstacles it finds. I get the error message on my phone but if I open the app on my iPad I can see the photos and deal with them. I do not like that I have to go get out an old device to do it and do not understand why iRobot does not deal with it. I also tried to contact them about it and got no response. I might end up just turning off the feature because it's not that big a deal to me. I did try turning it off and was hoping it would shut that light off but the light still is shining even with the feature turned off. It seems like it would waste power having that light on all the time and if I don't use the feature why is the light still on?  Ok so on to the actual vacuuming. This model does an great job on hard surfaces but does not really do the greatest job on carpet compared to my older 980 which had a carpet boost setting that most of the other 900 robots lacked. I also liked that I could set my 980 to focus on cleaning and could turn off edge clean. It's probably silly on my part but I like to see the neat lines on my carpet after it cleans and it seems to do the back and forth cleaning with the j7 and then go around the edges so I see these deep marks on the edges and going around any furniture. I liked that I could turn that off with my 980 so I just saw neat rows. I could always go turn it on once in awhile but honestly that edge feature is more important with hard floors, than it is with carpet.  One other thing I find odd is that the app shows me carpet the robot has detected, yet there are no settings for changing vac power level and it does not act differently on carpet, so why is the thing worried about detecting my carpet?  I ended up having to set it to clean twice once one way and once across what it vacuumed to get it as clean as it got it with my 980 alone. I probably would have been better off going with the s9 for carpet but I did not want to pay that much and upstairs there is not as much dirt so it does and acceptable job. I just think they could have given it a little more power and more settings. on vac power.  I love that I can set it to do certain rooms, and no longer need those dumb walls. In that respect it's so much better than my 980.  One other thing it seemed my 980 did better with was area rugs in the bathroom. My 980 used to knock them around a bit but did not get stuck on them. The j7 gets hung up on the little cotton rugs on the floor. I'm not sure how I'm going to deal with that. I want it to clean our bathrooms but it's a pain to have to pick up the rugs each day so for now I turned off the bathroom cleaning.  The self emptying feature is great. I do not have to empty the bin and once I do have to empty the bag it seals and goes in the trash without me having to get a puff of dust all over. I also love that they lowered the height with this self emptying bin so it's not a huge tower. I've been running it 3 times a week upstairs for over a month and have not had to empty it yet. I'm thinking I might just change it at 2 months if it does not give me a notice that it's full. I can feel stuff in there but I guess there is room for more. I'm not sure what has to be in there to trigger it needing to be changed. The bags to me seem reasonable. Even the irobot bags are only around $5 a bag which seems reasonable considering I'm not having to change it often, and it's worth it for me to not have to deal with the dirty dust puff all over my cleaned area. It makes me want to upgrade my s9 to the self empying base and I might do it at some point if they lower the height of that self emptying base too.  Over all this is a decent robotic vac. It's great if you have hard floors but with carpet it's just so so. I'd prefer a deeper vac power for carpet, but it's passable.

I know myself well enough to admit I would benefit from one that self empties, for a while at least. (For reference I have one child and one small dog in my household.)  The vacuum seems to be very well built and designed. Same goes for the base. I am impressed by the vacuum\\'s ability to traverse various flooring scenarios as well as it\\'s capability to pick up debris. It cleans remarkably well on hard floors, but carpet is a mixed bag. We have a Persian area rug, various shaggy bathmats and runners, as well as some wall to wall carpeting. Pet fur tends to stay pretty well velcroed to the Persian rug until I break out the upright vac. To be fair, we have another rug with tassel edges, and it amazes me that they have caused zero issues thus far.  Some notes:  It may self empty for 60 days for you, IF you live in a NASA white room. Otherwise, expect notification of \"approaching capacity\" within a week or two if you have pets, children, or just generally live in reality. Not a deal breaker, but don\\'t glaze over promises of \"up to...\"  If this vacuum picks a fight with a high-pile or shag rug, expect the vacuum to become disabled, lost, or confused, and be prepared for your rug to take significant damage. Granted, most of our bathmats are of the pretty economical variety, but be warned. They are fraying rapidly at the edges where they were in pristine condition previously.  Also- I do not feel that this is adequately addressed in any advertisement, question or review so I will state it as clearly as I can: when the vacuum self empties, the base is LOUD AF. I have read it described in many delicate and generous manners, but it only sounds and EXACTLY SOUNDS like one thing: someone running the average shop vac for 4-6 seconds. Fortunately our base station could not physically be any farther from our bedrooms and still be in the house. This was not a result of the noise, just preference, but it still helps a great deal. I wouldn\\'t call it a deal breaker, and the feature certainly seems to work very well, but you should be completely aware.  I also don\\'t love the size or proprietary nature of the waste bags. They seem to hold a fair amount, do a fair job of filtering during empties, and are certainly easy to remove and install. But it would be nice if the manufacturer would accommodate recycling the bags at least once or twice by offering some intuitive method of opening or disassembly. I\\'ve been using some long forceps to fish the larger eggs/pellets of fur out of the filter bag now and then to prolong the life of the bags, but frankly it\\'s tricky. The refills are pretty affordable, but still...  With regards to obstacle avoidance, it\\'s what you\\'d expect. You really ought to follow it around and supervise on it\\'s first vacuuming run, because there are just some things it avoids, and others it simply steamrolls. You won\\'t know if it can avoid your charging cables and shoelaces etc until you try.  As for the software, it\\'s pretty impressive but still needs a little love. I set the vac up, and sent it for a mapping run a few times. I picked up some trash cans and hampers and such to give it a broad picture of the physical furniture. I was surprised and intrigued at it\\'s accuracy and thoroughness. Then I realized two bedroom doors had been closed. I ran another DOZEN mapping runs, specifically \"updating the existing map,\" and even after finding and searching both rooms several times, the app refused to add them. Finally I decided to shake things up, so on the last mapping run, I moved the dock before the vac returned. Whoa buddy was that hilarious to watch. It did finally manage to find home, and on the next mapping run it was entirely discombobulated for the first few minutes... then it seemed to realize where it was... then it rescanned the two missed rooms again... then it returned to it\\'s dock without too much consternation... THEN it recognized both new rooms with no issue.  The ability to label rooms, define borders, create sub-zones, schedule jobs, and so forth are all pretty cool features. I use my Google ecosystem to send it to specific areas regularly and it\\'s pretty reliable.  I\\'ve seen it \"get stuck\" in a mess of dining room chairs that it\\'s explored a dozen times before. I\\'ve seen it take the alternate \"long way around\" when a baby gate was closed. I\\'ve seen it aimlessly banging against a corner it has turned many times flawlessly. I have also noticed that when it \"fails\" on a job, it seems to sit and pout, then spitefully run the battery down to nearly dead until I cradle it in my arms and gently nestle it back in the dock. It confuses me why I can\\'t just set it near the dock and tap the top button to let it know everything is hunky dory and it can return home. I say this because when manually docking this bad boy, it *is* just a little quirky and you *do* have to make a concerted effort to confirm that the contacts are indeed making positive connection.

My dogs have a little water spillage by their bowl so hair sometimes sticks from the roller into those spots but its a small space and doesn’t bother me. I usually do a whole house pick up before I start it anyways.  Because of the immense amount of hair this thing picks up, I empty it weekly. Again, not a big deal to me.  PROS:  Literally everything. It does a really good job at mapping my house. It gets in corners shockingly well. Its not perfect but if it misses a spot, you can send it on a “spot clean.” This model doesnt have lots of bells and whistles. No mopping feature, not super silent. However, that usually means it does one thing very well and that is vacuum. Thats all I wanted. Something to pick up dog hair and dirt from dogs and husband. While its not dead silent, its way quieter than my giant Shark pet hair vacuum. I also don’t need something totally quiet. A baby can definitely sleep through it. Its more like white noise to me. And you can adjust the volume of the base from the app. No dog hair has gotten stuck in the rollers but if you find Sharky is leaving behind clumps of hair, you probably need to empty out the base.  Note: I have only hardwood and tile flooring. It goes over the mat by the door very well thus far but keep in mind I have no real say in if this is great for a mostly carpeted home.

I could give two hoots about whether it has a \"map\" at this point, just clean the doggone floor -- do the basic thing you claim to be able to do and do it well. Is that so hard?  I\\'m guessing they don\\'t care given they can\\'t seem to do simple things like when I log into their website with exactly the same credentials I use in the app, it doesn\\'t show my registered products, or when I scan the QR code in the app to store the Model and S/N it can\\'t store it for more than about 5 minutes before it literally just disappears. If you can\\'t do simple things, complex ones are probably out of reach.  The system has some kind of serious software bug in it related to map storage. I work for a software company, and all the signs are present that there is a significant problem with the storage system for maps and/or the communication between the app and the robot relating to the map. I say this because our robot just lost its map one day about a month ago. No errors, no problems running, it just literally disappeared. The schedule continued to run, so I didn\\'t notice it until I looked at the cleaning notification one day and noticed that it was reporting a run time of almost 2 hours (which sounded about right) but a 0 ft squared cleaned. It sure made a lot of noise and picked up a lot of dirt for not cleaning any square footage of my first floor! When I dug into the app, the map was gone. Just not there. When going into settings to look at the map, I just get the infuriating purple spinner. No messages, no indicators of a problem, just a total lack of communication about what is going on and no map.  So I set about the task of trying to correct the problem. First, I delete the map and go to try and re-explore. It seems to delete, and it will run an exploration run, but then it just sits with that obnoxious purple spinner and the question about whether the map represents the home properly or should it re-explore, with the Accept button greyed out and NO OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE. I\\'ve re-explored 20 times and left it sitting on that screen overnight for 8 hours with it never finishing. Ever. And this is why it\\'s about to become trash!!! Without running the explore successfully, you can\\'t set the schedule! You can\\'t run a manual cleaning run with the app! If I wanted a vacuum I had to physically go push the button on, I could have bought something a heck of a lot less expensive (which is what I\\'m likely to do at this point).  SO then I thought, like most technology of this sort, it might just need a complete fresh start. Stuff happens, memory gets corrupted and needs wiped, no problem. So I deleted the robot from the app and had to go through the mind-numbing and excruciating process of re-joining to my post 1995 WiFi network which is too fancy and elaborate with its new-fangled 5GHz technology for these developers to figure out (or Shark is too cheap and obsessed with profits to use a more modern WiFi SoC). Go through that process and run the explore another 10 times with no change.  Then I reset to supposedly factory settings. Same result. Same absolute rage-inducing nonsense getting it to connect to the WiFi (though I think I finally figured out the trick on that). I am not convinced it actually DOES reset to factory settings or wipes the memory clean, because I\\'m continuing to have the same problem. Exploration simply will not finish successfully and so I can\\'t schedule or make it clean without having to go under the table and push the button. Total ridiculousness. A factory reset should restore a copy of the firmware as it was when it came out of the factory -- and mapping worked out of the box. Now it doesn\\'t. I am left with the conclusion the reset does NOT actually reset the memory.  This is just infuriating. Oh, and before you say \"contact support\". I have. Crickets and bullfrogs, ladies and gentlemen. So far, crickets and bullfrogs. If that changes, I\\'ll post a new update, though.  Message to SharkNinja -- when you released an app, you became a software company. That has certain requirements and sets certain expectations. You are FAILING to meet any of them.  +++ HOW TO DEAL WITH MODERN WIFI AND THIS RIDICULOUS TWELVE CENT WIFI CHIP +++  The key to making this work is whether your phone is trying to access the Internet or any from anything other than the same 2.4GHz connection this unit is using. So what I have to do:  1. Log into Eero and turn of 5GHz (on my version this is under troubleshooting; nearly every mesh single-SSID system has a mechanism to temporarily disable 5GHz b/c this cheapness is so prevalent in so many devices) 2. Turn WiFi off on phone and leave off for a couple of minutes (this is a precaution to make sure 5GHz is truly not picking up the connection) 3. Turn mobile data off on my phone (airplane mode didn\\'t cut it 2 out of 3 times; turning off mobile data always worked) 4. Turn WiFi back on and make sure Bluetooth is on; if you tried airplane mode and left bluetooth off and don\\'t turn it back on again until the app prompts you, you\\'re hosed and will have to start over from the beginning - I experienced this multiple times 5. Put robot into discovery mode 6. Connect to the robot and go through the unnecessarily plentiful prompts full of stupid and useless information in the \"wizard\" 7. When you get to the network selection screen, your WiFi network SSID should show up --- if it doesn\\'t, one more thing to do is go into your phone WiFi settings and join your 2.4GHz network (keeping the Shark app in the background), which will disconnect you from the WiFi Direct connection with the robot; let it connect fully; then go disconnect from your access point and reconnect to the robot WiFi Direct AP in your phone settings. 1 out of 3 times I had to initiate that re-connection, which I\\'m guessing is due to some sort of timeout happening, but I\\'m not sure.  ***** PREVIOUS REVIEW ***** I got a previous version of this vacuum robot for my wife\\'s business space and was super impressed with it. It didn\\'t really NEED me to use WiFi and the app to make it work, and wow, she knew the floors were dirty, but not THAT dirty. It\\'s done really well for her in the couple of months she\\'s had it.  Come Prime Day 2024, I figured I\\'d pick something up for the house. Our Jack Russell terrier is getting older and shedding like a monster, and I abhor dog hair, so having something that could help us keep up with that was desirable. Having been an early adopter of the Roomba back in the day, the one thing I abhorred and has kept me from a robot vacuum since going through 2 or 3 early versions was emptying the anemic dust bins on these things. The self emptying on my wife\\'s has been awesome and I was looking at this to be even better because AI, right?  Well, yeah, not so much.  As a physical vacuum, the unit cleans pretty well. I don\\'t have any real complaints there, and the self-emptying is nice and has worked well so far. LOTS of dog hair in that bin. More than I realized was present, actually. Gross. But it is hands-free to empty which is pretty awesome. So it does clean (perhaps) even better than I expected.  This unit leaves me utterly disappointed in the app and it\\'s supposed AI, however. The intelligence is pretty artificial from what I can tell, and not in a good way.  Getting the system to map the house took three tries before it decided it actually did need to go into the big 20 square foot, devoid of any furniture, people or other obstructions area in my mud room. It did finally map the full space, and shows the area to be roughly 900 feet. By my calculations that\\'s roughly right, and the map is pretty close in its shape, though there is a big blob in one of the rooms I still don\\'t quite think aligns to reality. But it\\'s close enough, and the vacuum will still go into the area represented by the blob, so I\\'m not really sure what that\\'s about. I guess I could be misinterpreting the display, after all I don\\'t have Artificial Intelligence, I just have my brain.  Where the app falls utterly short, though is there is no true practical use of the intelligence the system has built about the area. It has a map, but can\\'t really use it in a meaningful way! The value of a robot vacuum isn\\'t to make a bunch of racket while running around a specific room while I\\'m entertaining or trying to watch a movie. The value proposition of a vacuum robot is to automate tasks I don\\'t want to do on my own. Like scheduling a cleaning job in a specific room at one time, and scheduling another cleaning job in another room during another time window. Being able to send the robot to a specific room ad hoc isn\\'t in the top 5 basic requirements I would post for a system like this. Top 10, maybe? But not before actual honest-to-goodness helpful AUTOMATION.  But Shark has not deemed the utilization of the map with the schedule to be an important feature for their app. It\\'s an FAQ as to whether you CAN do that, so it isn\\'t like they don\\'t KNOW people want this capability. And multi-point scheduling is something that vacuum robots have been able to do for years (iRobot\\'s app can do this for most models now, for instance, as can other brands). Multi-point scheduling is such a simple app task at this point there are libraries available for plugging that kind of function into a mobile app. Come on, Shark, you aren\\'t in the least bit intelligent if you can\\'t actually use the intelligence to do something useful!!! THIS IS SHAMEFUL and speaks to a complete lack of either 1) understanding your customer use cases or 2) caring enough about your customer to do something besides put your shortcomings into an FAQ.  SO you can\\'t schedule the vacuum to work on specific rooms it has mapped out at specific times, scheduled cleaning is an all or nothing thing. BUT, if you enable a no-go zone to try and, say, keep the dogs from being too overly disturbed during the all or nothing scheduled cleaning, that area is now apparently a black hole singularity for the vacuum and can never be gone into again as long as the circuits of the poor little creature draw power. Unless you of course go to the pain of deleting the no-go zone to get it spot cleaned, and then have to work with the app to maybe successfully recreate it.  The creation of rooms and no-go zones has been a spotty and painful action within the app. Sometimes it works, sometimes it hasn\\'t. I\\'ve had to go so far as to reboot my phone to get the \"resizer\" of a no-go zone to resize or move around on the map and the app acknowledge and save it properly. I\\'m done recreating the zones and will just sweep those from now on, I\\'m so fed up with it. The fact that you can\\'t override these zones for a spot clean, is again a sign of either complete development laziness or incompetence. It\\'s a simple matter of a question -- \"you\\'ve asked to spot clean this area, would you like to override the no-go zone for this session\" and then let the little guy run wild in his heretofore restricted space. It\\'s AI, after all, not just common human intelligence we\\'re working with here!!  The reason that the all or nothing approach to scheduled jobs sucks so bad is that this thing is LOUD. My wife\\'s unit is not loud like this one (I\\'m guessing the \\'superior\\' AI brain of this model must be making the loud clacking sound on our home model, but I\\'m not sure). From the first run taking it out of the box, it has made a terribly loud clacking sound as it runs around picking up dirt. I\\'ve looked at all the troubleshooting steps and the brush isn\\'t clogged, there\\'s nothing stuck in it, and it is firmly in place like it should be, but it definitely seems as if the bristles or the little blue sweeper stripes are hitting the cross bar of the guard hard enough to make an obnoxious sound. I know it\\'s brush bar related, because when the super brain was running around the house for three hours mapping things, it was actually relatively quiet -- enough so that if that\\'s how it was when doing its job, I\\'d have no other problems; alas that\\'s not the case.  SO, when you\\'re trying to get that scheduled all or nothing cleaning done overnight, and the kids are downstairs in the basement trying to sleep, all they hear is a thwack-thwack-thwack-thwack-thwack sound as it runs around the first floor. And since it seems ~900 square feet of space is too much for the system to do on a full charge, it starts doing that thwack-thwack-thwack thing at 3am after it has returned to the dock and recharged.  I do really like the \"return to recharge\" and \"return to empty\" features, don\\'t get me wrong they\\'re awesome, but with all the racket and the all or nothing approach, I can\\'t get the whole first floor vacuumed and the kids a full night\\'s sleep. It\\'s rather sad (first world problem, I know, I know, I should put brooms in the kids hands -- we do that too!) but for what you pay for this device (even on Prime Day) that claims to have an AI engine at play in its favor, I expect more.  And just to be clear, this isn\\'t a house that\\'s filthy with layers of dirt all over the floor by the time the little dude gets going. We swiffer and sweep throughout the day to clean up spot messes and we\\'re not living on a farm or something where we\\'re tracking in mud three inches deep a day. There\\'s kid chaff and some dog chaff around, but this isn\\'t a \"heavy\" mess we\\'re dealing with on a daily basis.  While I don\\'t love the unit, it does appear to me that proper app development and updates would resolve the problems I have (outside of the noise). I could work around the noise with more powerful intelligence brought to the scheduling, though, so I\\'m hopeful they\\'ll put the work in and resolve the shortcomings.

I bought this vacuum during this year\\'s Prime Day because I wanted to replace another brand that just wasn\\'t doing the job picking up my German Shepherd\\'s dog hair. I was constantly having to stop the other unit and pull hair out. After looking at online reviews on this one and another popular one and really reading the reviews, especially ones about dog hair I chose to purchase this one. So far I LOVE this one. I have all hard surfaces (wood and tile) in my house and it cleans both really well and here\\'s why. First, the roller on it isn\\'t a \"brush\" roller, it\\'s simpler and hair doesn\\'t get tangled up in it. When I first set up the vacuum it mapped my house and afterward, I was able to set up zones or rooms so I could select specific areas to vacuum such as high traffic areas, etc. After it mapped the house I could see the \"map\" of the house and it was pretty accurate. Then my vac started cleaning and I could even select the level of clean I want also. But wait, there\\'s more! Lol I have the app on my phone so I can select clean, ultra clean, eco/normal/max. I have it on ultra clean. So here\\'s the great part, my last vac was \"random\" whereas this one literally goes row by row to vacuum and it also does the edges. I have included a video so you can see what I\\'m talking about. Then my vacuum, aptly named \"Hair Destroyer\" will take itself home and the base will literally suck all the hair/dirt out into the basin storage and my vacuum goes back out on its\\' merry way to keep on cleaning! YASSSS The unit recharges nicely, is easy to make schedules (I have mine on Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat) and I haven\\'t seen the hair on the floor. It is also cleaning smaller rugs by the doors well.  The clearance height on it is a little higher (about 4 1/2 inches high) but it still goes under the couches and most other furnishings I have. I still have a dust mop for areas around plants in the corners, etc that are not wide enough for it to fit through - hey this thing isn\\'t perfect but it\\'s close. Next, you\\'ll want to know that with as much dog hair that this thing picks up I empty it every 2nd day it runs to keep the bin in the base clean. Some people said it filled up quickly, well mine did the 1st couple of times also because of the amount of hair it picked up.  This unit is not loud, it\\'s quieter than my last one. I read reviews that said it was loud but it isn\\'t. It plays a sound when it\\'s going home to empty and then it plays a different sound when it\\'s going back out. Neither bother me. Be sure to let it map the house, you\\'ll be glad you did. Be sure to register it. I had one issue of it not getting the charge but I think it was user error and when I called customer service (CS) they were helpful and it was back to doing what it\\'s supposed to do. The preliminary steps the CS rep used to determine what was wrong were in my opinion elementary, items I had already done but the customer service rep said it was required.

Overall, I love it, I would recommend this particular vacuum to anyone. But I have never owned a \"smart\" vacuum, just a cheap one that runs around aimlessly so I have no other vacuums to base my opinion off of besides what I think of how this one performs.  Positives first: • row by row vacuuming. It overlaps it\\'s last row so it doesn\\'t miss anything • scheduling. You can set it to auto vacuum whatever day and whatever time you want (see negative below for the other side of this opinion) but I love the scheduling. • does great on carpet and tile. The wheels adjust quite a bit to accommodate the carpet and dropping to the tile off the carpet. • adding \"no go\" areas. On the map on the app you can place a no go area in a mapped out area. For me, I placed a no go around one of my couches because the vacuum doesn\\'t see the back of the couch as a boundary so it had no issue off roading up inside the couch and then getting stuck. Hilarious initially, but at least theres the no go function so I could put an end to it\\'s off roading adventures. • picks up way more than I figured it actually would! • leaves suction lines in the carpet, and no animal hair left after it makes it\\'s rounds. • Cleans up next to EVERYTHING! I figured it would hem haw and somewhat get near things to clean, nope, it gets right up next to every edge. • if it misses a spot (something in the way etc) it will go on cleaning but I\\'m the end make it\\'s way back to that spot to try cleaning it again. • self emptying base that is BAGLESS!!! • Price. Yes it is still expensive, but there\\'s more expensive out there, and for what you\\'re getting I believe the price was good. Caught this one on sale.  Now for the few negatives.... • Scheduling. Remember the positives I mentioned? The negative to the scheduling is you can\\'t set a different time for different days. I set mine to 6 am. So everyday I have it scheduled it starts at 6 am. No 8 pm on Monday, 6 am on Tuesday. You get one time choice. Next thing, you can\\'t schedule it to go off more than once a day. You can only pick if you want it to auto clean that day and that\\'s it. Next thing, if you have it map out your entire house initially, when it auto cleans you cannot choose for it to only clean certain rooms on certain days. It\\'s all the rooms only. So, I only had it map out the half of my house that I want auto cleaned everyday (I have a baby gate that closes off the hallway to the rest of the house so it only mapped my dining room, kitchen, and living room that are all attached). • after you do the initial mapping of your house you cannot \"add a room\" to your map. If you want to add more rooms to your map you have to delete the current map and have it remap the entire house again. • capacity of the base. It\\'s supposed to hold 30 days worth of hair, dander, trash, etc. If you actually live in your house, or have animals, don\\'t expect it to hold 30 days worth of stuff. I have to empty mine every 2 to 3 days, and I don\\'t have a big house or a messy house. • notification messages on the app. Initially on the app it didn\\'t have many notifications about the vacuum, but after using it for a couple weeks and getting it broken it seems like it has notifications constantly. It will have several messages about being near a cliff and it\\'s going to fall off (I have no stairs or anything it gets caught on?), It will constantly tell you that you need to empty the bin or that it has debris blocking the bottom of it that you need to clean. And usually it has none of those and the bin isn\\'t full. It\\'s weird. But worth noting on the review. •also worth noting, very seldom, but on my tile floor sometimes the bristles will actually knock the debris away from it instead of sucking it in. I\\'m sure all of the robot vacuums have this issue.  In conclusion. The scheduling and the mapping mentioned above is my only complaints and something to think about if you\\'re considering buying this. But you should definitely get it if you\\'re on the fence about it!!! I have no regrets about my purchase besides I wish I would have bought it sooner!

Highly recommend this vacuum to everyone, my wife agrees! Happy wife, happy life! Might buy another for my upstairs. For a robot vacuum, it does what I expect and makes my life easier. I don't make it pick up large debris, robot vacuums seem to perform best with small debris. Large debris may get stuck or caught. Lidar works phenomenal, but with some hiccups when mapping house (mostly human error). Routing around obstacles works well, slows around objects and if anything is bumped it's so light and cushioned, it's not a problem. 5 stars overall. 4 stars deep cleaning and suction leaving room for improvement, it's a robot vacuum, what do you expect? Probably has Alexa integration, but I use Google assistant and it works great!  ---  I ordered this back in July 2022 and got it end of the month. I waited some time to let the excitement die a little before posting a review, but it never really did. This is my first robot vacuum and one of the best purchase decisions I have made this year. When researching for the right robot vacuum, I found that most of the highly rated vacuums don't seem to make it past 6 months or a year when reading reviews. Also manufacturers seems to make new models every year, so finding something that is reliable and lasts longer than this timeframe is hard to find. Of course, I am only onto my 5th month of owning this vacuum.  When I broke the vacuum out of the box, my first inclination was to take it out and get it started. But thinking about the other reviews I have read on this vacuum and others like it, I wanted to read the instructions first. This is not a regular vacuum that you plug in and push. It has lots of little parts that make it different and potentially not taking care of it properly could damage the device. So anybody reading this, read the instructions first. Understand how to properly take care of it and clean it. Also, comparing to other reviews, clean it regularly.  Now for my somewhat long review:  Is it quiet? Yes and no. It is a robot vacuum, how loud do you expect it to be? You're not doing the work, but it is. It is quieter than a regular vacuum, but no idea how quiet other robot vacuums are. If a robot vacuum is loud or quiet, who cares? What matters is that it can clean stuff.  Can you watch tv while it runs? Yes you can watch tv. Just turn up the volume a little, no need to blast it like when running a normal push vacuum.  Can it pick up everything? No, it's a robot vacuum. Don't put too much trust in it. What I typically do is remove all obstacles (cords, bags, blankets) from the ground and any larger debris that might get caught in the motors (cotton balls left from the dog, pieces left behind from chewed up toys, strings from rope toys).  Dog hair? My dog constantly sheds, but has short hair. I run it twice per week on thin carpet and once per week on hard floors. I don't notice the dog hair until I see what the vacuum picked up and it does a great job! The majority of stuff this picks up is dog hair and a lot of it. For longer haired dogs or thicker haired dogs, I assume this will get the job done as long human hair doesn't get stuck at all like my regular vacuum does.  Small leaves? It picks up small leaves and debris similar size, but may leaf some behind. It also might get caught in spinning brushes and make a slightly louder noise on hard floor. I waited for it to finish and then pulled the leaf out, no harm.  Dog kibble? Ok this one was an accident, didn't see it against the brown colored floor before starting vacuum. Sounded like the robot was choking and about to die, literally. I had to stop it right away and retrieve the small rock sized (width of thumbnail) dog food from the vacuum.  Can you run it when away from home? I read too many horror stories of vacuums cleaning pet poop, but it is not the reason I don't start it when I'm not home. Like the last two points, if something gets caught, you need to be there to fish it out. I may have spot checked the floor, but even that sometimes isn't good enough. Also, one time a week or two ago, it finally got confused and couldn't move past a futon leg. It kept spinning back and forth (maybe for 5 minutes) until I nudged the futon half an inch, then it broke free of its endless loop. This was the only time this ever happened since I got it. Every other time it does an excellent job of finding its way through, even finding its way through a jungle of table and chair legs.  Lidar mapping floorplan? Simply amazing! I had it map 4 different rooms. The first time was great, but missed a few minor areas, of which was my fault. I left things on the floor and in the way of the robot when it mapped the floorplan. The second time, I removed the obstacles, but it didn't map another room properly. The third time, I removed a chair, which the robot vacuum had just enough clearance to fit under (1st time it went under, 2nd time it did not), so that it can map that area of the carpet and not count it as a wall.  Lidar in general? It works great to avoid obstacles and get around legs of any sort. Only thing is if the leg is curved, like my kitchen table, it doesn't know when to properly maneuver around it. But no worries! The bumper is amazing! It lightly bumps in to obstacles and the vacuum does a minor adjustment to figure out how to go around it.  Damaging furniture? Nope! Doesn't happen. The robot is so careful around obstacles and even when it does bump things, its lightly bumps it and doesn't scratch or anything. When it approaches obstacles (walls or furniture) it moves at a slower pace. This thing is intelligent.  Suction? For a robot vacuum, it does everything it needs to and does it very well. There are different levels for suction in the app, I have only needed to use the normal section. The max suction I have never needed to use, but it is an option if things get too out of hand. There is also an ultra clean option, not tried it, but think it just spends more time going over stuff. If I ever try ultra clean option, maybe need to change deep clean star to a 5, but I'm making the assumption that it will never perform as well as a normal vacuum.  Battery? I run two rooms per day I run it, but sometimes do all 4 rooms when I forget to run it. It lasts easily to finish all 4 rooms with charge left over. I'm guessing lowest percentage of battery life was 35% or 40% after doing all 4, this is a wild guess though, could've been higher. For 2 rooms it's usually at 60% after it's done, that I know for sure.  Emptying? It has a bin that it empties to. If the robot either runs for too long (or not sure if it senses if it is full of junk) it may return to the docking station to empty itself. This system works great, but the bin needs to be cleaned out occasionally. There is also a filter in the bin system that needs to be cleaned, just like regular vacuums may have.  App? No issues running it on my Android. Can select rooms and see the layout easily. Drawing rooms works great as well!  Robotiness? It makes all the noises a robot vacuum should and it's awesome! Just thought you should know! Beep boop boop!  Ratings: I give it 5 stars because as it is a robot vacuum, it meets all of my expectations. 4 stars on deep cleaning and suction because it isn't perfect, but is excellent as a robot vacuum. I haven't used my regular vacuum in the areas that this one runs because it seems to do such a great job. Integration with Google works great! I don't use Alexa with this one. Again, this is one of the best purchases I made this year. Definitely recommend this vacuum to everyone.

It was easy to set up out of the box, the robot vac is configured with an app on your phone. Steve McClean needed time to charge before he could map the floor plan. I bought Steve for the upstairs which is wall to wall carpet with tile in the bathrooms and laundry room, and a week later added Rosie for the downstairs, which is all hardwood with throw rugs. I followed Steve on his first mapping mission and was impressed that he figured out the stairs on his own. I couldn’t fully decipher the map of the floor plan he produced on the first go round to set up no go areas, I did that step after a few runs when I had completed job maps to compare with. Steve did a great job on all floors the first time out. I had vacuumed with my Shark upright ahead of time and I was amazed by the amount of dust, hair and lint the Steve picked up. Steve goes under beds and tables the upright couldn't get to. After a few cleaning sessions I purchased Rosie for the downstairs which is all hardwood floors with throw rugs. Rosie is scheduled to work every night, I love walking downstairs in the mornings to clean floors. Through the app I was able to set up both robots to specify rooms and no-go areas on the floor plan, and schedule cleanings. When I had an unscheduled call during a cleaning session, I was able to use the app to pause Steve until the call was over. I allowed the app to send notifications to my phone and have received notifications for low battery when the robots are accidentally bumped off their docks and a notification that Rosie was going to fall off a cliff. Turns out she was just tied up in some cords. She stayed there all night until her battery died. Cords are a challenge for the robot vacuums, it has forced me to put away any cords that are not in use and organize those that are. I’m still working on identifying and setting those areas up as no-go. I work at home during the day and have set up Steve’s cleaning times for when I don’t have calls scheduled. The vacuuming itself isn’t particularly loud but the emptying when going to the docking station is. The robots dock themselves for emptying and charging.

We don’t have any family around to help out with chores after baby is here which will leave my poor husband a 5 acre plot of land, a house, three dogs, and a wife/baby to tend to all by himself for a little bit. I also can barely get anything done since I have to vacuum every other day right now. My poor cankles!  Out of desperation I gave this a try since it was on sale and, God bless America, this is the best thing ever.  Ill start with cons since thats what most people really want to know:  Wifi was tricky to connect BUT the best place for the base in my home is on the opposite side of the house from the modem. I could have moved it closer if all else failed but after a good 20 minutes of trial and error, I got it connected. After that, the app was very user friendly i found.  My dogs have a little water spillage by their bowl so hair sometimes sticks from the roller into those spots but its a small space and doesn’t bother me. I usually do a whole house pick up before I start it anyways.  Because of the immense amount of hair this thing picks up, I empty it weekly. Again, not a big deal to me.  PROS:  Literally everything. It does a really good job at mapping my house. It gets in corners shockingly well. Its not perfect but if it misses a spot, you can send it on a “spot clean.” This model doesnt have lots of bells and whistles. No mopping feature, not super silent. However, that usually means it does one thing very well and that is vacuum. Thats all I wanted. Something to pick up dog hair and dirt from dogs and husband. While its not dead silent, its way quieter than my giant Shark pet hair vacuum. I also don’t need something totally quiet. A baby can definitely sleep through it. Its more like white noise to me. And you can adjust the volume of the base from the app. No dog hair has gotten stuck in the rollers but if you find Sharky is leaving behind clumps of hair, you probably need to empty out the base.  Note: I have only hardwood and tile flooring. It goes over the mat by the door very well thus far but keep in mind I have no real say in if this is great for a mostly carpeted home.

It\\'s app enrages me more every single day and I\\'m about to simply put it in the attic because without the app it becomes increasingly useless; I wish I could take away more stars this app is so bad. I\\'m hoping SharkNinja cares enough to read these reviews and actually takes action, otherwise they may go the way of Sonos with their horrible app decisions. This isn\\'t 2005 when iRobot could do stupid things and get away with it because there was no competition. While I\\'m not one to throw money away, I will replace this with something else that actually works and doesn\\'t need an app to do simple scheduled cleaning runs. I could give two hoots about whether it has a \"map\" at this point, just clean the doggone floor -- do the basic thing you claim to be able to do and do it well. Is that so hard?  I\\'m guessing they don\\'t care given they can\\'t seem to do simple things like when I log into their website with exactly the same credentials I use in the app, it doesn\\'t show my registered products, or when I scan the QR code in the app to store the Model and S/N it can\\'t store it for more than about 5 minutes before it literally just disappears. If you can\\'t do simple things, complex ones are probably out of reach.  The system has some kind of serious software bug in it related to map storage. I work for a software company, and all the signs are present that there is a significant problem with the storage system for maps and/or the communication between the app and the robot relating to the map. I say this because our robot just lost its map one day about a month ago. No errors, no problems running, it just literally disappeared. The schedule continued to run, so I didn\\'t notice it until I looked at the cleaning notification one day and noticed that it was reporting a run time of almost 2 hours (which sounded about right) but a 0 ft squared cleaned. It sure made a lot of noise and picked up a lot of dirt for not cleaning any square footage of my first floor! When I dug into the app, the map was gone. Just not there. When going into settings to look at the map, I just get the infuriating purple spinner. No messages, no indicators of a problem, just a total lack of communication about what is going on and no map.  So I set about the task of trying to correct the problem. First, I delete the map and go to try and re-explore. It seems to delete, and it will run an exploration run, but then it just sits with that obnoxious purple spinner and the question about whether the map represents the home properly or should it re-explore, with the Accept button greyed out and NO OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE. I\\'ve re-explored 20 times and left it sitting on that screen overnight for 8 hours with it never finishing. Ever. And this is why it\\'s about to become trash!!! Without running the explore successfully, you can\\'t set the schedule! You can\\'t run a manual cleaning run with the app! If I wanted a vacuum I had to physically go push the button on, I could have bought something a heck of a lot less expensive (which is what I\\'m likely to do at this point).  SO then I thought, like most technology of this sort, it might just need a complete fresh start. Stuff happens, memory gets corrupted and needs wiped, no problem. So I deleted the robot from the app and had to go through the mind-numbing and excruciating process of re-joining to my post 1995 WiFi network which is too fancy and elaborate with its new-fangled 5GHz technology for these developers to figure out (or Shark is too cheap and obsessed with profits to use a more modern WiFi SoC). Go through that process and run the explore another 10 times with no change.  Then I reset to supposedly factory settings. Same result. Same absolute rage-inducing nonsense getting it to connect to the WiFi (though I think I finally figured out the trick on that). I am not convinced it actually DOES reset to factory settings or wipes the memory clean, because I\\'m continuing to have the same problem. Exploration simply will not finish successfully and so I can\\'t schedule or make it clean without having to go under the table and push the button. Total ridiculousness. A factory reset should restore a copy of the firmware as it was when it came out of the factory -- and mapping worked out of the box. Now it doesn\\'t. I am left with the conclusion the reset does NOT actually reset the memory.  This is just infuriating. Oh, and before you say \"contact support\". I have. Crickets and bullfrogs, ladies and gentlemen. So far, crickets and bullfrogs. If that changes, I\\'ll post a new update, though.  Message to SharkNinja -- when you released an app, you became a software company. That has certain requirements and sets certain expectations. You are FAILING to meet any of them.  +++ HOW TO DEAL WITH MODERN WIFI AND THIS RIDICULOUS TWELVE CENT WIFI CHIP +++  The key to making this work is whether your phone is trying to access the Internet or any from anything other than the same 2.4GHz connection this unit is using. So what I have to do:  1. Log into Eero and turn of 5GHz (on my version this is under troubleshooting; nearly every mesh single-SSID system has a mechanism to temporarily disable 5GHz b/c this cheapness is so prevalent in so many devices) 2. Turn WiFi off on phone and leave off for a couple of minutes (this is a precaution to make sure 5GHz is truly not picking up the connection) 3. Turn mobile data off on my phone (airplane mode didn\\'t cut it 2 out of 3 times; turning off mobile data always worked) 4. Turn WiFi back on and make sure Bluetooth is on; if you tried airplane mode and left bluetooth off and don\\'t turn it back on again until the app prompts you, you\\'re hosed and will have to start over from the beginning - I experienced this multiple times 5. Put robot into discovery mode 6. Connect to the robot and go through the unnecessarily plentiful prompts full of stupid and useless information in the \"wizard\" 7. When you get to the network selection screen, your WiFi network SSID should show up --- if it doesn\\'t, one more thing to do is go into your phone WiFi settings and join your 2.4GHz network (keeping the Shark app in the background), which will disconnect you from the WiFi Direct connection with the robot; let it connect fully; then go disconnect from your access point and reconnect to the robot WiFi Direct AP in your phone settings. 1 out of 3 times I had to initiate that re-connection, which I\\'m guessing is due to some sort of timeout happening, but I\\'m not sure.  ***** PREVIOUS REVIEW ***** I got a previous version of this vacuum robot for my wife\\'s business space and was super impressed with it. It didn\\'t really NEED me to use WiFi and the app to make it work, and wow, she knew the floors were dirty, but not THAT dirty. It\\'s done really well for her in the couple of months she\\'s had it.  Come Prime Day 2024, I figured I\\'d pick something up for the house. Our Jack Russell terrier is getting older and shedding like a monster, and I abhor dog hair, so having something that could help us keep up with that was desirable. Having been an early adopter of the Roomba back in the day, the one thing I abhorred and has kept me from a robot vacuum since going through 2 or 3 early versions was emptying the anemic dust bins on these things. The self emptying on my wife\\'s has been awesome and I was looking at this to be even better because AI, right?  Well, yeah, not so much.  As a physical vacuum, the unit cleans pretty well. I don\\'t have any real complaints there, and the self-emptying is nice and has worked well so far. LOTS of dog hair in that bin. More than I realized was present, actually. Gross. But it is hands-free to empty which is pretty awesome. So it does clean (perhaps) even better than I expected.  This unit leaves me utterly disappointed in the app and it\\'s supposed AI, however. The intelligence is pretty artificial from what I can tell, and not in a good way.  Getting the system to map the house took three tries before it decided it actually did need to go into the big 20 square foot, devoid of any furniture, people or other obstructions area in my mud room. It did finally map the full space, and shows the area to be roughly 900 feet. By my calculations that\\'s roughly right, and the map is pretty close in its shape, though there is a big blob in one of the rooms I still don\\'t quite think aligns to reality. But it\\'s close enough, and the vacuum will still go into the area represented by the blob, so I\\'m not really sure what that\\'s about. I guess I could be misinterpreting the display, after all I don\\'t have Artificial Intelligence, I just have my brain.  Where the app falls utterly short, though is there is no true practical use of the intelligence the system has built about the area. It has a map, but can\\'t really use it in a meaningful way! The value of a robot vacuum isn\\'t to make a bunch of racket while running around a specific room while I\\'m entertaining or trying to watch a movie. The value proposition of a vacuum robot is to automate tasks I don\\'t want to do on my own. Like scheduling a cleaning job in a specific room at one time, and scheduling another cleaning job in another room during another time window. Being able to send the robot to a specific room ad hoc isn\\'t in the top 5 basic requirements I would post for a system like this. Top 10, maybe? But not before actual honest-to-goodness helpful AUTOMATION.  But Shark has not deemed the utilization of the map with the schedule to be an important feature for their app. It\\'s an FAQ as to whether you CAN do that, so it isn\\'t like they don\\'t KNOW people want this capability. And multi-point scheduling is something that vacuum robots have been able to do for years (iRobot\\'s app can do this for most models now, for instance, as can other brands). Multi-point scheduling is such a simple app task at this point there are libraries available for plugging that kind of function into a mobile app. Come on, Shark, you aren\\'t in the least bit intelligent if you can\\'t actually use the intelligence to do something useful!!! THIS IS SHAMEFUL and speaks to a complete lack of either 1) understanding your customer use cases or 2) caring enough about your customer to do something besides put your shortcomings into an FAQ.  SO you can\\'t schedule the vacuum to work on specific rooms it has mapped out at specific times, scheduled cleaning is an all or nothing thing. BUT, if you enable a no-go zone to try and, say, keep the dogs from being too overly disturbed during the all or nothing scheduled cleaning, that area is now apparently a black hole singularity for the vacuum and can never be gone into again as long as the circuits of the poor little creature draw power. Unless you of course go to the pain of deleting the no-go zone to get it spot cleaned, and then have to work with the app to maybe successfully recreate it.  The creation of rooms and no-go zones has been a spotty and painful action within the app. Sometimes it works, sometimes it hasn\\'t. I\\'ve had to go so far as to reboot my phone to get the \"resizer\" of a no-go zone to resize or move around on the map and the app acknowledge and save it properly. I\\'m done recreating the zones and will just sweep those from now on, I\\'m so fed up with it. The fact that you can\\'t override these zones for a spot clean, is again a sign of either complete development laziness or incompetence. It\\'s a simple matter of a question -- \"you\\'ve asked to spot clean this area, would you like to override the no-go zone for this session\" and then let the little guy run wild in his heretofore restricted space. It\\'s AI, after all, not just common human intelligence we\\'re working with here!!  The reason that the all or nothing approach to scheduled jobs sucks so bad is that this thing is LOUD. My wife\\'s unit is not loud like this one (I\\'m guessing the \\'superior\\' AI brain of this model must be making the loud clacking sound on our home model, but I\\'m not sure). From the first run taking it out of the box, it has made a terribly loud clacking sound as it runs around picking up dirt. I\\'ve looked at all the troubleshooting steps and the brush isn\\'t clogged, there\\'s nothing stuck in it, and it is firmly in place like it should be, but it definitely seems as if the bristles or the little blue sweeper stripes are hitting the cross bar of the guard hard enough to make an obnoxious sound. I know it\\'s brush bar related, because when the super brain was running around the house for three hours mapping things, it was actually relatively quiet -- enough so that if that\\'s how it was when doing its job, I\\'d have no other problems; alas that\\'s not the case.  SO, when you\\'re trying to get that scheduled all or nothing cleaning done overnight, and the kids are downstairs in the basement trying to sleep, all they hear is a thwack-thwack-thwack-thwack-thwack sound as it runs around the first floor. And since it seems ~900 square feet of space is too much for the system to do on a full charge, it starts doing that thwack-thwack-thwack thing at 3am after it has returned to the dock and recharged.  I do really like the \"return to recharge\" and \"return to empty\" features, don\\'t get me wrong they\\'re awesome, but with all the racket and the all or nothing approach, I can\\'t get the whole first floor vacuumed and the kids a full night\\'s sleep. It\\'s rather sad (first world problem, I know, I know, I should put brooms in the kids hands -- we do that too!) but for what you pay for this device (even on Prime Day) that claims to have an AI engine at play in its favor, I expect more.  And just to be clear, this isn\\'t a house that\\'s filthy with layers of dirt all over the floor by the time the little dude gets going. We swiffer and sweep throughout the day to clean up spot messes and we\\'re not living on a farm or something where we\\'re tracking in mud three inches deep a day. There\\'s kid chaff and some dog chaff around, but this isn\\'t a \"heavy\" mess we\\'re dealing with on a daily basis.  While I don\\'t love the unit, it does appear to me that proper app development and updates would resolve the problems I have (outside of the noise). I could work around the noise with more powerful intelligence brought to the scheduling, though, so I\\'m hopeful they\\'ll put the work in and resolve the shortcomings.

I bought this vacuum during this year\\'s Prime Day because I wanted to replace another brand that just wasn\\'t doing the job picking up my German Shepherd\\'s dog hair. I was constantly having to stop the other unit and pull hair out. After looking at online reviews on this one and another popular one and really reading the reviews, especially ones about dog hair I chose to purchase this one. So far I LOVE this one. I have all hard surfaces (wood and tile) in my house and it cleans both really well and here\\'s why. First, the roller on it isn\\'t a \"brush\" roller, it\\'s simpler and hair doesn\\'t get tangled up in it. When I first set up the vacuum it mapped my house and afterward, I was able to set up zones or rooms so I could select specific areas to vacuum such as high traffic areas, etc. After it mapped the house I could see the \"map\" of the house and it was pretty accurate. Then my vac started cleaning and I could even select the level of clean I want also. But wait, there\\'s more! Lol I have the app on my phone so I can select clean, ultra clean, eco/normal/max. I have it on ultra clean. So here\\'s the great part, my last vac was \"random\" whereas this one literally goes row by row to vacuum and it also does the edges. I have included a video so you can see what I\\'m talking about. Then my vacuum, aptly named \"Hair Destroyer\" will take itself home and the base will literally suck all the hair/dirt out into the basin storage and my vacuum goes back out on its\\' merry way to keep on cleaning! YASSSS The unit recharges nicely, is easy to make schedules (I have mine on Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat) and I haven\\'t seen the hair on the floor. It is also cleaning smaller rugs by the doors well.  The clearance height on it is a little higher (about 4 1/2 inches high) but it still goes under the couches and most other furnishings I have. I still have a dust mop for areas around plants in the corners, etc that are not wide enough for it to fit through - hey this thing isn\\'t perfect but it\\'s close. Next, you\\'ll want to know that with as much dog hair that this thing picks up I empty it every 2nd day it runs to keep the bin in the base clean. Some people said it filled up quickly, well mine did the 1st couple of times also because of the amount of hair it picked up.  This unit is not loud, it\\'s quieter than my last one. I read reviews that said it was loud but it isn\\'t. It plays a sound when it\\'s going home to empty and then it plays a different sound when it\\'s going back out. Neither bother me. Be sure to let it map the house, you\\'ll be glad you did. Be sure to register it. I had one issue of it not getting the charge but I think it was user error and when I called customer service (CS) they were helpful and it was back to doing what it\\'s supposed to do. The preliminary steps the CS rep used to determine what was wrong were in my opinion elementary, items I had already done but the customer service rep said it was required.

Overall, I love it, I would recommend this particular vacuum to anyone. But I have never owned a \"smart\" vacuum, just a cheap one that runs around aimlessly so I have no other vacuums to base my opinion off of besides what I think of how this one performs.  Positives first: • row by row vacuuming. It overlaps it\\'s last row so it doesn\\'t miss anything • scheduling. You can set it to auto vacuum whatever day and whatever time you want (see negative below for the other side of this opinion) but I love the scheduling. • does great on carpet and tile. The wheels adjust quite a bit to accommodate the carpet and dropping to the tile off the carpet. • adding \"no go\" areas. On the map on the app you can place a no go area in a mapped out area. For me, I placed a no go around one of my couches because the vacuum doesn\\'t see the back of the couch as a boundary so it had no issue off roading up inside the couch and then getting stuck. Hilarious initially, but at least theres the no go function so I could put an end to it\\'s off roading adventures. • picks up way more than I figured it actually would! • leaves suction lines in the carpet, and no animal hair left after it makes it\\'s rounds. • Cleans up next to EVERYTHING! I figured it would hem haw and somewhat get near things to clean, nope, it gets right up next to every edge. • if it misses a spot (something in the way etc) it will go on cleaning but I\\'m the end make it\\'s way back to that spot to try cleaning it again. • self emptying base that is BAGLESS!!! • Price. Yes it is still expensive, but there\\'s more expensive out there, and for what you\\'re getting I believe the price was good. Caught this one on sale.  Now for the few negatives.... • Scheduling. Remember the positives I mentioned? The negative to the scheduling is you can\\'t set a different time for different days. I set mine to 6 am. So everyday I have it scheduled it starts at 6 am. No 8 pm on Monday, 6 am on Tuesday. You get one time choice. Next thing, you can\\'t schedule it to go off more than once a day. You can only pick if you want it to auto clean that day and that\\'s it. Next thing, if you have it map out your entire house initially, when it auto cleans you cannot choose for it to only clean certain rooms on certain days. It\\'s all the rooms only. So, I only had it map out the half of my house that I want auto cleaned everyday (I have a baby gate that closes off the hallway to the rest of the house so it only mapped my dining room, kitchen, and living room that are all attached). • after you do the initial mapping of your house you cannot \"add a room\" to your map. If you want to add more rooms to your map you have to delete the current map and have it remap the entire house again. • capacity of the base. It\\'s supposed to hold 30 days worth of hair, dander, trash, etc. If you actually live in your house, or have animals, don\\'t expect it to hold 30 days worth of stuff. I have to empty mine every 2 to 3 days, and I don\\'t have a big house or a messy house. • notification messages on the app. Initially on the app it didn\\'t have many notifications about the vacuum, but after using it for a couple weeks and getting it broken it seems like it has notifications constantly. It will have several messages about being near a cliff and it\\'s going to fall off (I have no stairs or anything it gets caught on?), It will constantly tell you that you need to empty the bin or that it has debris blocking the bottom of it that you need to clean. And usually it has none of those and the bin isn\\'t full. It\\'s weird. But worth noting on the review. •also worth noting, very seldom, but on my tile floor sometimes the bristles will actually knock the debris away from it instead of sucking it in. I\\'m sure all of the robot vacuums have this issue.  In conclusion. The scheduling and the mapping mentioned above is my only complaints and something to think about if you\\'re considering buying this. But you should definitely get it if you\\'re on the fence about it!!! I have no regrets about my purchase besides I wish I would have bought it sooner!

Highly recommend this vacuum to everyone, my wife agrees! Happy wife, happy life! Might buy another for my upstairs. For a robot vacuum, it does what I expect and makes my life easier.

Probably has Alexa integration, but I use Google assistant and it works great!  ---  I ordered this back in July 2022 and got it end of the month. I waited some time to let the excitement die a little before posting a review, but it never really did. This is my first robot vacuum and one of the best purchase decisions I have made this year. When researching for the right robot vacuum, I found that most of the highly rated vacuums don't seem to make it past 6 months or a year when reading reviews. Also manufacturers seems to make new models every year, so finding something that is reliable and lasts longer than this timeframe is hard to find. Of course, I am only onto my 5th month of owning this vacuum.  When I broke the vacuum out of the box, my first inclination was to take it out and get it started. But thinking about the other reviews I have read on this vacuum and others like it, I wanted to read the instructions first. This is not a regular vacuum that you plug in and push. It has lots of little parts that make it different and potentially not taking care of it properly could damage the device. So anybody reading this, read the instructions first. Understand how to properly take care of it and clean it. Also, comparing to other reviews, clean it regularly.  Now for my somewhat long review:  Is it quiet? Yes and no. It is a robot vacuum, how loud do you expect it to be? You're not doing the work, but it is. It is quieter than a regular vacuum, but no idea how quiet other robot vacuums are. If a robot vacuum is loud or quiet, who cares? What matters is that it can clean stuff.  Can you watch tv while it runs? Yes you can watch tv. Just turn up the volume a little, no need to blast it like when running a normal push vacuum.  Can it pick up everything? No, it's a robot vacuum. Don't put too much trust in it. What I typically do is remove all obstacles (cords, bags, blankets) from the ground and any larger debris that might get caught in the motors (cotton balls left from the dog, pieces left behind from chewed up toys, strings from rope toys).  Dog hair? My dog constantly sheds, but has short hair. I run it twice per week on thin carpet and once per week on hard floors. I don't notice the dog hair until I see what the vacuum picked up and it does a great job! The majority of stuff this picks up is dog hair and a lot of it. For longer haired dogs or thicker haired dogs, I assume this will get the job done as long human hair doesn't get stuck at all like my regular vacuum does.  Small leaves? It picks up small leaves and debris similar size, but may leaf some behind. It also might get caught in spinning brushes and make a slightly louder noise on hard floor. I waited for it to finish and then pulled the leaf out, no harm.  Dog kibble? Ok this one was an accident, didn't see it against the brown colored floor before starting vacuum. Sounded like the robot was choking and about to die, literally. I had to stop it right away and retrieve the small rock sized (width of thumbnail) dog food from the vacuum.  Can you run it when away from home? I read too many horror stories of vacuums cleaning pet poop, but it is not the reason I don't start it when I'm not home. Like the last two points, if something gets caught, you need to be there to fish it out. I may have spot checked the floor, but even that sometimes isn't good enough. Also, one time a week or two ago, it finally got confused and couldn't move past a futon leg. It kept spinning back and forth (maybe for 5 minutes) until I nudged the futon half an inch, then it broke free of its endless loop. This was the only time this ever happened since I got it. Every other time it does an excellent job of finding its way through, even finding its way through a jungle of table and chair legs.  Lidar mapping floorplan? Simply amazing! I had it map 4 different rooms. The first time was great, but missed a few minor areas, of which was my fault. I left things on the floor and in the way of the robot when it mapped the floorplan. The second time, I removed the obstacles, but it didn't map another room properly. The third time, I removed a chair, which the robot vacuum had just enough clearance to fit under (1st time it went under, 2nd time it did not), so that it can map that area of the carpet and not count it as a wall.  Lidar in general? It works great to avoid obstacles and get around legs of any sort. Only thing is if the leg is curved, like my kitchen table, it doesn't know when to properly maneuver around it. But no worries! The bumper is amazing! It lightly bumps in to obstacles and the vacuum does a minor adjustment to figure out how to go around it.  Damaging furniture? Nope! Doesn't happen. The robot is so careful around obstacles and even when it does bump things, its lightly bumps it and doesn't scratch or anything. When it approaches obstacles (walls or furniture) it moves at a slower pace. This thing is intelligent.  Suction? For a robot vacuum, it does everything it needs to and does it very well. There are different levels for suction in the app, I have only needed to use the normal section. The max suction I have never needed to use, but it is an option if things get too out of hand. There is also an ultra clean option, not tried it, but think it just spends more time going over stuff. If I ever try ultra clean option, maybe need to change deep clean star to a 5, but I'm making the assumption that it will never perform as well as a normal vacuum.  Battery? I run two rooms per day I run it, but sometimes do all 4 rooms when I forget to run it. It lasts easily to finish all 4 rooms with charge left over. I'm guessing lowest percentage of battery life was 35% or 40% after doing all 4, this is a wild guess though, could've been higher. For 2 rooms it's usually at 60% after it's done, that I know for sure.  Emptying? It has a bin that it empties to. If the robot either runs for too long (or not sure if it senses if it is full of junk) it may return to the docking station to empty itself. This system works great, but the bin needs to be cleaned out occasionally. There is also a filter in the bin system that needs to be cleaned, just like regular vacuums may have.  App? No issues running it on my Android. Can select rooms and see the layout easily. Drawing rooms works great as well!  Robotiness? It makes all the noises a robot vacuum should and it's awesome! Just thought you should know! Beep boop boop!  Ratings: I give it 5 stars because as it is a robot vacuum, it meets all of my expectations. 4 stars on deep cleaning and suction because it isn't perfect, but is excellent as a robot vacuum. I haven't used my regular vacuum in the areas that this one runs because it seems to do such a great job. Integration with Google works great! I don't use Alexa with this one. Again, this is one of the best purchases I made this year. Definitely recommend this vacuum to everyone.

My floors look great.', 'body': \"I had been browsing robot vacuums for some time and finally took the plunge on Prime Day. It was easy to set up out of the box, the robot vac is configured with an app on your phone. Steve McClean needed time to charge before he could map the floor plan. I bought Steve for the upstairs which is wall to wall carpet with tile in the bathrooms and laundry room, and a week later added Rosie for the downstairs, which is all hardwood with throw rugs. I followed Steve on his first mapping mission and was impressed that he figured out the stairs on his own. I couldn’t fully decipher the map of the floor plan he produced on the first go round to set up no go areas, I did that step after a few runs when I had completed job maps to compare with. Steve did a great job on all floors the first time out. I had vacuumed with my Shark upright ahead of time and I was amazed by the amount of dust, hair and lint the Steve picked up. Steve goes under beds and tables the upright couldn't get to. After a few cleaning sessions I purchased Rosie for the downstairs which is all hardwood floors with throw rugs. Rosie is scheduled to work every night, I love walking downstairs in the mornings to clean floors. Through the app I was able to set up both robots to specify rooms and no-go areas on the floor plan, and schedule cleanings. When I had an unscheduled call during a cleaning session, I was able to use the app to pause Steve until the call was over. I allowed the app to send notifications to my phone and have received notifications for low battery when the robots are accidentally bumped off their docks and a notification that Rosie was going to fall off a cliff. Turns out she was just tied up in some cords. She stayed there all night until her battery died. Cords are a challenge for the robot vacuums, it has forced me to put away any cords that are not in use and organize those that are. I’m still working on identifying and setting those areas up as no-go. I work at home during the day and have set up Steve’s cleaning times for when I don’t have calls scheduled. The vacuuming itself isn’t particularly loud but the emptying when going to the docking station is. The robots dock themselves for emptying and charging. I had to move Steve to a lower traffic area, so he wasn’t getting bumped and taken off the charger. Overall, I am thrilled to have automated the cleaning of my floors.

Because we have it, we are mindful of cords, cat toys and other items on the floor that could tangle it up, so its presence also kind of enforces a level of tidiness.  This machine does not learn quickly, it is not using satellites and cameras to map the shifting topography of our home, and I am happy with that. What it does is wander from room to room in an apparently random fashion, and it always finds dirt. It eventually seems to go over the entire floor. We have two cats who find it loud and unpleasant, but also fascinating. They stalk it from covert locations, calculating the balance of the predator/prey relationship. Someday, they may attack it, but if that happens, I think the Roomba will survive.  Cons: Somewhat loud - It is as loud as a normal vacuum cleaner Needs supervision - It can't be left running home alone, because it gets stuck under furniture from time to time. It sometimes makes mistakes that could endanger its life. I block it from entering areas where it could fall off of a cliff, because in spite of the cliff detection feature, I think it might very well fall off a cliff if given the chance. Only one phone allowed - The phone app seems to allow for only one phone per user, so only one member of the household can command the vacuum from the phone app; not a big deal for me because I just push the button on the top of the Roomba and it takes off. Pros: It vacuums the house frequently. I am never going to do that. It has the work quality of maybe a ten year old who was asked to vacuum the house--but unlike a ten year old, it is persistent.

I bought this Roomba to replace my old Ecovacs Deebot N79S, which had started to show its age (earlier than I thought) and stopped cleaning like it used to in the beginning. I made my decision to buy this Roomba based on the reviews, high ratings, and a holiday discount at Amazon. It had much higher rating than the Ecovacs Deebot model I had. It was a wrong decision and here\\'s why:  I don\\'t see much difference between the cleanings this Roomba and the old Deebot did (when it was younger, that is). Surely, the Roomba has more suction power, but it\\'s not a better vacuum cleaner for what one must pay for it excluding the holiday discount I got.  The Roomba is so loud that it rivals my upright vacuum cleaner in that respect. The Deebot was much much quieter. For instance, I didn\\'t have to stop that while I was on the phone. This, I must.  I know these mid-level (and low) model robo-vacuums do not have the best programming embedded in them to do \"smart(er)\" cleaning, but on an equal level, the old Deebot was much smarter than this new Roomba. I have to say this is dumber. I even started verbally arguing with the thing. I rarely spoke to the Deebot. The days of meaningful silent conversations with my robot cleaner have been long over. :-P  This vacuum cleaner is also very forceful; when it hits an object (e.g., a pot sitting on top of a plant stand), it may knock it down. Luckily I was always near my plants when such accident almost happened; I had to \"gently [honest!]\" guide the cleaner to somewhere else though it kept wanting to come back. It\\'s unnecessarily fast and forceful. It gets more confused than the Deebot did when detecting gaps and obstacles. When this Roomba hits my office chair while I\\'m sitting in it, it moves both of us for an inch or two. And, no, I\\'m not that light and I\\'m not joking. What kind of motor did they put in it?  This Roomba always has hard time finding its home base. No, the base is not in an obscured place. When it is running low on battery, it doesn\\'t seem to power down. It keeps cleaning--as loud and fast it was when it started its job--while looking for its home, which sounds like a great idea for maximizing the amount of cleaning, but then it ends up depleting whatever the charge remaining in its battery and finds itself dead somewhere in the house. I don\\'t remember how many times I had to carry it back to its home. The old Deebot didn\\'t have the same difficulty finding its own home base (which was where I placed the new Roomba\\'s) and it powered down when its battery was low. It quietly looked for it and didn\\'t bother with cleaning, which was done already anyway. I am not saying the Deebot never had difficulty in this respect, but it wasn\\'t as consistently bad as the Roomba.  I don\\'t care much for the seemingly-fancy smartphone app one \"must\" use to operate this Roomba either. I guess it\\'s nice to have features like getting a notification when it\\'s stuck or when it\\'s time to clean out its bin, operating it remotely, and setting its cleaning schedule with ease, but these features quickly turned into non-factors after I had time seeing the cleaner in action. The old Deebot didn\\'t have any of these features--I had to use its rudimentary non-that-remote control device to set anything or control it, but I was happier with the job it performed, which matters more.  Also, this Roomba didn\\'t come with a kit that provided extra side brush(es), filter(s)/bin(s), or other parts that need to be changed periodically. The old Deebot came with a kit that provided extra of the same. It\\'s my mistake to assume that the Roomba (for this price) would provide extra parts (at least an extra side brush would be nice as it\\'s one of the first things to go).  So, all in all, I do not recommend iRobot Roomba 692. After our one-way toxic conversations (monologs, that is) reach to their detrimental peak, I\\'m sending this away (I\\'ll probably donate it with a note on it saying that I wasn\\'t happy with it, but someone else who likes conversations with a strong vacuum while it\\'s shouting might -or- drop it off the town\\'s garbage disposal/convenience center without a word).  Lastly, one might think that I\\'m recommending Deebot, which could have easily been any other brand. I am not. I used my experience with it as a baseline, which in turn I used to judge Roomba\\'s performance in the same house with the same obstacle course. You may already have or get a Deebot and dislike it because your expectations are different than mine. My review is based on my own experience with both. What I put here is merely my opinion. Your mileage may vary, as they say.', 'rating': 2, 'helpfulVotes': 40, 'reviewer': {'name': 'B.B.'}}, {'title': \"Tips if you're thinking about a Roomba (updated)\", 'body': 'Here are a few tips if you\\'re thinking about getting a Roomba (which you should!)  1. Wait until Prime Day or an equivalent sale. I bought this model for $220 (tax included). If you live in the Seattle area, watch out for the Amazon deals - Amazon vans will park random places for one day only to offload products at a steep discount. The Roomba is a regular for that rotation - I\\'ve seen this model sold for $140.  2. Do not buy cheap knockoff versions for replacement parts on Amazon. Buy only iRobot products (from them directly if possible). There are a lot of versions of fake products from Chinese companies sold on Amazon. These parts are crappy and could impact the performance / lifetime of your Roomba. One example of that is the replacement air filters. The cheaper versions do not seal correctly, so dust gets into the small cracks and other mechanisms within the machine. Replacing your vaccum will cost a lot more than a $10 air filter.  3. Clean your air filter with a toothbrush after each use to reduce the clog of dust. Replace the filter every 3 months.  4. Do a deep cleaning of your Roomba every 6 months. Use a mini flathead and a small phillips to take off the front cover (you\\'ll need to take off the small, yellow spinning brush first using the small flathead). Be careful because the threads of the tiny screw are mounted in plastic casing. Very easy to strip. Clean out all the hair around the small screw that attaches the spinning brush (after 6 months, this can cause the brush to stop spinning - 90% of the time, it\\'s just hair - side note - this motor is also replacable for only $15 on the iRobot website).  I\\'ve noticed a fair amount of negative reviews discussing the shelf life of Roombas. People are making comments like \"My cats killed our Roomba\" etc. I\\'d like to set the record straight for this awesome company. Basically, in life, you can\\'t get things for free. You can\\'t expect your car, for instance, to function well over time without regular maintainence. Most people hate car maintanance, so it has become widely accepted for most people to pay someone to fix / clean their car. And, for most people this makes a lot of sense. We\\'d rather spend our time doing other things besides changing the oil, checking the tires, checking the radiator, maintaining the engine and so on.  For vaccums, the mechanics are much less complex than a car. However, they still incur a ton of wear and tear like dirt, cat hair, female hair, dust, and eveything else that lands on the floor. Over time, even the best vaccum will break or need repairs if it is not well maintained. In the old days, we had vaccum repair shops because people hated working on their vaccums. Then, everything possible became automated and outsourced. We could have Roomba repair shops that cost $30 to do a tune up of your Roomba. People would probably pay it. But, rest assured, the same people complaining about paying for that would be the same people who complained about the amazing Roomba - the vaccum that does its job with very little work from the human. The only thing is doesn\\'t do well is clean itself. What we need is a cat Roomba.  My closing thought is this one. Spend one hour every three months maintaining your Roomba, and you will save yourself 50+ hours a year (a whole work week) of vaccuming. That\\'s very simple math, but it will require some effort on the part of the human. I purchased mine on Prime Day 8 months ago. I did my first deep clean (along with the regular air filter cleaning with each use) and she is gently purring like the first day I discovered her :-).

In our sitting room, it covered one area five times, but then left two other areas untouched (see pictures). 2. There are two side brushes sweeping material to the center, but no surface brush to sweep the surface clean. After 60 minutes of vacuuming, there was a slight film of dust even in the areas it had covered. 3. It is slightly taller than our previous one, and therefore could not get under all the furniture.

The rest of the story: The technology is simply remarkable, but not perfect. But spectacularly impressive.  What do I (you) want from a robotic vacuum? * Good quality of vacuuming of a variety of surfaces. Check. * Recognition of hard floor vs rug/carpet. Check * Smart mapping of the area and obstacles. Check. * Large object collision detection. Check. * Smart detection of cords and small objects. Fail. * Stairway/hazard detection. Check. * Automated emptying of the collection bin. Check. * Smart application control. Check.  Now the details.  Cleaning of hardwood floors (loose material), rugs and carpet with low and deep pile is very good based on the material in the collection bin. The pattern of cleaning is very orderly and efficient. You should still periodically use an upright vacuum on carpets and rugs because it cannot deep clean, but the robot is great in between major cleanings to keep the areas looking good. I didn\\'t get the mop version of the robot because it was 2X expensive and there are all kinds of issues with washing and drying the mop. I can do the mopping by hand, thank you.  There were lots of independent tests indicating that 70% of hair would be wrapped around the brush. My experience with prolific deposition of medium length human hair is very different: 90% goes into the bin.  The LIDAR technology of mapping is certainly superior to the camera-only technology of the iRobot and other competitors. You can watch it map out room features 20\\' away. This works really well for furniture, walls and big objects. However, it will gobble up cords and other small objects in a nanosecond. Some of the \"S\" versions of the Roborock incorporate cameras which will certainly improve the small object detection. Meanwhile, with the Q5, pick up the room ahead of cleaning; and use the application to exclude areas from cleaning that have cords or other things that will be ingested.  Be prepared for it to gently \"kiss\" chair legs, base boards and other objects. The vast majority of times it will not move these larger objects (excluding shoes, etc). So far I haven\\'t seen any impact damage, but some people report that the rotating brush mars baseboards.  The application allows you to map out more than one floor of your house, and define rooms. This allows for selective cleaning of specific rooms, either on demand (and integrated with Amazon Alexa), or as part of a routine schedule. Sections within rooms can be excluded from cleaning (such as cords). Virtual walls can be drawn to define boundaries. When physically moving the robot from one level to another it takes a minute for the vacuum to establish the level and room. So far, all of the features have worked very well.  Message to developers: the docking station should have a way to directly broadcast its location to the robot, such as an IR emitter. When the robot is physically moved by a human, it may take several minutes for the robot to determine the physical location AND the location of the docking station.  The Bottom Line: This is a remarkable piece of technology. It has minor flaws, but the positive attributes are overwhelming. I would not pay 2X for the mopping technology; however, the small object detection of the \"S\" version may be of benefit to you (but not to me).  This has a tremendous value for the cost.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 161, 'reviewer': {'name': 'J McAfee'}}, {'title': 'Fantastic robot vacuum', 'body': \"I don't write very many reviews but this robot vacuum deserves a review. Absolutely amazed. I have two early iteration, bump and turn Roombas that work very well but are getting tired. Decided to replace with a smart robot vacuum. The Roborock Q5+ Robot Vacuum with Self-Empty Dock had many good reviews. Boxed very well. No trouble getting it to connect to my wifi. Charged up for the night and sent it cleaning the next day. Amazing how it mapped out the whole house as it did its first vacuum. It did get stuck once on some wires under the bed but was able to find it on the map. As it wandered around, mapping and cleaning, it would skip half of some of the rooms. I thought I was going to have to force it to find the rest of the missed areas. No worry, it eventually went back and discovered the missing areas. Love how you can see where the vacuum is and where it has cleaned on the map. I easily divided up the map into separate rooms so I can tell the vacuum to work on one or two rooms at a time. Picked up a huge amount of dirt and cat hair that the Roombas missed. The Roborock maneuvered around furniture very well and looking at the map, made sure every area of the house was vacuumed. It runs around the perimeter of the room and then systematically ran in straight lines in the middle of the room. The app is so easy to use and the mapping was excellent. Even though the internal dust bin was well packed with dirt, the self emptying charging base completely emptied the robot with a big thawoop. When emptying, it is noisy but it was to be expected. It is a vacuum and vacuums are generally loud. I set the robot to automatically empty when finished. Noticed the next day when I told it to only do two rooms, that is didn't automatically empty. I pushed the empty button and it warned me that it would be loud and did I want to proceed. All in all I am very impressed. Cleans well, maps the house well, the app is very easy to use. Hopefully it lasts a long time. Very happy.  Update on Roborock Q5+ After using about six times I have a few comments. We have hardwood floors with very short pile oriental rugs. The Roborock tends to get stuck transitioning from wood floor across the rug fringe. Not too much of a problem as the Roborock figures it out. Another thing compared to old Roomba, the Roomba has duel rubber rollers where the Roborock has a single brush/rubber roller. I ran the old Roomba after running the Roborock and the Roomba does a much better job picking up the cat hair/fuzz than the Roborock. Think that deeper pile carpet wouldn't have this issue.  Still give the Roborock five stars but now wish I had gotten the dual rubber roller Roborock. They are more expensive and I don't want mopping ability.

Roborock Pros: - Better price! Honestly, if you’re at all sensitive to price, just go with the RoboRock - Less noisy. Both the vacuum itself makes less noise than my old Roomba, and also it does a lot less of hard bumping into things. I wouldn’t let Roomba run when the baby is sleeping, but I do let Roborock - Better mapping. The first time, Roborock mapped my whole house in less than an hour. It also seems to have a better intuitive grasp on what is a wall vs furniture than my Roomba did - Fewer jams. - More communicative. App shows exactly the cleaning path, where the robot is, and gives verbal cues so you know what it’s up to  Comparable performance - Roborock and Roomba seemed to do about the same on actual vacuuming and getting stuck on things (I have an ikea rocker that trips up both of them) - map/schedule functionality. Both apps work fine - I don’t really have a preference for one over the other.  Things I miss about Roomba - ABILITY TO RESTORE MAPS! This item alone is the reason I can’t give a 5-star review. Both Roomba and Roborock distort the map over time, creating random phantom zones outside the perimeter of the house. However, Roomba’s app allows you to revert to a previous version of the map (as long as you catch it within 30 days). With Roborock, once your map gets messed up, you have no option but to delete the whole map and start again from scratch. Incredibly annoying! - Smarthome integration. I miss being able to tell Google home to vacuum a room. If this is possible to setup with Roborock, I haven’t figured out how (with Roomba it was pretty seamless)  Overall, I’m pretty happy with my RoboRock.

It finally got so it couldn\\'t even leave the base. Have started a return/exchange. Will try another one and hopefully the 2nd one will last. Lowered rating since it only lasted a few days and will return it to a 4 star if the replacement works without errors.  I first purchased a Roomba J7+ but returned it because it was not able to maneuver properly and was always stuck. So, I decided to try the Roborock Q5 Max +. I wanted to provide some obvious differences between the two with some comparisons shown below. I would have given it 5 stars but it is still a little large to be able to maneuver closely around some obstacles (chairs, TVs, etc). This is an issue with all Robot vacuums, not just the Roborock. Weekly manually vacuuming in the hard to reach places is still required. Roborock Q5 Max + compared to iRobot Roomba J7+: Roborock Q5 Max + (will be referred to as \"Dusty\") mapped in 7 minutes. J7+ took over 2 hours with 2 recharges. The mapping very closely resembles my floorplan. The J7 did not, it was not even close to as good as Dusty\\'s map. Dusty is much quieter while cleaning than J7. The auto empty is loud but not as loud as the J7. The Roborock App shows exact map and path that Dusty takes and where it currently is. J7 app indicates which room it is in but does not show the path that the vacuum took. Dusty has setting that allows the auto empty to be turned off. J7 does not. So Dusty can be used while sleeping if auto empty is off. J7 would need to run during times when no one is sleeping or napping due to extremely loud auto empty noise. Dusty was able to make it around my bar stool chairs. J7 could not, it would climb up on the legs and get stuck. My chairs now have scratches on the legs from J7\\'s repeated (failed) attempts to work itself free. Dusty was able to quickly determine that it cannot climb my platform chair and ottoman. It still tried but got itself released quickly. J7 never figured that out and it took several minutes for the J7 to release itself from the platforms. Dusty did not have problems on the base of my tower fan. J7 always got stuck on the base. Dusty has a slightly larger diameter than the J7 so it was not able to go between the kitchen chair legs from all directions, but it was able to approach from the side and clean under the table. The J7 could, but it bounced around a lot in doing so. Dusty does the peripheral of each room first and then the interior. This prevents it from having to bump against the wall with each pass. J7 does not have that logic. Dusty has a more organized grid style path whereas J7 did a lot of bouncing around even though it has mapping capabilities. This allows Dusty to finish in less than half the time of the J7. Dusty takes 70 minutes to complete my 1200 Sq Ft main floor. Battery after completion is at around 60% so could easily do a much larger area. J7 required at least one and sometimes two recharges and over 2 1/2 hours (not including recharge time which was about another hour) to complete the 1200 Sq Ft area. I only have area rugs and Dusty does a good job on them. I have read reviews about the J7 being better at deep cleaning carpet but I can\\'t comment on that since I don\\'t have carpet. But I am pleased with how well Dusty does my large area rugs. Overall I do recommend this model of Roborock over a Roomba. I have had two Roomba\\'s and was not pleased with either one.

This means the one disposable dust bag it comes with will fill up quickly so immediately buy dust bin bags-you will need them fast. Be sure you get the RoboRock app to set it up with. Setup is easy and essential using the app. Alexa or Google integration is a breeze. It is fairly quiet on balanced suction mode, and not really so loud on turbo. You MUST manually empty the dust bin in the Q5+ if it fills during cleaning and that is a real possibility if you have a lot of square feet. It will dock due to low battery or being full and upon docking it will empty by itself. However if during its cleaning cycle, it gets full, it will not sense this nor return to dock to empty. You MUST empty the dust bin-easy enough to do using the app. Dust bin contents are sucked into the dust bin back when docked and you manually choose empty dust bin. You have to let it run and do its thing. The best thing: set room mapping up and let it run around to map your floor. Then it will clean. Doing mapping first is easy and fast. You have to save maps of rooms/floors by setting save on-you toggle it to \"on\" and then you map. You can set up tasks meaning you can have it clean one room then go back to dock to empty and this is a good thing because it most likely will not overfill from one room and you need not manually empty it. Create three or four tasks and with each completed task, it will go back to dock and empty. If you do not do tasks, and you try to clean 1200 square feet, it WILL fill up and you MUST intervene and tell it to go back to dock to empty it. I run it 2x a day for 1200 feet and no matter what I do, it fills up before it is done cleaning. I have no idea where it comes from but the bin gets full about half way through. There is no way to get around this. This device picks up ever-so-fine dust, and dirt-better than with a vacuum. The big clumps of hair if you have dogs...not so much but these are visible and easily picked up after the device has left them behind during its runs. It just cleans and cleans!  Let me go back to cleaning. It does this well. I am surprised how much small stuff it picks up. It picks up dog hair, etc. well. It seems to pick up dirt I cannot even see or notice. With a full charge, you may get 1200 square feet; I do with about 15% battery left. If not, it will go back to charge on the dock when it gets to 19% low. My plan: let it work using tasks (you can set a room or floor schedule) and let it charge and by the morning, empty the dust bin by using that option via the app, and let it clean again a floor where you do not have activity or where people are not at home or around (bedrooms for example). I say work it; run it daily. I have a good vac; I vacuumed Wed, and it is Sun and it is shocking to see what it has been picking up in the dust bin. If you have a dog or cat, this is the move. I am not saying it will pick up long hair but the short hair and dander, yes it 100% will. It cleans under the beds (yay!) and under furniture where it fits. It is not an industrial vac. It most likely won\\'t and should not be used to pick up wood chips, etc. around a wood stove, nor should it be used to pick up large particulate matter. It does pick up coins without any noise or damage so that it great if you miss a coin on the carpet or floor. I can use Alexa (\"Alexa, tell Roborock to empty the dust bin\" or \"Alexa, tell Roborock to start cleaning\" or \"Alexa, tell Roborock to dock\") for basic commands. If you have a spill, you will have to experiment to get the unit to clean it up; it looks like if you press the home button on the device, it cleans within a 10-foot radius. It will just try to clean in rows so you will just have to try it out for spot cleaning. It may be a pain to get it to do that. I can\\'t imagine people with pets not having this or one of the Roomba pet hair cleaning units. This is going to save me so much work. I am not getting any younger. I thought \"Why deny myself technology?\" so I got it on sale. I highly recommend meaning for me it matched my expectations and needs and easily so.  One last thing: the roller will clog with wrap-around hair. It is easy to take out and clean BUT you MUST put the roller brush cover on exactly meaning there are four tabs and two go in manually at a bit of an angle and the other side of the roller brush cover has two clips that go back into place when you pinch them. IF you see any of the four tabs, you do not have it in place correctly. This shows up when you try to empty the unit. It will not empty. You will hear it try but it will not because the suction is too low because the roller brush cover is not completely installed/inserted. You may find the unit telling you you are attempting too many empty commands and it will ignore your commands to empty the dust bin if you find you had the roller brush cover on loosely. The way around this is to take out the dust bin and with a flashlight locate the reset hole (use a pin). It is well-hidden. When you find it, put in the button while also holding the home or power button. This resets the device. You have to readd your unit to wifi (not 5 but 2.4) and be sure your phone\\'s wifi for this is on the 2.4 band. Reattach the unit to your 2.4 wifi and you will be good to go. The unit will start recognizing the empty command and with the roller brush cover on correctly (no tabs showing), you will see the unit empty its dust bin. All maps, etc. are saved in the app. Only the unit gets reset. The bags are really easy to change. I filled that \"7-week\" bag in a week. That is how good the unit is. I have run it 3x a day and I still pick up dirt. I have no idea how or why but I do breathe easier now without any decongestants, and the house is clean! Any vacuum clogs and needs cleaning. This unit is no different. It is maintenance. After a week or so, you get the hang of it.  I did not get the combo mop unit because I can do that with another machine. I wanted a dust bin that was 100% for dirt pickup. It works. It works well. I am getting another for the second floor with carpet and with carpet, the unit senses this and goes into turbo mode to clean. For hardwood, it does not have to do that. There are four speeds. Night is quietest. Balanced is good. I like that setting. The wrap-up: run this a couple of times a day (why not?) and pause your cleaning via the app after 30 minutes or so to return it to dock and empty. Or use tasks. No one is going to get 1200 square feet cleaned in one pass without emptying. That is a good thing. This device picks up! For real!', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 188, 'reviewer': {'name': 'D.

I previously did a review of the iRobot j7+ here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24FTVN143ZHG2?ref=pf_ov_at_pdctrvw_srp  We purchased this Q5+ machine and received it April 12, 2023 (with the help of a $200 save coupon). We rate this 4.7 starts, but since I can't select that, I rounded.  --------------------------------------- ADDITIONAL ADDED: 7/28/2023:  Still LOVE this robot vacuum. - Does a great job on the dog fur and almost all other stuff. (once and a while will find a random large leaf or something else to pick up, but it's rare.) - The vacuum power AND completion time is awesome. - Only had to change the base bag one time so far. I did let it go as long as possible (a little over 2 months for me with major fur) so it gave an error emptying. I removed the bag, then used regular upright vacuum hose to empty the tube in the base, put new bag on, and good to go. Want: - Asked devs for the app to add a way to assign room order, but for now I have just divided my floor into (2) jobs. ---------------------------------------  Our use: - We got it to help us keep up with dog fur, as once a week (even twice) is not enough for our 85 lb. yellow lab. - About 1,163 sq. foot main level, mostly hardwood, 2 rooms with carpet. One room's carpet is high pile. - We like to run it 2-3 times a week. - We keep it clean and maintained as recommended.  The overall cleaning: - The entire main floor is cleaned in about 1hr 45mins, compared to varying 5-8 hours with j7. ---- Able to clean all in a single charge, single empty, as opposed to j7 needing 2-3 recharges and 4-6 empties. - The suction power is far superior to the j7. No more fur left in lines along borders between carpet and wood floor. - The carpet actually looks vacuumed well and standing up, not just matted down wheel tracks. We never really noticed before with the j7, but it's obvious now. - The hardwood floor has noticeably less fur left behind. I'm guessing the higher suction is able to remove fur slightly stuck to the floor from drying there or static charge.  The good: - The LiDAR navigation and mapping is excellent. ---- The initial mapping of the entire floor took 14 minutes, allowing rooms and zones setup. ---- The robot does not crash into walls and furniture, like the j7. There are occasional small bumps while getting close with the side brush. ---- Setting no-go zones is easy, and orders of magnitude more accurate than the j7. ---- Robot is able to locate where it is at all times. It did get stuck under the corner of a couch once, but I was able to pull it out, and it continued about the job. A little no-go zone at that corner fixed the issue. The j7 would have been completely lost and have to start over. ---- The vacuuming pattern is sensible and thorough, not random. Does outer borders with edge brush facing out, then vacuums back and forth covering all spaces. Any inner items like table legs also get a border cleaning with edge brush. ---- The map gets updated in real time where the robot currently is, and shows the path it has taken for the entire cleaning routine. ---- You can set new no-go zones during a cleaning cycle. The robot will simply pause until you confirm it.  The OK: - The UI in the app for creating room dividers and such was not very intuitive, however a couple youtube videos and comments solved that. - I would like to be able to set the order of rooms for a full clean, or make a routine where room selection order matters. I currently only see the ability to create tasks within a routine, but the robot empties after each task, so making a task for each room or small groups of rooms is not what I'm really looking for. Could be PEBKAC.  The bad: - It does still leave some skid marks on the wood floor, but I expected that it would. Seems to be fewer than j7. Still come up with socked foot.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 115, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Jay'}}, {'title': 'Buy the Q5 DuoRoller+', 'body': 'I have read multiple robot vacuum reviews and watched countless comparison videos. This is my 3rd robot vac in 6 years. The cleaning area is a mix of tile, luxury vinyl flooring, one low pile area rug, and multiple bathroom rugs.  For everyone who bought the Q5, Q5+ you should have bought the Q5 DuoRoller+. We got it on sale for 50% the list price which was a deal!!!!  It was packed solidly in the boxes, set up was a breeze with the quick sheet instructions, and voice prompts!  After a week of use, we are very impressed with this Roborock Q5 DuoRoller+ Robot Vacuum with Self-Empty Dock compared to the other robots that we have had. • It is very quiet compared to what we are used to. • The app is phenomenal, you can see were it cleaned and where it is in live action. • It cleans the entire house 1,593 sq ft in 2 hours 24 minutes instead of 1,243 sq ft in 4 hours 25 minutes and it does not miss anything or get stuck. • Room lights do not have to be left on for it see what it is doing. • The automatic empty is completed automatically after every cleaning and the dust bin does not have anything in it, not even dust. • It picks up cat litter and pet hair compared to what we are used to. • We no longer have to pick up all of the bathroom rugs as it knows how to go over them without getting stuck. • It’s refreshing to not have every job canceled before it is completed.  Previous robots: • #1 Roomba 960, was replaced after 4 years because it has to be the dumbest robot on the planet. Constantly gets stuck, took hours to clean in its drunken pattern, and still missed stuff. It really enjoys being stuck under the corners of furniture. I moved it to a bonus room and it still gets stuck.  • #2 Roomba i8+ (self-emptying), was replaced after 1 year because it was damaged while we were out of town, it was on a schedule and it got into something. But this guy always had challenges with staying connected to the wi-fi, returning to the dock, charging itself, it was very loud, did an okay job cleaning, had to set up multiple boundaries because it also liked being stuck under corners of furniture. Fortunately it had an accident that gave me the opportunity to try the Roborock Q5 DuoRoller+ Robot Vacuum with Self-Empty Dock.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 32, 'reviewer': {'name': 'NA'}}, {'title': 'Just okay, self clean is great', 'body': 'I had my eye on this for a long time and grabbed two of them when they were on a crazy sale. I used to have an original Rumba, without self cleaning. It was pretty dumb, always got stuck, and I found myself caring more for the Rumba than it cared for me.  The RoboRock thinks it is smarter. But even though it maps out the home, it is definitely not housekeeper quality. It doesn\\'t go back and forth in lines like humans do, so it\\'s zooming all over the place, making my house\\'s map look like a 3-year-old\\'s crayon drawing.  I\\'ll give pros and cons, but first let\\'s clear up some misconceptions:  --The RoboRock does NOT need the app and does NOT need a wifi connection. All you do is press the power button and off it goes. You can send it back to the dock by pressing the house icon, or you can wait until it thinks it\\'s finished and goes back on its own.  --If you do set up the app, pay attention to what you are accepting. You don\\'t have to accept the option to send all your info back to its marketing people. You can decline.  --When the app and device are connected, they are NOT connected to the internet. In your wifi settings, you\\'ll notice that the device shows \"not connected to internet.\" Unless, of course, you gave it permission during setup. It doesn\\'t need external internet. It needs your local network only.  Now for the pros and cons.  Pros: Self emptying - best feature ever. It has powerful suctioning most of the time. It can climb over most low objects, like the trim between rooms or when moving from hardwood to carpet. I didn\\'t plan to use the app, but I finally downloaded it and I like that I can tell the robot to go back to the dock when I\\'m tired of listening to it flail around the house. You can change the language for which it speaks. It does clean better than a Rumba. The spinning sweeper is longer than most robot vacuums so the reach under things and in corners is better. Bags. I love that it uses vacuum bags because there is nothing more disgusting than emptying out a vacuum tank and ending up covered in dust.  Cons: My biggest complaint is that it thinks it\\'s stuck when it bumps into a piece of furniture. It\\'s not tangled in anything. It just can\\'t move forward. Instead of backing up the way it came, it stops and calls out \"Error, remove the obstacle or move the robot.\" So I would either have to lift my couch out of the way for the robot\\'s convenience or I have to move the robot to somewhere else. This is where it is just as dumb as the Rumba. At least the Rumba gets legitimately stuck under the couch. This robot isn\\'t stuck. It\\'s just lazy and annoyed. But it is a real problem, because if I have to get up (say, while I am working) to cater to the vacuum, then I may as well use a real vacuum and do it right. If I am away from home and have the robot on a schedule, what am I supposed to do? The robot will just sit there in the corner, not cleaning, draining the battery, and not emptying itself. That is a major fail.  I also have issue with the way it approaches lighter objects. It can\\'t pick up a twist tie but it\\'ll drag my bath rug all around the house. If it is programmed to sense walls and things, why can\\'t it learn to leave behind things it can\\'t pick up? Why is it pushing my cat bowl around instead of mapping it as a light piece of furniture.  Cleaning quality is not great, especially on hard floors. It leaves a lot of crumbs and dirt behind, often traveling around it rather than over it. I even picked the robot up and placed it on top of the kitchen crumbs, but it took off into another room instead. I used a broom instead. But it does often bypass areas altogether, which is annoying. On hard floors, it also spits some of the dirt back out its back end.  Gets tangled in wires. You would think that by the year 2024, someone would teach these vacuum robots to disentangle themselves from wires and shoelaces. Nope, it sucks in the wires, internet cables, shoelaces and pulls and pulls and pulls until I get up (again!) and pull them back out. Really dumb.  Does not really handle hair well. A lot of reviewers are praising this robot for dealing with shedding animals. Yes, it\\'ll clean up the hair, but then the hair gets tangled in the roller. There\\'s no feature to cut the hair from the roller, so that leaves you flipping the robot over and cutting the hair manually. The manufacturers went through the trouble of having the robot empty itself. Why wouldn\\'t they have a hair trimmer feature too?  At the sale price I paid, I think I\\'d only recommend this vacuum to people with small uncluttered apartments with mostly carpet. I\\'d never pay the full $800 for it. Not worth it.

It doesn’t have geo-fencing and related functionalities; or water refilling at the base, but you’ll only find these in robots costing three times as much, so it’s not even a fair comparison. This robot has very good specifications and functionality. Battery autonomy for roughly 2 hours of operation; and a water tank for about 30 minutes (more below). It also includes a charging base and the robot can automatically park into it. I’ve had it for two weeks and I’m very happy with it.  Breaking it down: this is my honest experience with this robot, the Vipsun Z1, and I’ll lay it out like I’d like to have read before buying, with all the important info about how it works from the user’s perspective.  Instructions in the box contain graphics detailing all parts and accessories. They’re simple, and contain everything you need to know to assemble the robot’s parts.  The link for the app goes to their website, but I highly recommend you find it on Google or Apple stores (app is “ROPVACNIC”), because apps are vetted there (security) and you’ll also be able to get updates; while a manual install from their website will be static and not update.  The only initial setup is wi-fi. For me this step worked without issues. Instructions also include troubleshooting, should the connection fail; and alternative ways to connect, which is very thoughtful, especially if you’re not very tech-savvy.  Unboxing it, you just need to put the brushes in place, the dust box with air filter/refillable water tank and the pad with the mop on it – that’s it!  Included are also: an extra pair of brushes; an air filter (consumables); and an IR remote that allows for all basic operations: power on/off, select automatic, manual and other working and send to charge.  To start, just put water in the tank, power it on, select automatic mode and it just goes and does its thing – it doesn’t get any simpler than that; even granny will love it!  The app has added functionalities and works also when you’re not home: seeing robot status, running time, battery percentage and any error. You can change vacuum power (high/mid/silent) and water rate (high/mid/low/off); see consumables life; and “find my robot”. You can set schedules with: starting hour, day(s), water (on/off); and recurrence.  Battery lasts for about 2 hours in medium suction and water for 30 minutes in low flow. Robot stops at 15% battery to go find the charging base. Charging takes a little over 4 hours. Not draining the battery and the slow charge are good for a longer battery life span. Quicker charging isn’t really necessary, since autonomy should be enough for most houses.  Robot doesn’t have geo-fencing, so once it starts cleaning, it’ll go in random trajectories and through all open space. It has short-term obstacles and wall memory and does a very good job in going around chairs and furniture feet to ensure good cleaning; and following wall edges.  To work with the robot’s absence of geo-fencing, you can close doors to have it clean rooms individually or just hallways and adjacent areas. You can also put obstacles in door passages or hallways to limit the working area - good to keep the robot from wetting all floors (it’s random, remember?) while you’re also there.  It’s very important to get as many wires off of the way as possible. It actually does a good job in not getting stuck with them for the most part.  Sometimes, I’ve seen that the mop isn’t leaving its whole width of the floor wet, so I set the water flow to medium; it seems that the water flow isn’t exactly precise.  Since the autonomy of the water is about 1/4 that of the battery, what I do is when I want to start a run, I take the removable box from the robot, empty the dust box, manually wash the mop pad in the sink with a little dish soap, so it’s clean and already wet (for longer low water flow). I put the mop pad back in the fittings, then a little no-rinse and no-foam wood floor soap in the tank and the rest with water. Fit the mop pad in the box before filling the tank, otherwise the water will drip freely through the tank’s holes.  It has happened, though, after one or two water refills in the current cycle, to still find 30% or 40% of the water left after the 30 minutes, so I suspect that if you just keep it working continuously, it might automatically turn off the water so it lasts longer, but most times it just drains the tank in 30 minutes, so that’s what I count on.  So, there you go, that’s my personal experience with the Vipsun Z1 after two weeks, what I’ve learned about how it works and how to make it work the best for me, according to its characteristics. I’m very happy with this purchase, especially given the price and what you get for it. After you read this (wow, you made it here?!...)

The vacuum suction power is strong enough to pick up dirt, dust, and pet hair effectively, while the mop attachment effectively removes stains and leaves floors sparkling clean. The device handles both dry and wet messes without any issues, maintaining consistent cleaning performance throughout.  Another feature worth mentioning is its low maintenance. The removable dustbin and washable mop pads are easy to clean, ensuring the device is always ready for the next cleaning session.  Overall, the Vacuum and Mop Control device has exceeded my expectations. It combines functionality with convenience in a way that has simplified my cleaning routine and enhanced the cleanliness of my home. If you're looking for a versatile cleaning solution that saves time and effort, I highly recommend giving this device a try.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 4, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Ravi'}}, {'title': 'Great!!', 'body': 'This is a great robot vacuum!

Very Widespread Problem.\", 'body': 'UPDATED 7.13.2022: About 4 months ago, my Shark deleted the map it made of my house. That\\'s what it uses to efficiently clean the house and it lets you design \"No Vaccuum Zones\" such as under your table where it gets lost for hours trying to navigate chair legs, or where that rug is that is really plush and prevents the robot from getting up onto it. Anyway, I\\'ve remapped and re-set up my rooms and no-go zones multiple times only for the app to delete them again. I\\'ve read online that it\\'s a very common problem, but good luck getting anyone in Support to look at it.  Without this functionality, it\\'s just another dumb robot. Don\\'t waste your time buying it for the \"Mapping\" functionality. _________________________________________________________________________  I\\'ve been rocking at Roombak 699 for many years. Three batteries, countless brushes, and a new dustbin lever later, and I knew it was time for an upgrade.  I purchased this Shark unit, not really knowing what to expect. I should have done this a long time ago.  Let\\'s start with the obvious: - The Shark unit has a predictable cleaning pattern. Once it has run several times, it\\'ll create a decent map of your house. You\\'ll want to go in and create \"rooms\" or \"zones\" so you can tell it where you want it to clean (or don\\'t). You can also create \"no go zones\" without having to stick those infrared, battery powered units all over the place. Once this is all set up, this unit will clean your house--taking as long as it takes. For my house, that usually means going back to the home unit to dump its collector a couple of times. Every now and then, it needs to recharge. Roomba didn\\'t do that. It would zig and zag back and forth until it ultimately just lost charge and maybe it cleaned everything, but probably not.  - My Roomba was really loud. So loud, you couldnt\\' work or watch TV or carry on a conversation with it running. My kids even asked me not to run it at night because it woke them up (and it was downstairs and they were upstairs). The Shark unit is at least half as quiet so we don\\'t mind running it when we\\'re all here working or just putzing around.  - How well does it clean? Maybe not as well, but that is made up for by the fact that it can climb over rugs and clean the entire house in one day versus maybe it takes 2-3 days with the Roomba and it gets stuck on half a dozen things, including \"cliffs\" that aren\\'t cliffs.  We have a mix of hard floors and fairly thick-pile carpet.  If you\\'re wondering if it\\'s worth saving a few hundred dollars on a Shark and \"trying it out,\" you should go for it.

Hard to clean though.', 'body': 'Edit: Shark found a chunk of puppy poo and scooped it up so efficiently that I had a hard time finding the spot it came from. However. Shark was EXTREMELY difficult to clean. My old Roomba had parts that popped right out, easily cleaned and sent back on the road. I spent a better part of 20 minutes with a scrub brush trying to clean the Shark out. I can\\'t take out the roller without a tiny screwdriver. The wheels have divots in them for traction, and guess where all the poo was? Instead of having a smooth underside where the dust bin comes out, it is grooved for no apparent reason. Had to take a point off because being able to clean it is important.  I only got this yesterday, set it up, and charged it. When it reached 50%, it went out and did a mapping run. The rooms and dimensions were clearly visible on the app. This morning, I set it to start out at 8 am, and it did. The app said it would take about 80 minutes to clean the portions of my house available to it. It did a formidable job of getting rid of all the pet hair. I have four dogs and my daughters have between them 5 cats that shed like snow storms, all the time. There were balls of hair in every corner of the house. Shark got almost every one of them, and it had been several days since we have had a vacuum.  I had a Roomba for about 3 years, and it did okay, but you couldn\\'t get it to do any discernable pattern, it just kind of wandered around, docked itself to charge back up, wandered around some more, all day long.

I despise this product with every ounce of my being. It\\'s slowly destroying me, my family and I believe it has become sentient and learned to talk - it has taken a hard stance on every conflict in the world in one endless monologue.  For real, it\\'s the absolute worst - I would love to list all the dumb things it does but every day it finds a new way to make me hate it each time I use it. For the last week, if I select 1 room of the house to vacuum - it tells me \"error, please move me to a level surface\". It\\'s docked by the way, where it put itself on a hardwood floor. So I tell it to go again? It ignores the room command and starts doing the whole house. It\\'s infuriating because it\\'s a room that takes maybe 10 minutes to FULLY vacuum and I\\'ve spent hours just trying to get this thing to do something useful.  My overall point is...stay away.  ##### Cons: * Long hairs do get tangled on the brush, mostly in the center. Be prepared to maintain that. * The mapping feature is pretty bad, i\\'ve reset the map a few times and had it relearn, each time it\\'s different and not correct in a unique way. * The vacuum is docked in a wide open dining room, it\\'ll spend a really long time in there when it doesn\\'t get much traffic, and sometimes miss whole rooms? I don\\'t get it. * The one I received was used for like two days, kept giving me bumper errors when the bumper moved fine. I called shark and they replaced it for free. Great support at least. * It doesn\\'t really get the edges well. Example, it will clean a hallway back and forth the short way side to side rather than long way which doesn\\'t let it get to the edges tight, and also takes longer as it\\'s turning back and forth so many times. The map shows a long hallway, not sure why it does it the hard way. * I wish it had TWO front brushes, but this model only has a single brush on one side to sweep. If that\\'s a cost savings feature, it seems ridiculous, probably why it doesn\\'t do the edges very well. * mapping feature is dumb * doesn\\'t handle multiple floors so if you pick it up and bring upstairs/downstairs, it won\\'t know. However I can set it down and hit the clean button and it just cleans so I guess that works.  PROS * not very expensive, * set up was easy, dustbin and the emptying function work well * suction seems good, works on low pile carpets and has no problem with my apartments transition strips between rooms which are 1/4\" raised wood between sections of the floor. * app seems stable and pretty user friendly despite it\\'s processing of the maps to be super dumb.  Overall, it\\'s \"meh\". Yeah I\\'ll keep using it because it still makes my life easier but it\\'s a purchase that will define my next one - edging, hair tangles, smarter mapping, multiple floors maybe.

Did research and read all reviews, pros and cons and decided this was best for price. Ran for first time today and here are initial observations. Will update as I use it more. 1) this is not a plug and play item. I did have to spend time going around the house taping down extension cords, moving small items that can get knocked over, and marking where certain items of furniture are because apparently if an item moves from location it was at when robot mapped area it will get confused ( there were several reviews that mentioned that as an issue so I just went ahead and marked items that tend to be moved like a coffee table, and chairs (I used little pieces of a tape called “ gaffer tape” which is excellent because it holds well but doesn’t leave ANY residue when removed. Available on Amazon. 2) the model number used on amazon for this item is NOT the same as the model number on the robot, important because when calling tech support if you give this model # they don’t know what you’re talking about. 3) Had no problems setting up and connecting to wifi. 4) ran it on ECO mode because some of the reviews said it was better while it’s still mapping the house -will map it faster because battery lasts longer. I HAVE PETS therefore endless hair and debris and was impressed with suction at the ECO level which is the least strong suction setting. I Won’t try the other two modes until robot finished mapping. 5) there were a couple of areas where it got stuck but after a min or two it found its way out on its own, probably best not to help it unless it’s stuck for more time 6) it lasted 2 hrs and had to return to dock to empty itself twice (2nd time there was an issue described below. at times it seemed it wasn’t going to find its way back to dock but it did. 7) when it went through living room it missed area between sofa and coffee table, however, after doing the kitchen it went back to living room and found the missed area. 8) TWO BIG CONS: the previous model RV1000AE (apparently the one I bought is pretty new as of DEC 2020) has a SELF CLEANING BRUSH which is supposed to prevent long human hair wrap around the brush as was a feature I really wanted because this household has long haired humans , this model DOES NOT come with that. It has what they call a multi surface brush which is basically a regular bristle brush where my long hair got tangled and i had to tear, cut it off brush. Big bummer. ACCORDING to tech support one cannot buy the self cleaning brush to attach to this model. You would think Shark would make the bots so you could switch brushes if you wanted. Also, in the first 2 hr run an error message to empty the dust bin in the robot ( not the base) came up. While the bot and bristle brush did a great job of scraping the pet hair off the carpet, it bunched up in the dust bin and the base was not able to suck it up the 2nd time, I had to manually empty robot dust bin. Big bummer. 9) You need BOUNDARY STRIPS to keep bot out of areas you don’t want it. This model DOES NOT COME WITH THEM, whereas the previous model does. Chintzy move by Shark. OVERALL I am happy with it. I hope the problem with the dust bin clogging to the point of not self emptying will resolve itself after continuous use. I have both carpet and hardwood floors ( on which I have area rugs) and it has no problem transitioning from one to the other. Even though it’s not perfect I can now have a daily vacuuming of my house without me having to do it (I have a very bad back and knees and there is no way I could vacuum every day). As the bot is not finished mapping I haven’t tried any of the APP features-scheduling or picking a specific room to clean— I’m hoping the APP will work well because that was one of the major complaints I read in all the reviews.....the reviews I read were for the previous model because at time of purchase there was only one review for this model. As of now worth the money, it was on sale for $499 when I bought it.  12/25 update. On original review I had given it only 3 stars, now I give it 5. One of the CONS mentioned previously seems to have resolved, running it every day means less pet hair and debris so the dust bin on bot has not clogged again. still have to check brush for tangled human hair and rip/cut it off but I have to do that with normal vacs so I can live with it. Bot finished mapping house after 4.6 hrs of running ( a lot faster than what reviews had complained about). IMPORTANT, it is best to have the “CHARGE N RESUME feature on while mapping if big house, mine is 1900 sq ft, so it completes map faster. This feature does not mean the bot will re start vacuuming after it charges, it just means it will resume in area where it stopped. Final floor plan was pretty darn accurate (lot of negative reviews about the mapping being inaccurate), also found it relatively easy to create rooms. Have an iPhone 11, don’t know if type of phone was the issue for those who complained about difficulty with the feature. I do wish there was an option to create CUSTOM room labels. When creating rooms I found it’s best to zoom the floor plan when creating room lines, otherwise the named room may not correspond exactly to the actual room. This feature is a must because bot only completes 80% of house on ONE charge, then have to wait 3 hrs, so if u don’t want to wait that long to get a specific room done ....... The actual run time on ECO mode is approx 1hr40mins not 2 as previously stated, and the charge time is approx 3 hrs. The dust bin gets emptied at least once during that time. Many times bot seems to be lost- it will do 1/2 living room then go to bedroom then go back to missed area in living.. not a big deal as it gets it done. BOUNDARY STRIPS- don’t know yet if the NO GO ZONE feature in APP can replace the use of strips- for big areas maybe, but I have strips around pet water bowl and I don’t think I can make that a no go zone so I don’t have to have the strips. Will experiment with that feature as I’m not thrilled about having boundary strips in certain areas. My silly dog was initially scared of the strips and wouldn’t walk over them to get to her bed. Dog doesn’t love the bot she’s a scaredy-cat so she goes outside when in use... it only took the cat 2 runs of bot before she realized it’s harmless... hope to see her riding it some day :-) .... I am still impressed about the amount of stuff this thing is sucking up on ECO mode, and it is not overly noisy.I can only assume the other 2 modes are suction beasts but probably a lot noisier and drain battery faster.  Though not perfect, if one is willing to spend the time for set up and understanding it’s quirks, it is definitely worth the $$$ ...I’m very happy.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 1157, 'reviewer': {'name': 'ZELSKA'}}, {'title': 'It has its place.', 'body': \"I've had this for over a year and I've already had to have it replaced because the cliff sensor won't out.

(My prior robot vac literally just bopped around randomly with zero logical cleaning pattern.) It seems to do an okay job on our medium pile area rug, including “climbing” on and off it without getting stuck. Suction power is okay — it actually picks up less than I was expecting during a whole house run vs my old robot vac based on how much debris is in the compartment. My kitchen floor has visible debris on it after the robot vac has been through, so I know it is missing stuff despite the “smart” cleaning pattern. As a result, I am still needing to take my big upright vacuum out daily to do our kitchen and living room. It is extremely loud — not much quieter than an actual vacuum cleaner running. I can’t really run it when we are at home it is so loud. It is fairly high profile, so does not fit under some of our furniture. The biggest problem I have with it is it never seems to be able to dock itself. It bops around the dock until the battery dies without successfully docking, even after making adjustments to where I keep the dock. It supposedly has a great feature where it will return to the dock to charge mid cleaning if the battery is low, then once charged will return to cleaning. This feature doesn’t work though if the robot vac can’t actually reliably connect itself to the dock (and mine does not).  We bought this at a very steep discount during Black Friday sales. For the price we paid, it is fine (not great). It would definitely be going back had we paid higher/had higher expectations for a robot vac at the price point we paid.', 'rating': 3, 'helpfulVotes': None, 'reviewer': {'name': 'M'}}, {'title': 'Works well for its price point', 'body': 'The good: I really wanted to give this little guy 5 stars. Because we have a couple of very vulnerable people in our family I dismissed our former cleaning service when COVID came to town and never started them up again. I purchased this bot from Amazon on sale during the pre-Christmas sales. It replaced a cheaper robot, which failed miserably. This robot may not get every single bit of crumb and hair on its first go-around, but it works very well. The routes it creates are logical, making parallel sweeps that align to the walls. It neatly goes around the legs of furniture, returning accurately to the path it was on before it met the obstacle. It does a reasonably good job each time it is run. I found that by running it daily for a few weeks and then 2 or 3 times per week it kept my floors looking quite nice. (I have no pets or small children. If I did have either one I would probably maintain the daily use.)  The good: The bot has no problem getting up close to the irregular line of our natural stone basalt fireplace. It wiggles along the edge going in and out and cleans this area of dust and such very well. In fact, the bot does better than I did with the vacuum and better than the housekeepers did. It doesn\\'t care how long it takes. Obviously, people-based cleaning involves beings that do care how long this process takes. Same for other irregular surfaces. The bot goes in and out as long as it takes. For our finely crafted mid-century house, this is a really big deal.  The Good: The built in cliff-avoidance works very well. In 4 months the bot has not gone over an edge even once. In our mid-century house there are not only stairs, but also other drop-offs that look really nice but would probably not be allowed with current codes.  The good: This little bot is much quieter than expected. Naturally there is the noise created by the air going through it, but there is very little actual motor noise. Usually when it is working I am working at something else in a nearby room. It makes just enough noise that I can tell where it is, but not enough that it distracts me from what I am doing, and not enough noise to wake those sleeping in the next room.  The good: I did not bother with the app because I have oriental rugs with fringes that must be picked up prior to running the robot. I also choose to put the chairs up out of the way so the dining room floor gets really clean. In bedrooms I do a quick check to be sure there are no socks on the floor, etc. Scheduling therefore makes little sense. However, the bot works very nicely without the app. For those who want no app, this will work beautifully. I find that it was best to use the bot to clean half of our main floor, let it recharge, then clean the other half. This is something that the app would not support. If you have a larger house, or multiple levels, this is a really good thing. I actually have 3 very separate areas that are cleaned by the bot and the app would only be useful for one of them, as it only stores 1 map. The app-less cleaning is done quite logically and the entire floor in each room of each area is cleaned reasonably well. As noted below, small bits may be missed, but with regular use my floors are clean to look at. A fairly significant amount of dust and debris are picked up every time the bot is run.  The bad and the ugly: Corners are a real problem for the bot. Once in a while you need to get your finger into a wet paper towel to clean out the accumulating guck in the corners. However, the same is true when I vacuum with a conventional vacuum. It was also true when I had maid service clean the floors monthly (only then it was their fingers in the paper towel, rather than mine.) Also there is sometimes a bit of stuff left. For instance, after cookie making with small children, if the bot is put in the kitchen and the doors closed so it can clean up the flour on the floor, there may be a place or two where a bit of flour remains. Run the bot again and it will get that last bit, or just wipe it up. I see this as a minor issue, but a real one.  The really bad and ugly: Unfortunately, Shark has dozens of models that are very similar with different model numbers. Even more unfortunately, your model number reflects the place where you purchased the bot, not the bot itself. Your model number is virtually useless in trying to find the right replacement parts. Third party parts are often ill-fitting or poorly made and the shark site is of no help in locating your actual model from the model on the bottom of the machine. However, the online chat person or the call-back support are quite helpful and very fast.  More bad and ugly: The model number on the box of the one we purchased was different from the model number on the bot and also different from the model number on the enclosed documentation. The instructions in the manual did not match actual parts on the bot. Even the instructions on the bot did not match the configuration of the bot. For instance, there is a figure on the bot suggesting that a circular filter be cleaned regularly. Problem? Filter does not exist, and no place it could fit. If one were to attempt putting a filter into the area adjacent to the figure it would cover the window where you are supposed to be able to see the level of the dirt in the collector. (Not that big a deal, though, because the plastic \"window\" is so darkly tinted that nothing can be seen through it anyway.) Using the mis-matched manual requires a bit of flexibility. If, for instance, you know that you need to pinch something and pull, the fact that the tabs mentioned do not exist, you can find something else to grab and pull. This has worked fairly well, though not without a bit of annoyance on my part. It would be nice if there was a bit of labeling to indicate just where something should be grabbed to dis-assemble for cleaning or replacing filters. Putting the actual part number on the replaceable parts would also be a really great idea.  More bad and ugly: This is probably a petty gripe. However, for those of us who must use the bot without the app, a key part of this process is to turn the machine off while moving it, then on again to begin cleaning or to send the bot to its port. It would be a really nice convenience if the on/off switch were put on the top where it would be visible and easily reached rather than recessed on the side. Turning off the moving bot is a bit of a chore. If it were recessed on the top it would be quite easy to use a cane or broomstick to knock the rocker switch one way or the other. The instruction manual clearly states that one should not pick up the bot until after it is turned off, but turning it off first requires a bit of a circus act, following the bot, locating the switch and pushing it without triggering the thing to take off in another direction (the camera sees you and that alters the path).  Overall, I would recommend this product for a person who is willing to live with its flaws. I am happy with the cleanliness of my floors, it takes less than 4 minutes for me to ready the dining room for cleaning (12 chairs, 2 oriental carpets to move) and less than a minute to check other rooms for cords, dropped items, etc. Then it takes the bot about 30 to 45 minutes for each of the separate areas. During its cleaning time I almost never need to do anything related to the cleaning process. I do clean the dust bin every time I clean, a process that takes only seconds. About once a month I clean the dust trap on the bot itself. That process can take anywhere from 2 minutes to 5 minutes depending on what is there. If the bot picks up a straw or paper clip, more stuff gets stuck to that obstruction and the lint can pile up. At any rate, I spend considerably less time on this process than I would spend cleaning with a vacuum (which has its own quirks) and the bot is actually more thorough than I would be, spending about 2 to 3 times as long in actual cleaning than I would. Time spent cleaning is important. The bot moves slowly enough to give the suction time to be effective, also slowly enough that when it bumps into furniture legs it does no damage. Also, in 4 months it has paid for itself, compared to the amount the housekeeping service would have charged. Of course, it does not dust. Too bad. My house always looks presentable, I spend less than an hour in actual floor maintenance time but the floors always have that \"just cleaned\" look.', 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': 412, 'reviewer': {'name': 'ARO'}}, {'title': 'So far so good...', 'body': \"We live in a one level apartment. We have been using a neato 3d connected vacuum for the past 4 years or so. Neato closed up shop a while back and recently, the software on our phones that control it stopped working. From what I can tell online, it's the android version not allowing it to connect which would cause the app to require an update to start working. Well, with the company out of business and the lack of being able to control the thing... we had to try something new.  One thing the neato really had issue with was connectivity. It was fussy even when we first got it. It would take many tries to get it to connect and work with the app. Once it connected, it was good for quite a while, but eventually, we'd have to reconnect it by uninstalling the app, resetting the vacuum, etc.  However, what it did well was clean and was easy to clean/empty the bin. It was a D shaped vacuum with the broom/suction going edge to edge on the front of the D (left side of the D). The dirt receptacle came out of the top, so you'd let the device finish and park, then just pull the bin, dump it and drop it back in. You didn't have to pull the vacuum off it's stand, flip it over or mess with anything. It also picked up a lot of dirt (we have 2 cats and 80% carpet covering our floors). Also, with magnet strips on the floor barricading the rooms/areas we didn't want it go, it went only where we wanted it.  So, we had 4 years of that experience to compare any new device to.  This new vacuum cleans well and seems pretty thorough. Connecting it to the app was fairly painless and we have only had to do that once when we got it (2 months ago).  It is a bit more effort to empty the bin as you have to pull the vacuum out of it's dock, remove the bin, be careful how you open the bin as it likes to pop open quickly which dumps dirt everywhere, then bang it on the trash can to get the filter as clean as you can, close it, re-install it, then push the vacuum back onto the dock.  Since it's not the D shape like our old one, it doesn't get close to the walls like it used to. I mean, it tries with the little spinner brush thing, but it doesn't do as good of a job.  It doesn't follow the map very well when you block off areas for it to not go. Sometimes it does what you tell it, others, it goes where it wants.  Also, the filter is glued to the receptacle. So, when it's time to change the filter, you throw the whole bin away, which seems like a waste, but it is what it is. They aren't overly expensive, $25 for 4 with new spinner brushes. Just seems like a waste to throw the entire thing away when it likely wouldn't have taken much effort to make the filter itself removable.  If this one dies on us, I'm not sure what we will try next. Dyson makes a D shaped one as does roomba, but if this lasts 4 years like our last, who knows what will be available then. Maybe shark will make one too!\", 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': None, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Bryan Loehr'}}]}, 'reviewsTotal': 1769}, 'product26': {'reviewsPaginated': {'reviews': [{'title': 'Amazing Product at an Affordable Price', 'body': \"I went into Prime Day this year knowing I wanted a robot vacuum + mop.

It does a fantastic job and is so affordable.  I have hardwood floors and a few area rugs that the robot has no issues maneuvering. The vacuum suction is powerful and the mopping function is great to use in-between deep cleanings. Best of all- it's so quiet! It won't disrupt you at all (unless it gets stuck, but that's bound to happen with any robot vacuum once in a while!).  I have two cats that shed a lot and tend to track litter through the house, so it was important to me to find a robot vacuum that works well for pet hair and litter. This little guy takes care of those problems with ease! The cats aren't a big fan yet, but never say never 🤣  It's also important to mention that the app for this robot only works with 2.4 GHz WiFi! I was afraid I might have to do some extra leg work to get the app to connect since I have both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz WiFi. But actually, another reason I chose this robot was because it comes with a remote (and batteries!) that I could use to control it- just in case the app didn't connect to my WiFi and/or gave me any problems. However, it connected right away with no issues! The app is very user-friendly and easy to navigate, too.  Great product. If you're on the fence, don't be!

In my case I have two carpets, and I can restrict these areas for the mopping feature as I don’t want it to mop the carpets.

Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo with LIDAR Navigation - 5000Pa Suction: A Game-Changer  After using various robot vacuums over the years, this 5000Pa Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo has truly impressed us with its performance and design.  Maneuverability: The LIDAR navigation on this model makes a world of difference. Unlike our older robot vacuum, which often bumped into furniture or struggled to map rooms, this one glides smoothly through our home. It intelligently scans the area and creates a precise map, effortlessly navigating around obstacles and tight corners. The ability to clean under furniture and around legs is remarkable—rarely getting stuck, even in tricky spots.  Dust Collection: We were amazed at how quickly it filled the dust collector during its first test on our main floor. The combination of powerful suction and effective navigation meant it picked up a surprising amount of dirt, dust, and pet hair that we didn’t even realize had accumulated. After just one cleaning session, the dustbin was full—proof that the 5000Pa suction really does the heavy lifting.  Mop Functionality: The mop feature works surprisingly well for a combo unit. It manages to leave the floors looking clean and polished after a session. While it's not a deep scrub, it certainly handles everyday spills and grime effectively. One thing to note is that the instructions advise against using any detergents in the water tank. Even so, plain water alone has proven to do a solid job, which makes maintenance and cleaning hassle-free.  Ease of Use and Programming: The app interface is straightforward and user-friendly. Setting up the vacuum for the first time was quick, and programming cleaning schedules or customizing cleaning zones is a breeze. We especially appreciate being able to monitor its progress in real-time and tweak the cleaning plan if needed. You can even choose specific rooms or areas for it to focus on, making it highly adaptable to your cleaning needs.  Suction Power Compared to Older Models: One of the most noticeable improvements over our previous big-name brand robot vacuum is the suction power. The 5000Pa suction power on this model far exceeds what we’ve experienced before. This robot, however, delivers a much deeper clean across our hardwood floors without getting confused or hung up..  Final Thoughts: Overall, this Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo has exceeded our expectations, especially compared to older models.

The first two were bought in 2021 and 2022 and are still working fine despite daily use. We have mostly hardwood floors and they are quiet and have good enough suction to keep our house clean with 2 dogs and 3 cats. We occationally need to break out the manual vacuum to get in the hard to reach spots but I have severe allergies and these work wonders with little effort on our part.  These do have a hard time getting over taller transition pieces and tend to get stuck under our office chairs and other tight areas but overall at this price point you get plenty of bang for your buck.  The newest K2 looks slightly different than our older versions, and it's clear they've made upgrades to their app since our first purchase. Something to note, the app requires 2.4 GHz WiFi, NOT 5.0. You will not get it to work if you're using your main home wifi which is almost certainly 5HHz. Most products like this use 2.4 GHz because it has a larger range at a slower internet speeds vs a smaller range at faster speeds at 5GHz, meaning the app functions better across larger homes/larger ranges. If you aren't able to use the app properly you need to set up a guest WiFi with 2.4 GHz. It took me about 10 minutes to download the app and get all three of our vacuums set up. It was a breeze, but only because I learned this recently for a different product and knew how to prevent issues going in.  The app itself is easy to use, you can name your vacuums and set different schedules. It tells you the charge on each vacuum and when they last ran. It also has a find feature if your vacuum gets lost. You can set different suction powers on the app and cleaning modes as well.  We have a vacuum on each story of our house and they have never gone down the stairs. That's been an issue with more expensive brands but never any of these guys, they seem have great sensors, even when dirty.  Considering this is our third of this brand I'd say we're pretty happy with this product. It's cheap enough that if you're looking to get into the robot vacuum lifestyle it's not going to hurt your wallet. We've tried several more expensive brands that have died quickly but these things seem indistructable.

Fortunately OKP has a 1 year warranty and Amazon told me to contact them for a repair or replacement. Great, right?  Apparently not, because OKP decided to not respond to my help request at all. Amazon followed up with me to see if they had fixed the issue and I told them they hadn\\'t. So Amazon has offered me a partial refund. So I send the broken robot back to Amazon, they give me a partial refund, and I am left with nothing and am out $40. OKP doesn\\'t back their warranty, and you can\\'t get a full refund or replacement from Amazon after 90 days. There are many other reputable robot companies, but this is not one of them.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update: After using this for a few months now, I kind of hate this little robot. I\\'ll be honest, the company advertises that if you leave a 5 star review they\\'ll send you a free gift (which is actually illegal to do according to the FTC, and against Amazon policy). But I did leave a 5 star review and sent it to OKP, but never received a gift from them. I suspect most of the 5 stars are because of this bribe they\\'re offering. Take them with a grain of salt, as I now know I should have done.  Compared to my other robot vacuums, this one is the least effective. It\\'s smaller, much lighter (the plastic housing feels thinner/cheaper), but also less powerful. It drives slower than my other robots and only lasts about 30 minutes, whereas my other robots will run for a couple of hours.  It has different power settings and I keep it on the lowest power setting. If it\\'s on high then it won\\'t last 30 minutes. I find this robot is best suited to cleaning one small room, but it definitely can\\'t handle an entire floor or even one large room. I\\'m using this one now in my small bedroom (10x11) and that\\'s about all it can handle on one charge.  I originally loved that it didn\\'t have a brush roll, and that\\'s why I bought it. Then I realized that I could just take out the brush rolls on my other robots and I\\'d end up with a more powerful version of this little guy that just works better.  The biggest problem is that if it stays on the charging dock for too long, then it stops charging but the battery slowly drains. I was trying to use it once a week, and every time I tried to start it, it was completely dead (while still on the charger). To get it to work I have to take it off the charger, place it back on to get it to start charging again and then wait a couple of hours to start running it. If I don\\'t run the robot the same day it goes on the charger, it doesn\\'t retain enough battery to run. It\\'s not really a hands off system since I have to plan out when I\\'m going to reset the charging and then time it out to come back to start the robot before it starts draining power again. It\\'s incredibly frustrating. Do yourself a favor and buy a more expensive model that will just work whenever you need it to.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Original review: Just got this robot and so far I\\'m pleased with it.

The machine is sturdy, and even came out unscathed after a half-story fall.  But it is dumb. Really dumb. It uses mostly random patterns with some logic on what direction to focus on, and does a decent job of trying to get unstuck. It will even shut off the vacuum suction if it becomes stuck or there\\'s a clog. I believe it uses IR to find its way back to base, but it uses the random logic to find that signal once the useful battery life for suction has ended. The app also only notifies me rarely when it gets stuck. And the setup isn\\'t intuitive either as it relies upon a mashup of 3rd party unknown home automation apps.  It gets stuck under my bed frame a lot, where it has decorative drops in the wood. It also gets tangled a lot on any type of loose clothing or cords and has even ripped up some long strands in my older looped carpet.  The \"works with Google\" is a complete flop and I disabled it. It has been turning on at random times more and more lately, which is very annoying. I think the \"run\" IR signal is similar to something in my house, maybe the thermostat.

No matter when you last vacuumed, there will be more hair. I never expect it to do the job of a vacuum. It’s a sweeper. All carpets and nooks and crannies still need a real vacuum when it’s finished sweeping. That’s okay. We call it Marvin.  The good: I bought Marvin for under 100 expecting it would be cheaply made and not as effective as the Shark I used to have. I was wrong. Marvin is my best friend. I am so impressed with it! It makes vacuuming a once per day job instead of an ongoing struggle. I am constantly surprised how much hair Marvin gets and how great my hard floors look. It came with replacements for each sweeping arm and the filter. Emptying it is simple, and cleaning the arms is as easy as pulling them off, removing whatever is caught, and snapping them back on. It has an optional app if you want to program the times it should run and a remote if you’d rather tell it to start without needing the app. Marvin has battery life is enough to thoroughly make its way through my living room, dining room, kitchen and hallway before needing to go home and recharge, which is perfect for us in our apartment where the rest of the rooms are carpeted and need a real vacuum. We love Marvin.  The bad: Marvin is… stupid. We joke that it is time to play the lottery when Marvin actually finds its charging base and no one has intervened. Marvin also has no advanced AI learning like the expensive floor robots do. You will not be able to tell it *not* to go somewhere so if you have an area with cords it might eat, or an area it can get stuck… yeah, it’s going to unless you make a barricade it can’t get through. The app is only to program the times it turns on and the pattern of sweeping it does, not to program its path. When it does get stuck, it is obnoxiously loud trying to free itself before it gives up and sadly beeps for assistance. You’ll know it needs help before it does.  For as inexpensive as it is, I’d recommend it to anyone who would like a sweeper bot but, like me, the 300-700 bots are way out of their price range.

I sent an email about the problem I described below and within 24 hrs I heard back from them. They asked for some basic ordering and product information, which I provided. Today I got an email saying hey are replacing the unit at no cost to me due to the unexpected cliff sensor failure. I'm a happy camper, again. I'd recommend this vac and this company. I'm impressed with their prompt response to my needs and I'm looking forward to having Sidney back in action.  UPDATE- Well, it turns out Sidney had a death wish. He took a leap from my main floor to the lower level under the railing on the staircase. The 'cliff sensors' apparently did not work. I had worried about him going down the stairs so I put something in front but there are two pieces of railing on opposite sides of the spiral stair case and he got under and flew down to the floor. It cracked the bumper piece and while the unit still runs, it now keeps trying to climb the walls and furniture and gets stuck every few minutes, so it's essentially useless unless I can get it fixed or replaced. It hadn't happened the first few times I used it so I thought it was safe to not block that opening. I sent an email to the manufacturer (No answer when I tried calling) but haven't heard back. I'm not sure if this is a defect or just bad luck. I still like the concept of this type vacuum so I'll get another one with barrier strips from another company - I'm not wanting to spend the 500 to 600 dollars to get one with a virtual wall but I am willing to spend a little more because I now know I like not having to vacuum and dust myself and that they essentially do a good job. I'll be blocking the stairwell and railings with the next one. I still think this would be a great vac for someone wanting an entry level vac but who doesn't have stairs or drop-offs on the floor plan.  I've never had a robot vac before but have been looking at them for awhile. I didn't want to spend $300 plus on something I may not like (I have a vacuum grave yard in my house for all the vacuums I've purchased but don't love (including Dyson). Anyway - this little guy was on sale on Prime Day for about $110.00 and I thought it would be worth it to purchase it as an entry level vac to see if I liked the results. I'm pleased to report that I was surprised, delighted and horrified by the amount of hair and dust it picked up on it's first run. I had just dusted the day before but was anxious to see how it worked and let me tell you this little guy (I call him Sidney) was worth every penny. My house is very open and I have a spiral staircase from the main floor to the basement. I was worried about him falling down the stairs but he just kind of tried to go on the stairs then backed off. I put a air cleaner in front, though, just to be sure after the first attempt. I have floor registers and he got hung up on one but then maneuvered over the others just fine. He did wander into my spare room, which is carpeted. I didn't think he'd be able to work in there , the carpet is a deeper pile than the area rug in the living room - but her made a few passes but then stalled on the register in there, which is an older metal one that sits up high He made all the transitions from room to room if there was a lip at the door. I basically only used him on the wood floors but I do have an area rug in the living room and he navigated that just fine. In fact he fit under the couch and cleaned up there. I can't tell you the last time I pulled it out because its awkward and I don't have help.  Yesterday, I put him in the bedroom upstairs, picked up everything on the floor and set him loose and closed the door for about 90 minutes and he picked up so much dust and hair from the bedroom and bathroom floor, it was amazing.  . I'm pleased as punch, my floors never looked cleaner. When I do it manually there are little bits of dirt left behind but Sidney didn't leave a one.

For $99, this felt like a good deal. Overall, the vacuum does work great with pickup up hair, dust, and other bits. Each time it runs, the canister shows how good of a job it's done, even if it runs over the same area on a daily basis. Add to that the fact that it can run on a schedule and I don't have to think about it, I would give this 5 stars. However, the reasons for my 4 star review are the following: 1) the instructions are helpful but not thorough. You have the option to schedule this to run at a certain time, but I cannot figure out how/if there is a way to only set it for certain days. It either runs every day at the specified time (which seems unnecessary), or not at all. With the schedule, I had set it to run and some days it did, and some days it didn't, but then when I reset the schedule, it started to run every day. So, it worked, but really by accident because I had no idea how to set it. 2) this thing gets stuck EVERYWHERE all the time. Every time it runs, it gets stuck on something. Under a cabinet, in a corner, at the edge/top of the stairs. Part of this could be that the height of my lower cabinets is just tall enough for it to wedge itself under and not get out, but it is quite annoying to always have it get stuck. As I write this review, the vacuum is beeping at me again from a precarious position at the top of the stairs. Apparently, it can't really tell that the stairs are there and it should back up? Those are my two biggest issues with the thing, but again, for $99, it still feels like an acceptable price for what I get. It does have great suction, so when it's not stuck on something, it does an adequate job of cleaning. It is pretty loud, but it's a vacuum. The Edge functionality doesn't seem to work that well, but I don't use it often so it doesn't matter. For anyone that purchases, be mindful of cords or other lower profile things that are sitting on floors. We've had it pull lamps and other things off tables because it gets snagged on a cord, or knock over things that I'd think it would avoid (like mini Christmas trees or plant stands).

I run the vacuum until it dies in the bed room. It is a little loud so I wait till everyone is up and ready for the day so it can work without people being in the bedroom. My carpet is low/medium pile so it does a good job of getting all the top hair, dirt, etc from the carpet. However it will leave huge fuzzies from dog toys. But it will move them out from under the bed so I can pick it up easier. I would suggest if you have carpet that you do a deep suction vacuuming atleast once a month to get the deeper dirt, but overall it works awesome. I even noticed it smells cleaner and my dust headache went away. I actually sleep better and wake up more refreshed. It also leaves a pattern in the carpet so if you leave it unattended you can see exactly where it went, and it had gone everywhere. Even under the bed, dresser, and nightstand.

At night I run the vacuum around our open floor plan living and kitchen area. We don\\'t have a table but an island that the vacuum can easily go under. I clean the island, put the chairs & garbage can on top, pick up the dogs dishes & toys, blankets, and pillows. I run the vacuum in that area space until it dies, since I go to bed I\\'m not sure how long it runs but it always finds the charging port and is ready for the morning run fully charged. I noticed that if you turn off the lights under the couch it can get stuck since it\\'s so dark so I put a small night light back there so it can \"see\". It goes under my ottoman as well. Since it\\'s low pile carpet and hard flooring there is no pattern to check and see if it got anything but I have not noticed any areas where it has not gone. Definitely make sure you can pick up all that you can so it has more access. After each clean I empty the dust bin to see how much it collected. It only takes a minute and I like seeing each rooms progress. I\\'m always surprised on the amount it picks up since I run it every day. If you have bigger spaces or more rooms I would suggest making a schedule to do rooms every other day. Or get one for each floor, as they are cheaper than sharks, roombas etc. and is good quality. If you have built in carpet all over I would try the deep suction vacuum. I have a mix of tile, vinyl ( I think), and carpet. So the mop was not worth it. THIS VACUUM GOT DOG FOOD STAINS OUT OF MY LOW PILE CARPET. This vacuum could be your only vacuum if you have hard flooring and low pile carpet.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 43, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Mdepoe'}}, {'title': 'Not terrible for the price, probably best for smaller spaces.', 'body': 'I work in an understaffed animal shelter so we really dont have as much time as I\\'d like to sweep and mop all the concrete floors in our building. So I figured I\\'d give a cheaper robot vacuum a shot to see how viable it would be in our building. Its not a massive building but it does have lots of long hallways that I figured would be pretty easy for this little bot to handle since it wouldnt have a lot of obstacles to avoid.  I\\'ve been messing with this robot for about 4 days and here are my honest thoughts on it. Feature by Feature.  The Smart Cleaning mode This is the only mode that creates a live floor map as it cleans, mostly relying on bumping into walls to figure out the floorplan. As opposed to some other robots that use LiDAR scanners to map out rooms and save the data for future use. This guy does not do that unfortunately, which I knew purchasing but like I said wanted to try a cheaper option first. The map it generates as its bumping into walls can often be skewed like in my included picture. I can assure you the hallways in my building are all 90 degree straight angles. Whereas in the picture the hallways are curved and tilted in odd ways. Which led to it having inaccurate information once it tried to go back to unfinished areas creating a hard wall in the middle of an already mapped hallway which led to it getting stuck going back and fourth along the top wall as you can see in the picture because it thought it was going into a corner with no way through. It did not do it quite as bad the second time I ran it so im not sure if it was just a fluke. but its clear it does have a hard time accurately mapping long hallways straight. when closed off in a mostly square room it did perfectly fine mapping the room. It also does not save these maps for future use so it already knows the layout, instead creating a new map every time it is ran in smart clean mode.  Edge Mode This was the most effective mode for my use case. The shelter obviously has a lot of dog hair which collects where the walls meet the floor. This robot managed to do the entire building only getting stuck once on a section of carpet but I also had the mop attachment still on which I think created too much friction with the carpet causing it to just kinda do circles on the carpet.  Spot Clean Kinda useless if it was doing it right. I set it in the middle of a large room and told it to spot clean. Which it demonstrates as just doing a spiral outward. Now I expected it to just keep spiraling outward until it hit a wall or something but it just did like a 5 foot diameter circle and stopped. I did this multiple times thinking something just messed up and interrupted it but I think that\\'s just all it does..  The App. The App isnt the greatest. Its simple and gets the job done but it lacks any real details about all the various settings and modes. There is no description on the differences between \"Smart Clean\" and \"Auto Mode\" or what the \"Carpet feature\" does. The paper manual included has slightly more information about these but its still pretty vague.  The Vacuum Probably the best thing I can say about this vacuum is it does vacuum very well. with the dual corner brushes on the front it grabs all the hair and little bits feeding it right into the roller brush underneath. and it has great suction really packing that small dust bin tight.  The Mop Not great. Kinda regret getting this version with the mop attachment. It kinda just drags any dirt and grime behind in a wet little snail trail drying into visible streaks. It also doesnt soak the mop pad very well mostly just getting the left and right side of the pad leaving a mostly dry middle and this is with the water use set to \"strong\" You can remove the mop attachment and just use it as a vacuum but the dust bin and water tank are one piece so you have to empty the water tank which often leads to water getting into the dust bin which you dont want so I ended up having to wipe water out of that and let it fully dry before being able to run it again. I cant really see a good use case for this type of \"mop\" because its just not going to clean well dragging a wet dirty rag behind it. The instructions also tell you not to use any disinfectant additive to avoid corrosion so its pretty pointless for disinfecting floors.  Summary Ive only got experience with a couple of these robot vacuums and I think in the right space you could get your moneys worth here. I mean it is a pretty cheap price for a 2 in 1 robot vacuum with app control so you get what you pay for as with most things. I would say the killer here is just how useless the mop is which would be fine if the water tank didnt take away so much space from the dust bin. I have ordered the WYZE Robot Vacuum which is 50 more dollars than the 150 I paid for this one and seems to have a much more robust navigation system with LiDAR and many more smart features in the app. So hopefully that one is more useful for my specific use case.', 'rating': 3, 'helpfulVotes': 2, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Casey Rosa'}}, {'title': 'UPDATED 2+ YEAR REVIEW - from 4 stars to 5 stars...', 'body': \"***08/07/2020 UPDATE***  I don't write a lot of reviews, but I had to come back and update this review from 4 stars to 5 stars. Is the vacuum perfect? No. But is it one of the best purchases I've ever made? Yes. For the money, this thing is a life changer. We haven't had to vacuum or sweep (except in corners and hard to reach places) since we bought it more than 2 years ago. For the most part it has run without issue. I change the dust bin every night (and knock the dust out of the filter), and clean and remove the pivot wheel and brushes occasionally as they can pick up some hair and fuzz. It has started acting a little strange where it won't run automatically after it's been powered off (I only power off if we go on vacation and can't empty the dust bin). But if I just adjust the schedule by an hour and then back to original time it seems to correct itself and run the next night per schedule. Anyway, there are fancier models with more features, but for hard surfaces and the price, I would buy this again in a heartbeat. I sometimes wish it would die so I could get one with a bigger dustbin - but now that I'm used to emptying it every night it's just part of my nightly routine. If you're looking for your first inexpensive robot vacuum - I can't recommend this one highly enough.  ***09/05/2018 UPDATE***  I've now had the V3s Pro for 6 months and had to come back and upgrade my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars. This vacuum has proven to be so effective it has really improved our cleanliness around the house and I am constantly recommending this vacuum to friends and family. It is very noticeable when it hasn't run for a couple of days as the dog hair shows up on my dark floors. The vacuum still has a few issues - the dust bin is so small that it fills beyond capacity every night. We have a pile rug that sheds like crazy along with 2 dogs so there is no shortage of material for the vacuum to suck, but its a pain to have to empty the dust bin every night. My next robot vacuum will have a larger dust bin. Additionally you need to do a good job picking up the floor every night before it runs (also forces good habits). Shoes with long laces, dog toys, clothing, sloped lamp base, dog bowl - all will find a way to tangle or disrupt the vacuum. Also, I've gotten over the gripe I mentioned about the scheduling and charging. Yes, it's a dumb glitch or programming decision, but in reality it doesn't really matter since I just run the vacuum every night anyway.  ***ORIGINAL REVIEW***  Only had the vacuum for 2 days but so far it seems to function well as a vacuum. However, there is an odd programming bug (or feature choice) on the remote that won’t let you cancel the schedule time. The included instructions state that the only way to keep the robot from running at a scheduled time is to turn it off with the power switch. Problem is, the instructions also state that the vacuum will only charge when the power switch is in the on position. Alternate instructions found online suggest that you can set the schedule time to 00:00 but this functionality is not available on the remote I received. Instead it just rolls from 12 to 1. Perhaps this was a safety feature to keep people from leaving it on the charger in a chargeable state for days or weeks without a discharge? Or it’s just an annoying bug in the remote programming. Either way, it’s an annoying situation. I now have to remember switch the robot off after it docks to make sure it doesn’t start by itself at the scheduled time, but if I switch it off when it docks it won’t charge. For the time being, I don’t trust it to just run unsupervised and prefer to start it when I’m available to keep an eye on it. Tried to reset the schedule to 00:00 and discovered that you can’t. It may be that if you never set the start time in the first place you won’t have this problem so keep that in mind as you set it up.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 65, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Reviewinator'}}, {'title': 'Sure wish I would have returned it when I had a chance.', 'body': \"I do not like this vacuum. I had a Dreame before, and I didn't like that but this is worse. I did have two iLife “dumb” (no mapping) robots previously and they were great for what they were. In fact, one is still doing rough duty in the garage and one is at my friend's cabin. So I felt good about going with the iLife brand again. Alas:  Cons: - The app is terrible. It's unintuitive and is lacking some features. - The map has completely reset itself – twice - requiring me to re-map and re-set all the rooms. - Does not follow set schedule correctly often. Sometimes does not clean certain rooms. Sometimes does not clean at all even though vaccuum is in dock, charged, and no errors. - Gets stuck on anything and everything - rugs, socks, dog toys, furniture. - Alexa does not work with the app. I tried for hours. - When complete, it goes back to dock, but then may times repeats “looking for the docking station” while continuously pulling out and trying again. Moving the docking station and cleaning sensors does not help. It's a random issue but about 1/3 of the time. - Terrible at my dog's hair (lab). It leaves it in clumps which at least are easy to pick up. - Very very noisy, especially on anything but the lowest setting. Lots of gear noise. - Very small dust bin. - If it gets stuck or paused and then you restart the vacuum, it will proceed to clean the entire house, not just the rooms originally on that schedule. = If you select the wrong thing to do, and then cancel, it doesn't actually cancel. You have to turn the vacuum off and return it to the base station to actually cancel. - The voice is really weird. Sounds like it's running low on batteries. Evil sounding at times. - It's repositioned itself on the base station a couple times very late at night after it's been docked for hours. - Just a design thing. My next one will have two brushes in front. One is just so ineffective - too many pieces get missed as one brush will throw them a few feet, were two brushes would trap it. - Mop is pretty useless. Just a gimmick really.  Pros: It is powerful. I think the dog hair issue is from the bin opening being too small so it just gets stuck around the brush. The base station so far is great – no jams, very powerful, and bags are easy to change.\", 'rating': 1, 'helpfulVotes': None, 'reviewer': {'name': 'J. C. Evans'}}, {'title': 'One of the Best Buys Ever', 'body': 'Purchased the iLife v3s pro at end of November, 2021 on Black Friday sale. So it has had daily use for 2 months.  I had soured on robot vacuums after going through 2 expensive iRobot vacs 7-8 years ago that got pet hair hopelessly entangled in its main brush gears and constant hangups under chairs. The iLife caught my attention first because of the low price and the high customer ratings. My interest piqued when I read that it had no central brush, just two counter-rotating side brushes. Simple design. One thing that did work well on the iRobots was their single side brushes, which had few issues. The iLife having 2 seemed like a good idea. I have a super shedder Golden. Reviews confirmed that this did great on pet hair. So I sprung for this vacuum, and so glad I did.  I programmed the schedule for it to run automatically every morning before I get up to clean a large great room, kitchen with a table rug with short tassels and runner along the island, attached mud/laundry, an entry with a thick rug, and a long hallway. The v3s bin is full every day, mostly with hair, but also a lot of small crumbs and fine dust. It’s pretty impressive what it picks up, actually. It climbs up the entry rug, which is almost and inch thick, with no problem. It has never tumbled down the staircase near the entry. Sometimes the side brushes catch a corner of the kitchen rugs, but the vac does a maneuver where it rotates 90 degrees and goes to one side or the other and disentangles from the raised rug. I never have to intervene. It does well on the carpet in the great room. All of the rugs are very low pile, and the carpet is medium pile. I don’t know how it would handle shag rugs or carpet. It does dishevel the kitchen table rug tassels a bit. You do have to tie up electrical chords a few inches off the floor, and it did get hung up a few times on the Christmas tree skirt.  If you let it run, it cleans for about 1.5 hours and returns to the charger. The return is hit and miss. But I found about an hour is long enough, so after that time I pick up the unit, take it over to the hallway down which the charger is located, aim it at the charger and push the start button to start it on its way. After a few seconds I press the Home button on the remote and it reliably finds its way back and starts charging. All of that takes about 15 seconds.  Daily 5 minute or less maintenance involves wiping dust from the front and back screens with a wet paper towel or kleenex, and emptying the dust bin. When I dump the dust bin, I take out the main filter and tap it clean against the inside of the garbage can. I tap the open dust bin gently against the garbage can to dislodge dust from the fine filter. Every few days I take the fine filter out and tap it against the inside of the garbage can to dislodge even more fine dust. I haven’t replaced the fine dust filter yet, but I did buy a box of 10 from iLife on Amazon, which I think will be about a 2 year or more supply. After about 6 weeks I noticed some fuzz coming from underneath the bases of the side brushes. They were easy to unscrew and both had dog hair and lint wound around the stem of the brushes that was easy to pull out. No hair down in the gears. This took about 5 minutes and will probably be needed on a fairly regular basis.  Does it clean perfectly? No, but almost. Along the kitchen runner where it has one wheel up on the rug and one wheel on the wood floor, it misses a few crumbs that I have to pick up with a broom or my Dyson. Occasionally there is a crumb that I wet a finger and pick up by hand. Now and then the corners need to be cleaned by hand. But overall it has almost eliminated the need to vacuum regularly.

Randle'}}, {'title': \"'Dumb' Robot, But Works Well Enough\", 'body': \"We're running two of these on the ground level of our house. One was purchased about a year ago, and works well enough at this price point that we ordered a second one.  NOT having a wifi in these robots was a plus for us. Cell phones, TVs, and now newer cars already spy on us. I will not have vaccum cleaners, dish washers, refrigerators, etc., in my home spying on us too. Our thermostat does not have wifi capabilities. Damn corporations can keep their advertisements out of our house and away from our daughter. Government can suck it too. Yes, I'm one of those IT weirdos that runs a PiHole on my home network, blocks everything, etc. You should to.  These iLife robots seem to be pretty 'dump'. Only comparison is that years ago we had a refurbished iRobot vacuum that we got at half-price (because it was a refurb) (these iLife robots we purchased new, not refurb, wanted to be clear). That iRobot last about four years. Batteries and these robot vacuums are better now, so these run longer per charge than that old iRobot. But...that early model iRobot would maintain a map of the house and could easily find its way back to the charger when it needed to. These things seem to bumble around the house in a completely random fashion cleaning, and when their batteries get low, they wonder around aimlessly looking for the charger. Most of the time they find their way, but not always. I work from home, and sometimes when I go upstairs for lunch, I'll find one cruising around lost looking for home. I'll use the remote to 'guide' it to the charger.  These things seem to run for about 90 minutes on a charge. The first one is about a year older than the second one, and both seem to run for almost the exact same length of time. Hopefully that means the batteries are of a descent quality and will last a long time. The old iRobot I replaced the battery packs twice in four years. In the end that old faithful machine just got glitchy and we had to scrap it. Fingers crossed these iLife machines last longer due to advancements in technology. We'll see.  Until I add an outlet to the laundry room, the two charging stations are sitting side-by-side in the guest bedroom. They must use reflectors to line themselves up with the charging stations while parking. Having the two chargers side-by-side confuses these things as they are trying to park. On occasion, when one is coming in to dock, if the other is already on a charging station, the incoming robot will go crash-up derby on the first one. On those occasions that I'm 'steering' a robot back to charge with the remote, I'll block its view of the other station with my feet so it will go to the one that I want it to. Seems to be a design flaw, but really likely a money saving decision. Keep in mind if you have multiples of these and place the charging stations next to one another, you can expect some problems. If you are easy going, then you'll be ok. If such things annoy you, try to place the chargers in separate rooms.  If anything interrupts their job, say one gets stuck or tries to eat a sock, if you carry the stranded thing back to the charging station, you'll want to press the timer and the clock buttons on the remote again. Seems if they do not complete their task for any reason, they'll lose their programing for the next day. This is easy to do, using the remote to kind of 'reset' the programed start time and clock, but it was nowhere in the instructions. We figured it out through trial and error.  I find the instructions to not be clear for clock time and programing a scheduled start time. Basically, you're looking at the remote to set the time and schedule a 'go' time, but the robots have to beep at you so you know they received the programing. You use the remote to see what you are doing, but if you are not within range of the robot while you are doing it, or pointing the remote away from the robots, they do not receive the instructions. Program your remote with clock time and start time. Then, point the remote in the general direction of the robots, and press the clock button twice (like you are going to set the time). The robot will beep with each button push as an audible confirmation that it received the message. Then do the same thing with the schedule button. Ours run at 9am so they can finish by the time I go upstairs for lunch. This way, I can rescue one if they get stuck or lost.  Most of the time these guys cannot get over the transition strip between our bedroom floors and the bathroom tile floors; its a 'speed bump' that they usually cannot climb. On occasion they'll hit it just right and get into the bathroom (and then choke on trying to eat the bath rug). Know that they struggle with what I believe is something they should be able to get over.  Replacement brushes are available. They don't cost the world, but I wish they were cheaper. The first robot needed a second set of new brushes at roughly the one-year mark. Note that they do come with an extra set of brushes, and we do appreciate that. Thanks iLife. Do NOT lose the little screw that secures the brushes. I'm a shade tree mechanic, and know to keep track of little fasteners, but I failed and lost one. Couldn't find a replacement anywhere. Tiny, close to 3mm in size, but an odd thread. We emailed iLife and asked about purchasing some, but they sent us two for free. Again, thanks iLife.  Some amount of hair and dirt will find its way between the brushes and the body. Keep this area clean, and be sure to clean it out thoroughly when replacing brushes.  We use the upright vacuum to clean the filter, and as a result they last well over a year easily.  Since we have two of these that are about a year apart, I've noticed a difference in the software. The older one is easier to 'steer' with the remote; say I'm guiding it to the other end of the house at the start of its shift for example. The newer one will 'fight' me for control by immediately turning right after following my command to turn left. Very frustrating. As a software developer myself, I cannot understand why they would program it to do this. Me being stubborn and trying to 'best' a dump machine (I know, not a 'smart' move on my part), I keep telling it to turn left until after half-dozen times or so it finally stops fighting me. Almost as if it has to travel X distance before the programing just takes my input. I hope they fix this in later models.  Not the 'smartest' robot, but at this price point, we went back to the well and purchased a second one. When we go for a third machine for the basement, I might try a different make or model. I miss the very old iRobot from years ago keeping track of where it had been and keeping a map of the house layout so that it would cover all of the floor, and so it could easily find its way back to the charger when low. These things are much cheaper now days, but seemingly way, way dumber than those that came before them. As long as you understand what you are getting, and can deal with the quirks, I can recommend this product. If you don't want to deal with lost robots wondering the house in search of a charger, or perhaps something that will simply and blindly follow your every command (with the remote), suggest you look for something else.\", 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': None, 'reviewer': {'name': 'feltennova'}}, {'title': 'My Robot Friend', 'body': 'I have had my robot friend, Simon, for a week. First impressions upon opening the box was an “Oooo Aahhh”. The directions said to let your new robot friend charge overnight before first use, but of course, I ran him around immediately to just see how he works! He worked for about ten minutes. I couldn’t figure out how to get him to his home (charging station), but it turns out, he can find his own way home just fine. I recommend that you do take a few minutes to read the directions and familiarize yourself with the remote. It took about 4 hours or so for Simon to fully charge, then I turned him loose. Let me just say, I thought my floors were clean, or, at least, pretty clean. As it turns out, they were not. They were not clean at all. Simon has picked up so much fur, dirt, dust, it’s unbelievable. My floors have literally never looked better! They are CLEAN. For real clean. I’ve always had a hard time cleaning under the bed, but now I don’t have to worry about it at all, because my robot friend takes care of it.  I have all hardwood floors and tile. I also have a few throw rugs, some thick, some thin. Simon does a perfect job on the floors, and has no problems navigating over the throw rugs (though he might turn up a corner, but he will run back over it and still get it clean). I don’t think your robot friend would work very well if you have a lot of or mostly carpet. If you have hardwood or mostly hardwood, you will love your new robot friend.  Simon mostly gets from room to room okay – the “up” entry points he cannot do on his own. For example, he cannot get over the hump into my kitchen, but he can get down the hump. He also cannot get over the hump to get in the bathrooms. This is actually fine for me, because I prefer to control when he goes into the kitchen anyway so that I can shake off the rugs and/or pick up the cat food and water bowls and any shoes or other things that might be on the floor. I just put a bar stool in his way to keep him from exiting the kitchen when it’s time for him to clean in the kitchen.  Simon will clean for about 3 or 3.5 hours. He does not have a “plan” so to speak, not like a person would say go from corner to the center of the room, but he is still very thorough, and obviously, his plan is way better than mine since my floors are so much cleaner than they ever were when I was in charge. My advice is to just trust the process and let your robot friend find his way around on his own! Just make sure that you pick up any cords, especially small cords like phone charging cords, and shoe laces or the like, so that he doesn’t accidentally grab onto something he shouldn’t. Simon also has sensors so that when he comes to a piece of furniture or a wall, he will slow down so as to gently bump it before he turns off into a new direction. I have also noticed that if he comes into contact with a chair or table leg, he will often go in a circle all the way around the leg to clean around it.  Once your robot friend is done doing your dirty work for you, he will go back home on his own. If your robot friend cannot find his way home, you may not have provided him enough space. Is that any way to treat your new best friend?? Make sure that he has several feet of clear space in front of his charging station, and that there are a few feet of clear space on the sides of the charging station as well. Also, make sure to empty out his dust bin after every use.  One of the fortunate side effects of having my new robot friend, is the “give a mouse a cookie” effect it seems to have had. Give a person a clean floor, and the person may say oh, it looks so clean in here, let me pick up this shirt and put it away. The person then notices that the bathroom trash can is full; since the floors look so nice, the bathroom should be clean, too *cleans bathroom*, and so on.  The only thing about my new robot friend, which isn’t enough to bother me at all, is that he is, well, he’s not super loud, but he’s not very quiet either. So, if you are watching tv, you may need to turn it up just a bit if you are running your robot friend while you’re at home. Well worth it for the service he provides, though.

I will start off by saying you really do get what you pay for…I first bought a little cheapie knock off $100 one to see if I even liked them because I wasn’t about to spend a ton of money on a piece of junk….to our amazement we couldn’t believe how much dirt and dust this little sucker was gathering up. We do have four cats though they’re not long haired, they still shed. While this little clean machine did well it got stuck a lot!!!! We were constantly pulling it out from under chairs, beds and couches…goes back to we didn’t pay for ‘not get stuck’. Lol.  We bit the bullet and bought a Roomba. It far exceeded the capabilities of the previous robot by leaps and bounds. It actually is ‘Smart’…sometimes scary smart. It knows the names of objects, rooms in the house and areas without being told. It never gets stuck!!! I run it everyday on a schedule for certain rooms…certain days etc etc. So all I have to do is go behind it and mop….saves me soooo much time. Win win.  Fast forward to today when I decided I’m sick of mopping and I’m starting to wonder if I should buy a mopping robot. I decided that I did not want to fork out a big chunk of change on another Roomba that has a mopping mode as well since I already have a Roomba that vacuums. I thought that it doesn’t even have to be smart just do a good job and I can handle the rest soooo I bought this sucker. It was originally $200 but it had a $50 coupon so $150 was totally affordable for me and worth it considering I know what these little dudes are capable of…..super fast shipping….got it the next day….very easy instructions to load the app on your phone. It only comes with one mopping pad which is ridiculous so be prepared to buy refills….not that big of a deal but annoying. You can only use water in it….no detergent whatsoever or it can ruin the machine. I think if you need to you can add a very small amount to the water but it can’t be anything that has a foam type consistency….kinda weird that a mopping tool doesn’t use soap but I went with it…it performed exactly as I thought it would considering I didn’t pay a lot of money for it. It doesn’t really ‘map’ like a Roomba does so basically I have to trap it in each room that I use it in which was a huge pain in the butt at first but now that I have every room down and know exactly where it gets stuck I avoid all the hassle now. You have to keep an eye on it unless you have your room set up and know the obstacles because it will get stuck on top of things….under things…everywhere. It’s definitely not ‘smart’. You can’t just turn it on and expect it to clean one room and then go to the next….it might clean a little area in that room and then go to another room and clean a spot and on to another and the same thing….it never cleans an entire area on its own…that’s why I have to trap it in the room I want cleaned.

I did all the trouble shooting things, NOPE... denied!! still didn\\'t work. Then it started just randomly saying things, like \"headed home\" when it was setting on its charger, or \"charging\" when it had been charging all day... just weird. At any rate, at this point it just stopped functioning all together. I contacted Customer Service with a very precise message of what I had done to correct any issues and what the machine was doing, CS promptly returned a message telling me to do all the things I had already done, also asking for a video. OK... I sent them another message with the video and explaining again that I had done all the things. I receive a message telling me it looked like a battery issue, they responded with a message needing an invoice and a model number. I sent them the info, they scolded me and told me that the model number was not the serial number which was the info the needed. I sent them a photo of the serial number, model number and all the numbers. They responded quickly saying I should have my battery within 5-7 business days.

I've had this Eufy for about 6 months and I'm sold. If it were to break tomorrow, I'd buy another one in the same day. I LOVE THIS VACUUM!  I owned a Roomba in the past and when the battery died permanently, I was looking for another one. I was in the market for about a year because I wanted one of the top models but didn't have the budget. I was convinced that Roomba was the best but I was so so wrong. What started my quest into other models was the purchase of a new couch and it sits low to the floor so I knew a Roomba wouldn't fit under it. I needed a thinner robovac. This one is 2.85 inches tall and my couch is 3 inches above the floor. I knew it would be a tight fit but I took a chance anyway. I read review after review on about 5-6 vacs. I really wanted to know how they compared to a Roomba. I'm glad I chose this one.  Here's my comparison. A few things that need to be mentioned is that I always run my Eufy on Max and my Roomba was a lower end model (E80).  Eufy vs Roomba - Eufy can dock itself from the far side of the house (1800 sqft). My Roomba couldn't find its dock when it was right in front of it. - Eufy suction power (on max) is easily equal to that of my traditional vacuum. Roomba was ok. Eufy has pretty much taken away my need to use my large vacuum (I didn't know this was possible) but my Roomba was more so for uses between vacuuming. -Eufy's suction power is strong and it is a determined little machine. Eufy can literally pick up coins off the floor and it will push things out of its way. Eufy even leaves vacuum lines in the carpet. Roomba never did any of that... ever. - Eufy gets ALL of the dog hair off my floors. Roomba made the pet hair manageable. - Eufy comes with an app and a remote. My Roomba did not. The app is easy to use and even has a feature to make the device play music so that you can find it. If you've never owned a robovac, trust me that will definitely come in handy. - Eufy has a larger catchment container and its easy to empty and clean. - Eufy replacement parts are cheaper. - Both machines are about the same on battery life and noise level.  The only con about the Eufy is the amount of time it takes to charge. It will run on Max about 45 minutes to an hour but it takes 3-5 hours to fully charge. This doesn't really bother me though because I just run it in the morning when I wake up and again in the evening around dinnertime.  Maintenance Maintenance is easy. I empty the container after each use. I clean the brushes and filter after every other use. I only run my Eufy with a full battery and I only use it while I'm in the house to watch it. Its strong suction will cause it to get tangled in cords, shoe laces, curtains, elastic hair ties, etc and I have to free it. I never let Eufy die. It will flash orange when the battery is low.  TLDR: Eufy is better than Roomba in every way. It's amazing, totally worth the money, and I would buy it again. Buy this robovac.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 27, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Briana Mitchell'}}, {'title': 'Exceeded my expectations', 'body': 'The media could not be loaded. There\\'s literally dozens of different types of robot vacuums out there; and there\\'s like 6 different models just for Eufy/Anker alone. What the right one? Behavioral software routines, or actual home-mapping... which autonomous technology is better? Do I spend the extra money for a self-emptying machine?  Yeah, I ran through all these questions too. I finally settled on the Eufy 15C-MAX as being the best balance of cost vs. features for me. I\\'ll tell you that I was not not disappointed in the least!  Being WiFi-connected, you might think it would difficult to set up? Actually it very simple. Download their free app and follow the instructions. Just make sure not to connect it to you 5GHZ wifi. It absolutely will not connect to anything other than a 2.4GHz Wifi signal - but that\\'s Okay, most routers broadcast dual channel... just make sure to tell Eufy the correct name and password for the 2.4GHz channel. Within minutes our Eufy Vac was renamed to \"WALL-E\" and we were programming it\\'s schedule.  We set the charge base up in our guest room, against a wall that has a clear view through the doorway and down the hall. Why? Because the charge base has two invisible infra-red beams it shoots out. Like a TV remote, you can\\'t see them, but your vacuum can. And when it wanders into their path that how the vacuum finds the charge base to return home. The easier the charge base can bee seen from several points in your house, the quicker the machine can find the charger!  I\\'m utterly impressed with how quiet this thing is. We have a 12-year-old, 130 lb, Rhodesian Ridgeback who has become disturbed by many noises. To my surprise, and satisfaction, he is not very disturbed by the vacuum. Actually he\\'s rather curious about its movement... but he pretty much leaves it alone. (You can see the video. Note how you can hear his nails clicking on the laminate floor... and compare that to the sound of the vacuum running. - This thing is very quiet!)  Quiet, but very powerful. Clearly, if you watched the video, we have a dog. He may have short hair...but he sheds a lot of it. The Eufy vac has zero problem grabbing hair from both our area rugs and our bare floors. Its slim size glides under most of our furniture with ease.  As for agility... I\\'m again extremely impressed. The bot doesn\\'t just go banging into things and bouncing off. It actually uses proximity sensors. Not in the video, my better half has the lightweight soldier Christmas decorations on the floor. The machine doesn\\'t push them or even knock them over. Instead it senses them and glides around them.  The battery life is staggering, and it is exactly as advertised. Brand new and after a full charge we get about 100 or more minutes of total vacuuming time, before it goes into \"home\" mode and shuts down the vacuum... quietly looking for the base. When it finds the base, it slowly and quietly backs in. Perfectly, every time - so far.  If you are undecided on whether to go with a vacuum that uses the MIT-based Behavioral software scripts, or the actual home mapping system... I was too. Home mapping seems like it would be so much better. And it may be, but I definitely do not regret my choice. The behavioral scripts in the Eufy do a great job. Sure, it does repeat some spots, but eventually it hits all spots and does a great job doing it. For the price... it exceeded my expectation.

Now it drives in circles and beeps. Off to the garbage it went. I ordered the newer version of it. Good news is I buy open box from Amazon and I only paid about $170 for it. I think that's not bad for 2 years.  What I like about this vacuum is it has good suction and is quiet. It fits under the furniture pretty well. It picks up a lot of stuff on hardwood floors. I don't think it does much good on carpet. We have wool throw rugs with fringes and the roller brush wants to tear those up and my wife threatens me with a terrible death if I don't protect these rugs. It finds his way back to the dock about 70% of the time, which from my reading about other vacuums is not a bad percentage. On the one that broke I never could get the phone app to work with it. The remote however works just fine. The dustbin and filters are easy to empty and change and there's plenty of aftermarket brushes and rollers and filters that work just fine and are cheaper than the brand name. I find that the brushes wear out in a few weeks and filters can be washed and dried, maybe once, but I don't think they're supposed to be. Anyway, they're not very expensive and they do a good job.

It's not a fancy expensive model, which I appreciated. I watched it randomly cruise around my house the first time I used it, and it made me crazy! There is absolutely no pattern to it that I can discern, and I couldn't see how it could possibly do a thorough job. But the floors looked much better when it was done, and the bin was full of fur and dirt. My floors are wood, with low-pile area rugs in a couple of rooms. The next time I ran it I ran the upright vac over the living room rug right after the robot was done, and there was almost nothing in it. Since then, I run it every other day - when I'm not home! It makes less noise than the dishwasher, which is very quiet. It gets under the bed, and under the dresser, and under the sofa, and under the china cabinet - all places the upright can't go. I've figured out where it gets stuck, and I move the furniture to prevent that. I usually put the dining table chairs up restaurant-style so it can get under the table easily. It climbs a wider shallower threshold, but a threshold finished with quarter-inch round stops it. It doesn't get into corners, of course. The little sweeper arms pop off as soon as it hits a rug, so I just leave them off. I've tried the spiral setting to clean up a spill of dry coffee grounds, and it worked great. I haven't bothered downloading the app because the remote works just fine for me, I just hit the button on my way out the door.

Dirty Harry has never given me an issue. He is easy to clean, works very well and on hard floors, low carpet, and he has replaced my regular vacuum.

The dust cup and bristles are very easy to clean and I clean the brushes about once a month. It came with several replacement parts like a filter and other bristles, but I have yet to need them.  Harry runs a couple times a week and has done so faithfully for a year. I've had relationships that didn't last this long. He's NOT silent, but you don't really hear too much noise when he's working.  My only complaint is that I wish the collection bucket was bigger, and that's only because I'm lazy. I can..and have..run it all week without emptying it, however..once it's full, it leaves a line of dust as it rolls around. Not a big deal. The only other thing that could slightly qualify as a complaint is needing to put up all of your cords. The bristles pull cords in with ease.. then the vacuum sits and beeps because it's stuck. It took me a few days for it to find all the spots where it could eat cords that I had not already found. Is that really a complaint..? Nah..  This vacuum goes easily under low furniture, rides your baseboards like a show pony, and cleans short carpet with ease. I absolutely love it.

I was excited to try this vacuum because I live in a house with all hardwood flooring and a few area rugs. These floors are NEVER just clean. They constantly, and I mean constantly, need to be swept, vacuumed, and/or mopped. I can vacuum a room, finish and just start again...literally. So I wanted a vacuum that would wander around and try to keep up with the constant mess and dust and such that our family creates. Enter Stanley. I like the brand Anker and these seem to be a favorite on this site. I did order a more basic model because I figured it would be a good jumping-off point to see if this was a good concept for our home at all.  Pros - there\\'s consistently a good amount of dust if not much else in the bin when he\\'s finished. Stanley is easy to clean from recepticle to filter to rolls/brushes. Everything comes apart really easily. He is supposed to notice when he\\'s nearing something like a wall or furniture, and for the most part he does his job of pausing and turning before plowing into that object. He\\'s quieter than a normal vacuum. Stanley\\'s profile is low enough to even get under items like my treadmill. And his climbing power is pretty good to get over things like the edge of the thick mat my treadmill sits on. He even climbs up onto my rug when the corner is curled up. Stanley is gentle enough that when he bumps into my toddler\\'s toes he doesn\\'t hurt her.  Cons - He\\'s definitely noticeable when he is on, I wouldn\\'t exactly call him quiet. His brushes struggle to not just knock things around my floor like a pinball machine. Crumbs will take a tour of my entire floor before they get sucked up...if that happens at all. The suction could be better, but maybe I\\'m just pitting Stanley up against my Shark in an unfair way. I do notice that when Stanley is on a rug the suction does increase automatically. He doesn\\'t always notice when he\\'s about to bump into something and I swear it\\'s gotten worse over the week. He doesn\\'t map the home or go in any sensible pattern. (I didn\\'t realize how valuable this feature could be.) So there are times where he prefers one area of my living room or will criss-cross around the hallway but never fully covers the entire area. The remote is nice, and when my kids are asleep I will use the remote to try to get as much of an area covered as possible. The roller brush on the bottom is easy to remove and clean, but the hair wraps tightly around the two ends and is more difficult to cut off. There\\'s no way to set areas that are off-limits, and because Stanley just kind of twirls and whirls around the house aimlessly, even if you remove him from a room and push start again he\\'ll often just turn right around like a defiant toddler and run right back in. Sometimes he doesn\\'t understand doors and just won\\'t exit a room at all. So I have to pick him up and manually move him from room to room because he just seems to not sense the open doorway and just keeps vacuuming the same space over and over and over again. I have yet to have him run out of a charge or even get low. But honestly, after babysitting him to clean a room I just kind of dock him before he\\'s ever fully vacuumed the house.  Overall - we like him because he\\'s like a little robotic pet.

We've had it for 45 days. I'm frustrated. In the other room right now, it sounds like a 16 year old, grinding the gearbox their first time out in a standard.  Generally, it's a good vacuum. It picks up debris reasonably well, though probably better on hard floors than on carpet. We have four long haired people in the house, plus a short haired dog and two cats that shed like it's their job.  The roller is not the full width of the vacuum, which means that it relies on the sweeper brushes to pull debris to the center so that the roller can pick it up. The result on carpet is that if the debris that needs vacuuming is near a wall and it's something like a lint ball that would rather stick to carpet than be swept, the robot will leave it behind. You'll still have to vacuum the corners and some of the edges periodically, but for day to day maintenance, it does well. That appears to be typical for most robotic vacuums, though, so that doesn't make it worse than any other vac.  The noise level is fine, though hardly silent. It's loud enough that you'll want to shut it off or send it to another room if you're watching a movie. On carpet, in another room, it's impossible to hear.  It is hungry for socks and dental floss if you have kids that drop either or both like we do. But that's our problem, not the kids. Worth mentioning here because if you have kids, you need to choose your battles and this will be one of them.  The roller and brushes are brilliantly easy to clean. The roller even has a clever little notch that makes it simple to get the provided cleaning tool (pretty much a letter opener) fully under the spool of hair that will collect at the ends. We have 4 long haired people in our house and I'm grateful for this nice touch.  For coverage and navigation, it seems to get the job done, if inefficiently, which is fine. It appears to have proximity sensors, and it's almost comical how it avoids some walls and edges so conservatively that it does not clean them, and others it runs into at full speed. It seems to randomly toggle through different navigation modes (edge, then random back and forth) and, if left alone, covers the floor nicely.  Although it runs into furniture regularly, it hasn't marked anything. It has left a wheel track on the edge of the carpet. That comes out with a regular upright, but I hope it isn't a problem long term.  It's just barely not quite short enough for getting under the base of our table and some cabinets. It gets stuck and has to ask for help. Reminds me of a particularly dumb turtle. It also means that under the table and under the edge of the cabinets don't get clean. It would be nice if it had a raised hard edge rail that would prevent it from going under low spots, rather than wedging itself in place.  The app is minimally useful, but it is useful and worth the very small extra cost. because you can't hear it in the next room sometimes, the app will tell you when it gets stuck. Also, the alarm beep when it does get stuck doesn't last quite long enough, and you'll need the find-my-vac feature to locate it under your bed or dresser, which is where it will inevitably find a sock to eat and get stuck.  The sock eating happens often enough that a spit-it-out feature might be nice. Also, if it eats a sock, an under-the-dresser sensor might be nice, along with the smarts to navigate itself out from under the dresser.  The scheduler is nice, but we don't let it run when we're not home. It's bound to get stuck and need help. This doesn't negate the benefit of having a robot vacuum. You just have to keep an ear out for it, stop your laundry folding or pause what you're watching on TV, help it out, and go back to what you're doing.  Of course, if it breaks in less than two months, what's the point? I can hire somebody to vacuum for a month and a half for less, and they'll clean the corners.  Update: I contacted Eufy and they sent a replacement unit, no questions asked. Their response was prompt and they paid return postage.\", 'rating': 1, 'helpfulVotes': 20, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Zeeboogiefish'}}, {'title': 'The best model to get for under $300', 'body': \"I have spent weeks researching robotic vacuums. After comparing and contrasting different models from big-name brands like iRobot, iLife, Eufy, etc, I figured this would be a good budget vacuum. I bought this a few weeks ago and have been using it. Here are my thoughts. Build/Physique: This is a very sturdy unit. It has the classic round shape other robotic vacuums have. It weighs a few pounds but isn't too heavy. It's big enough where it can suck up a good amount of dirt, but not so big where it can't get underneath things like tables, but chairs can be a bit of a different story. Setup: Setup is easy. I just followed the instructions and put everything together as described/shown. Controls: What’s nice about this vacuum is that you can control it with a physical remote (that comes with it) or the Eufy app on your smartphone. The app has slightly more functionality than the remote, but it’s trivial depending on your needs (see below). I don't personally need the app, but I can see why it would be convenient. Some folks may want to run the vacuum while they're away from their house. Maintenance: Remember, the only robotic part about the vacuum is its ability to scour your house and suck up dirt and muck. It is not a self-maintaining machine. That being said, emptying the dustbin is simple -- you just press a button, release the bin, unfold it, and dump it out. The filter is also easy to pop in and out. If I'm not mistaken, there are one or two filters that are washable, along with some disposable ones. Cleaning the roller brush and the side brushes is also very easy, and there are extra side brushes that come with the unit. If you need more, you can order individual parts or a kit that (I believe) 8 side brushes, one or two roller brushes, and some filters (sorry, I don't know the quantities). Performance: This is where the fun begins. If you're not familiar with how robotic vacuums operate, here's a quick breakdown -- models like this one and many of the lower-end machines just blindly roam around and pick up whatever they find. More expensive units have navigational systems that allow them to map your house and create a floor plan so it knows where it is, where it's been, and where it hasn't been. Both WILL vacuum well, but the higher-end vacuums perform more efficiently. This vacuum roams around blindly, and it can be very frustrating to watch it move sporadically around your house. I also own an iRobot Roomba 980 which does have the mapping capabilities, so it covers the same amount of space in far less time. All this being said, however, it does have great suction and picks up things very well, including dog hair. I have a medium-sized yellow lab that sheds profusely, and it manages to suck up the hair very well off of hardwood floors. It also manages low-pile carpets well, too. Don't get this vacuum (or any robotic vacuum for that matter) if you're planning on vacuuming deep carpets, especially if you're trying to get dog hair out. Make sure that you pick up loose wires or any obstructions on the floor. These vacuums need as little interference from objects as much as possible. If you do forget to pick up a wire off of the floor, the vacuum has a feature where if it accidentally sucks it up, it will recognize it is a wire and drop it after a few seconds and move on. My Roomba 980 doesn't do that (to my knowledge). In general, it does well with not getting itself stuck. I have a pretty large divider that separates my kitchen floor from my dining room floor (about 3/4 of an inch), and it manages to get over the hump easily. Another nifty feature the vacuum has is cliff detection, so if it approaches stairs, it will not fall down them and get damaged; however, there's a drawback to this. If the vacuum encounters carpeting that is dark, the it might think it's seeing black and not continue to clean that area, so it'll move away. Stray away from dark-colored carpets if you can. It may bump into things from time to time, but there won't be any scratches on the unit. It has a bumper on it that will receive the impact of any collisions it has with objects it finds. There are three suction power settings, escalating in power from 1 to 3. You can adjust with the remote and I would assume the app. It even beeps the number correlating to the suction power when you press the button, so 1 beep for suction power 1 (or the lowest setting), 2 beeps for suction power 2 (or the medium setting), etc. If something goes wrong, it will beep in patterns, and you can check what error message is being denoted. I also like this feature, and the beeps are pretty loud, too. The unit is fairly quiet. You can clearly hear when it's on, but it makes a fraction of the noise a regular vacuum makes. This would be good for people who work from home but want to run the vacuum. Other vacuums (including Eufy's 30C) has a feature known as boundary strips or virtual walls. These are devices, or magnetic strips in Eufy's case, that send out a signal that prevent the vacuum from crossing a certain point/line. If you didn't want the vacuum to enter a certain area of your living room, you'd just have to put down one of the strips/set one of the walls at that area to prevent it from entering that area. The 15C Max does NOT have this feature, which I personally enjoy and would prefer to have, but, like having a regular vacuum, you're going to have be tidier if you want the vacuum to run without any problems/hiccups. You can also schedule the vacuum to run at certain times, which can only be done through the app. This feature is meant for folks I mentioned earlier that want to run the vacuum while they're not home. The app also shows you the current state of the vacuum: whether it's in standby mode (which just means it's docked and turned on), cleaning, and offline. Battery Life: At a full charge, I managed to get about an hour and a half (90 minutes) worth of a cleaning cycle out of it at the highest suction power. Eufy claims you can get up to 100 minutes at a full charge, so I'd say this checks out. The extremely convenient feature of this vacuum is that it is self-docking, which means if you press the power/home button on the remote or app (or if the unit's battery is low), it will stop cleaning and return to the charging base all on its own. It does behave strangely if the base isn't in a clear location/up against a strong-walled surface. So, make sure you don't have anything blocking the path for the vacuum to get to the base, and ensure that the base is firmly against a wall. This is easily one of my favorite things about this unit. The Bottom line: For $280, this vacuum rocks. You won't find a more powerful machine. It has some great features like painless setup, automatic self-docking charging, auditory suction power and error codes, cliff detection, compact size, a great battery life, powerful suction, flexible control devices (remote/app), easy maintenance, scheduling/automation, and cheap replacement components for order. There are certainly some drawbacks like darker carpets interfering with cliff detection, randomized roaming that doesn't make sense, and no boundary strips, but again, consider an iRobot Roomba 980 whose price is currently $900 as of 07/21/2019. It does have mapping and virtual boundaries, but you need to consider the significant price hike comparing these two particular models. Is it worth three times what this unit costs to pay for a machine that does have those features? This is in no way an insult to iRobot, but not everybody can just drop nearly a grand on most things, especially a vacuum. Take it from me who has a machine capable of efficient navigation. I'm glad I got both and was able to test them out. Watching the 15C Max after using the Roomba 980 is painful. But again, three times the price. The Eufy is still very powerful and picks up dirt/hair great. The Eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 15C Max performs very well and has plenty of awesome features with just a few drawbacks, and I truly believe you won't find a better robotic vacuum for under $300.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 1738, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Luke'}}, {'title': 'Great little robotic vacuum, and an essential tool for a multi-pet family', 'body': \"I've resisted getting a robo-vac since they first came out. They've always been too expensive in my mind for what they offered, and I was never able to see the value in having one when vacuuming the house once a week always seemed to be plenty.  Well, that was before this past few years, when we got two cats and a dog. The amount of fur being shed was making area rugs bought in the last few months dingy and faded even with regular weekly vacuuming. And weekly is the best we manage. So I decided I was going to take the plunge and finally buy this model of robo-vac since the price was often very reasonable with the frequently-offered coupons.  I've had it for two weeks now, and I'm a skeptic no more! The day it arrived, I fully charged the battery and ran it in just our living room, where we have a medium-pile 8 x 10 area rug. The bin was packed at the end of the run, and it took four more days of cleaning just that room on a full charge before the bin finally got to just 1/2 or 2/3 full. I would recharge the battery and run it separately in the rest of our ground floor, where it's all hardwood and much smaller / thinner area rugs, and that was better after just 2 runs.  I now have the vacuum scheduled to run at 1 AM every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. I just pick up the stuff on the floor and move things like dining chairs or trash cans to maximize the floor coverage. This is just the right schedule, as it's keeping up with our pets shedding and the bin is moderately to mostly full. And on the weekends, I run it in our finished basement and the second-floor rooms where the pets spend much less time.  Still have to use our canister vacuum for the smaller spaces where this robo-vac can't get, along with vacuuming the pet hair off the upholstery. But our once-a-week vacuuming time is now faster and more focused, instead of being the half-day chore it always was in the past.  What I love most about this robo-vac is that it fits under all of our couches, dressers, and other furniture with a raised bottom, so those spaces that never got cleaned without pulling out the furniture (which was never for the big/heavy pieces) now actually get cleaned with the rest of the room. I was amazed when Puck (that's what we've named it :D) rolled right under my wife's dresser, clearing the space by what looked like a couple of millimeters. It wandered around under there for maybe 30 seconds and finally found its way back out with equal ease.  It does get stuck sometimes on some of the furniture that has scalloped trim in the corners; mainly our living room couch. And I was really surprised when it got stuck under the side of our recliner in that room, so now I have to make sure that's positioned in a way where that won't happen during the nightly scheduled runs. And we have two doorways with thresholds that are just a smidge too high for it to climb up / down without getting a little stuck, but that's it as far as problems.  If you're like me and need to run it frequently, you *must* make sure to empty the bin and clean the roller brush after every single run, and the side spinner brushes as stuff builds up where they snap onto the vacuum. The brush roller definitely tends to get a lot of hair wrapped around it, and that makes it run louder if not cleaned regularly. The included cleaning tool is great for this, as it includes a small razor-bladed section for quickly slicing through the hair buildup.  Hopefully, Puck will last a good long time as long as I keep cleaning it regularly. I definitely prefer this kind of low-profile model to the more-typical thick-built ones that can't get under as much furniture. But if it ends up have reliability issues because of our more-frequent use, then I'll have to look into something like a Roomba model that's more user-serviceable.  Nov 5, 2022 UPDATE: Puck is still running like a champ. I still get close to 90 minutes of run time on a charge, even when I have to stop and start him every 15-20 minutes to empty the bin when we clean a room that got skipped for a couple of weeks. Have only needed to do standard replacement of the filter, side brushes, roller brush, and brush guard as those parts wear out (generally every 2-3 months for the filter, 4-6 months for the other parts).  The bin has definitely proved to be this vacuum’s biggest shortcoming, as it can fill to bursting after20 minutes with all the pet fur it picks up. This is true even in rooms we clean regularly, just because so much fur is shed by our three pets. When Puck does eventually wear out, we will be replacing it with a robovac that has a bin sensor and automatic emptying base. It’s still less work than regular vacuuming, but more “hand holding” that I want from a device that is otherwise so incredibly useful and that has made this chore much more thorough and bearable.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 17, 'reviewer': {'name': 'J.

My old one did not have this feature and if ran while I wasn't home and the bin got full it wasn't able to finish the whole job. Now this is not a problem. Plus after awhile I just got lazy or forgot to empty the bin so it wouldn't run on its schedule. Now not an issue.  This new device is way quieter! It's still noisy but compared to the older model 100% better.  I've only done the mop setting once and I wanst particularly impressed with it. I've only done it once due to having a large rug in my living room and the robot just wants to get up on it and I don't have the barriers purchased to keep it off. But I have epoxy concrete floors and I just didn't care for the mop job it did. It says for a wetter mop to wet the pad first but I was just giving it a try out and decided to not wet it first and the wet spots left on the floor were not solid, just like some little lines of wetness.  Overall it gets my floors vacuumed for me when I have other things to do so I would say it works well. I have about 1500sf of space it has to get just in the main living and kitchen area. It does need to charge before finishing all of it. It does seem to go over some areas multiple times for no reason and it gets stuck under my coffee table every single time it runs. So I'm not sure if the smart part about it works on this one lol.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 3, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Amazon Customer'}}, {'title': 'iRobot knows what they are doing', 'body': \"This is my third robot vacuum cleaner. My first was a generic Chinese brand, the second was a Shark with the self emptying feature which was a bonus. But this vacuum mop combo is amazing. It's primarily a vacuum. You can swap bins when you want to mop. Of course, with any robot, you must train it. Once trained properly, you can let it do it's thing autonomously. This is the not the highest end model but it does everything I need it to do. I was especially impressed by the mopping which I was a bit skeptical of at first. When purchasing, you should get all of the additional replacement parts such as the brushes, filters and bags as well. I found that I've always had to replace all of those for all of the brands I've used. I have multiple pets (casts and dots) which, of course, bring their own mess such as pet hair and food crumbs(Milk Bones to be exact). So having a robot vacuum and mop through out the week helps keep the place nice and tidy. Maybe I'll get the Brava which just mops later at some point. I highly recommend this product.

The self-emptying base is a standout feature, allowing the vacuum to manage dirt and debris without frequent manual emptying. The combination of vacuuming and mopping in one device is particularly useful for maintaining both floors' cleanliness and a polished look.  The Smart Mapping technology is another highlight, enabling the Roomba to clean specific rooms as needed and optimize its cleaning path for thorough coverage. The vacuum’s performance on various floor types is commendable, picking up dirt and debris efficiently.  However, there are a few minor issues. The mop function could use some improvement, as it sometimes leaves streaks or struggles with tougher stains. Additionally, the mapping feature occasionally needs recalibration to ensure accurate room layouts.  Overall, the iRobot Roomba Combo i5+ is a powerful and convenient cleaning solution with just a few areas for refinement. Its self-emptying capability and smart technology make it a valuable addition to any home, offering substantial cleaning power with minimal effort.\", 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': None, 'reviewer': {'name': 'John'}}, {'title': 'It was GREAT…at first', 'body': 'I upgraded from an off brand vacuum that cost less than $100 with coupons. At first, we were thrilled. It picked up better than the other vacuum and what’s not to love about the bin automatically emptying the vacuum? Now we’ve owned this thing for about 7 months and I believe it to be a waste of a few hundred bucks. It has stopped auto emptying. I’ve done all the trouble shooting I can find online. So now we have to hit to button to get it to empty, but only when the button is available on the app, which isn’t all the time. There’s a whole other fix for each time that happens, if you feel like spending 10-15 minutes doing it, which in my opinion I’d rather spend vacuuming my own floors. Sometimes it will randomly work and empty itself as well. We also constantly get errors that the roomba is stuck and when we go looking for it, we find it in the middle of the floor, not obstructed by anything, just stopped. It seems to error when finding home and just die quite a bit too. Overall, after seeing how great it did for only a short period of time, I would not spend the money on this brand name again. I’ve tried to submit a ticket for this on the app a couple of times only to have it error before submitting after I spend time typing all of this up. What a waste of $300. Save your money. This isn’t any better than the many other brands that are out there, but it definitely costs more. In fact, I talked a friend into buying a roomba during the first few blissful months when we loved it. I followed up with her recently and it turns out they returned it in less than a week because they too were getting constant errors, so this doesn’t appear to be unique. The whole idea is that it takes care of a chore so you don’t have to. But be prepared because you have a new chore now. Vacuum mechanic and locator.  I have been in touch with customer care. They sent me a new clean base and the problem was solved, or so it seemed. Then the vacuum began getting itself lost and not returning home and giving location errors again. I reached back out to customer service and they opted to replace the actual vacuum. While I was waiting for that vacuum, the clean base stopped emptying again, which was the problem I originally complained of. I figured I’d wait to complain until I could see if the new vacuum fixed it. Well, the new vacuum came with its own set of errors. Now it’s telling me the clean base is clogged (it’s brand new and I have checked it for a clog and there is none). It also gave me an error that the bag was full but it’s a brand new bag and not full. I’m over this vacuum. The only good thing about it is that they’re trying to solve my problem however a new problem continues to pop up each time. And since the clean base is new and a separate vacuum was also sent to me brand new, this appears to just be a bad product.im frustrated because at this point, I’d like to mail the vacuum back for a refund but am told that I only had 30 days to do that so basically I’m stuck.  Update. In 4 months we will have had this $400 piece of junk for 2 years, so it’s been just over a year and a half. The bin has NEVER emptied consistently and often doesn’t even alert us that it needs to be emptied so we think it’s working fine until we can’t get it to work one day and find the bin jam packed. We still consistently get random errors. We are unable to use “vacuum everywhere” because when we do, it just hops off the base, vacuums for 5 minutes and claims to have completed the job successfully. Now, it has stopped operating completely. We open the app and it says it needs to be rebooted but then the reboot doesn’t help. As soon as it comes back online it claims to need to be rebooted again. It won’t run. It won’t do anything. Absolute waste of money.

But I got one for Christmas and liked it so much I bought 2 more. I have all hard flooring, no carpets, and 2 dogs, a cat, and two birds that all contribute to mess. So I had to sweep everyday or I'd get those pet-hair tubleweeds blowing around. Having to sweep all the time I get lazy and let it go; or when I do it I spend an hour or 2 sweeping or vacuuming. These robots save me hours of time and get the job done better because they are relentless. I set them on a schedule and they do it everyday completely. I have one robot that I manually have to empty the cup everyday. He's in the bedroom, since I'm in that room every day that's convenient enough and only takes 2 minutes. I bought an i3+ and an i4+, they self empty and I have to change the bag about once every 2-4 months. I don't mind the cost of the vacuum bags because they give me so many hours of my time back.  The first one I got is the little guy. The little guy's name is Finigan. Finigan isn't too smart. He vacuums in a random pattern. I started with him in the main part of the house. He did a great job but his battery usually ran out before he considered himself done. So the space is a bit more then he likes. He did a great job though. But I loved it so much I got more to cover the whole house and moved him to the smaller bedroom area. In the bedroom suite (bedroom + bathroom~350sq ft), he spends about 45 minutes zipping around to cover everything. When his battery is low he docks himself. I have to empty his cup everyday. At first his cup was usually about 3/4 full to full. The first day it filled and he stopped. I had to empty it and re-start him. After a few months of daily vacuuming, the cup is about 1/4 full each day. So I switched him to a MWF schedule. He's still about 1/4 to 1/2 full each use. He even goes under the bed and keeps that clean. It's really great.  The i3+ is Dixie. Dixie does the downstairs. Dixie is smart. She goes in straight line patterns and covers the entire space using a very planned straight line methodical routine. The first day she poked around learning. It was about 1.5 hours. After that, the entire job was planned out and she did the whole thing in about 45 minutes. She has no problem when certain doors are opened vs closed. When it's open, she goes in and vacuums. If it's closed, she skips it. Her cleaning time varies from about 45 minutes to 1hr 15minutes depending on whether the extra rooms are included (doors open vs closed). She drives back to her base when done and docks. And the base sucks out what she collected. I love the base, it means I do not have to tend to her everyday. I actually only need to change the bag about every 3-4 months. There's not a lot going on downstairs. The litter box is there and so the cat pays visits. But we aren't down there daily tracking things around. Thanks to Dixie, there's no fur balls, hair-tumbleweeds, dust, or dirt. Always a nice clean floor. It's awesome. Her map in the app shows where she found 'extra' dirt. Usually right in front of the litter box. It's so awesome not having to sweep up litter daily. I have her on a MWF schedule too and that is more than enough to keep the place clean.  I recently got Nick, an i4+ for the upstairs. He's quieter. He's like Dixie in is planning and map reporting, so he's smart. It's very cool. He also gets the job done quickly. First day was like 1.5 hours learning. Now he's done in 50 minutes. The base sucks everything out so I don't have to tend to him as much as Finigan. He's in the main part of the house and it gets the most dirty. The dogs spend all there time here. The cat is up here most of the time. And we have two birds who send seeds everywhere. It's amazing how far from the cage those birds can flick seeds. And their feathers and drift everywhere too. Nick takes care of all that. I do need to manually get under the couch and behind and under furniture which I do once every month or so. But this robot is awesome. Saves me the day in and day out sweeping and vacuuming.  Having robots spend 3+ robot labor hours each day vacuuming is an awesome human labor saver. Once they've hit the whole house for a month or two I'm able to step them back to MWF schedules. Their brushes do a great job in the corners, better than me sweeping or vacuuming; mostly because they hit those corners every day and spend the time swirling that brush to work on it. That constant day in day out effort pays off over time. I really can't imagine going back to manually doing this. I look back at the hours I spent doing it thinking that was Neanderthal days. I look forward to telling my grand kids how I used to walk to school uphill in the snow everyday, dial rotary phones, select music off of CD's I had to manually put into a machine, and now, that I spent hours sweeping the floors in the good old days.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 823, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Robert Jordan'}}, {'title': 'Works great!', 'body': \"I purchased my first Roomba and picked the Combo i5+ model. I was worried that my dog would try to attack this, but I ran it the first few times at when I was home to keep an eye on him. It did not bother him. He is scared of vacuums and typically barks at my upright ones. It took a while for my Roomba to map around my house. I have a lot of primitive decors around my house. It eventually figured its way around. At first, I had the base set against the wall near my dining room table. This caused some issues as it was getting tied up going around the chairs. I since moved the base to a safer area, and it has been navigating better. I love the app and that I can chose to run it when I'm at work and no one is home. I love the fact that I no longer have to sweep my hardwoods every night. It also goes under my bed and saves me from having to move it to clean under. This one is self-emptying so once it done with its job its empty's itself into the dock's bag. I have used this now at least 20 time since my purchase and haven't had to change the bag yet.

I love my iRobot older mop so thought why not try the vacuum too. While it mapped the house first try amazingly well and works in a methodical pattern through the rooms it just doesn't do as good a job as my old Eufy that wandered randomly around my rooms and just had a remote to operate it. Pros: Great on hard floors, battery lasts a long time, great to be able to pick a single room or any configuration of rooms or all rooms on the app, easy to empty vacuum bags and install new, and it's patterned approach to cleaning a room ensures no spots are skipped. Cons: Not good with pet hair on carpets, ta!ler than my Eufy so can't get in and around and under all my furniture like my Eufy, expensive replacement parts, not able to operate it other than through the App and is dependent on Wi-Fi signal strength so pauses if signal isn't strong, has poor performance if an error occurs while running a job - it can't pick up where it left off (I always wind up sending it home and starting the room over as a new job). Cleaning performance diminishes the longer it runs so if you want it at its best in each room you're better off sending it to clean one room at a time or combining only a couple at a time. I use this as daily maintenance since we have pets and things can get messy quickly with them going in and out and shedding.  Overall it works, but I wish I had tried Eufy newer model instead.

Mine couldn’t have been easier, setup was a breeze. Also people complaining of noise? I actually couldn’t believe how quiet our i3 Roomba is. My son was watching tv while it vacuumed in the same room. Yes the emptying process into the bin is about as loud as a normal upright vacuum but that only last a few seconds. So far it returns right to its base for emptying and charging once finished. It got stuck only once under a low cabinet hutch, but that was really my fault as you do have to kinda “ROOMBA PROOF” your home if you expect it to work independently. It has great suction. We have three cats and it picked up the litter great. Hardly anything left. Now mind you, you do have to do a deep upright vacuum clean every so often. I mean I think people have way too High expectations if they think they will never vacuum again. Yes it’s strong and yes it does a fantastic job of maintaining the place till I can deep clean again but it’s not a replacement for that. It’s simply for me a day to day maintenance which means I don’t have to vacuum every day and when I do use my upright there’s much less to do. That’s very useful to me. I only had one weird run where it vacuumed only the kitchen(where home base is)and than after 6 minutes returned home and said job was “complete” Not sure if it got confused because it does literally have to map every time it goes out. Unlike the more expensive models that save the mapping info. However this does navigate quite well. I actually watched it for a couple runs and once it bumps and learns where the couch is or the table for example, it turns automatically and stops before it hits when it passes these obstacles again. I think for a very complex layout with many obstacles it does unbelievable. So cool to see it make its way all the way into our bedroom but than know how to travel all the way back to its base. I also saw it once impressively go between a stool there was barely enough room, vacuum under it and than make a 180 and left the way it came in without one bump. So yes once it learns and maps great and it does do as straight of lines possible which is nice and very efficient. The times you do see it doubling back or going out of the straight path is usually when it detects extra dirt which it than will circle back for. It also will tell you when it’s stuck and I love that I can set it to vacuum when I’m out. It’s a breeze to clean the brushes and everything is replaceable which I love. The app is simple but works fine and you can see after the job where it went and how long it took etc. I bought on cyber Monday for only $400 and I think it was a great deal and totally worth it. Its working as expected if not better. I will update if things change but as the title said so far it’s great! Love my New helper. UPDATE: ITS BEEN 2 YEARS. WOW TIME FLIES AND THIS VACUUM IS STILL DOING ITS THING. IF YOUR ON THE FENCE, DONT BE. ROOMBA BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME AND THEIR THE BEST AT IT. NO PROBLEMS TO REPORT AND THEY RECENTLY ADDING AN UPDATE TO ALLOW MAPPING WHICH MAKES THIS VALUED EVEN HIGHER. LOVE TELLING IT TO VACUUM SPECIFIED ROOMS NOW! AT $360 THIS IS A GREAT DEAL.

It really is like training a new pet - lots of work at first, and then you\\'ll still have accidents and ongoing training forever. Plus there are some bugs in the system to be worked on iRobot\\'s side. I\\'ll summarize our findings:  -Make sure to give him wide open clearance space in front. We started with him in a 4\\' wide hallway that our Eufy had no problem with, but Robert couldn\\'t find his way around. - For some reason, Robert won\\'t save a map after he runs. This means that if you start a new job, it\\'s like he\\'s learning your house from scratch again. If you want him to be smart, you have to set him out on a \"Smart Map\" run, which is just like a normal run except with no suctioning. There, he\\'ll go around your house like a blind idiot bumping into things and eventually come out with a cool map that you can divide up into rooms and he\\'ll follow from then on. But why this requires a separate run and can\\'t be saved after a regular run I don\\'t know. - Speaking of the Smart Map run, this may take you 3-4 (or 8) times before you get it. Because he wanders around like a more basic, unintelligent robovac during the smart run, it means he misses a lot, gets stuck a lot, and generally causes you frustration. Each smart run will return a map of what he covered, and if you\\'re like us, he\\'ll often miss entire rooms or sections of the house. We had to run it several times before he came back with an adequate coverage map. And I say adequate because it only loosely resembles our actual floor plan, but it\\'s close enough. Oh, and make sure to pick up everything off your floor - slippers and cat toys will screw him up. - Once you get a map you\\'re happy with though, the app is pretty neat in how it lets you draw rooms. He\\'ll suggest rooms for you too, but those didn\\'t make any sense. It\\'s a little quirky drawing lines in the app to section off your house (e.g. sometimes lines go all the way across your house, sometimes they\\'ll stop at a room), but the experience is cool and rewarding. - Once you have your smart map drawn, then the cool part happens: you can create a bunch of different schedules to vacuum different parts of your house. For example, our entryway gets vacuumed every day because of foot traffic, but the bedrooms only need 3 times a week. This feature alone is a HUGE benefit and way cooler than our previous Eufy 11s Robovac. Almost worth the cost of the device itself. - Once you have your map, the vacuum experience is pretty good. He\\'ll follow your map but still bump into a lot of stuff (I assume the \"edges\" of the objects he mapped are pretty fuzzy). It is cool to see him go down a straight line, bump into the wall, and turn around down another straight line. Gives you a feeling of pride that you trained him well. The suction power is good too - picks up all the litter my 4 cats leave scattered around - better than the Eufy. And it\\'s neat to watch him stop in the middle of job, go to the bathroom (or go for a battery charge) and then come right back where he left off. - Keep in mind this is all relative. He still moves like a half-blind old dog. Bumps into things. Stops and stands still for 30 seconds at a time like he\\'s lost. Spins around in circles going nowhere. He gets stuck on weird things - will chirp at me that he\\'s stuck on a cliff when he can\\'t find his way off of a thick rug. Bumps into or rolls over everything you left on the floor. But like an old dog, he mostly knows his way around and can make it back to his bed and take a dump by himself. - Speaking of... you\\'ve heard other reviewers say he\\'s pretty loud when he goes to the toilet. But you don\\'t understand. When I say loud, I mean LOUD. Like a jet engine in your house going off for 20 seconds. And sometimes one flush isn\\'t enough. I\\'ll regularly hear 3 jet engines taking off in a row. During his normal vacuum run he\\'s not exactly quiet either - much louder than my Eufy and too loud to hold a conversation near. Like a normal upright vacuum. - The app is really nice to use. Friendly, designed well, drawing maps and scheduling jobs is easy. Get lots of notifications on Robert\\'s status (successful job, stuck, problems with the toilet, etc) which is neat. Robert likes to talk. Probably the highlight of the product. I also really like that you can specify if you want him to cover a room twice instead of once, for when you\\'re extra dirty.  All that said, there are still bugs: - Since day 1, Robert tells me that the dust bag is full nearly every day. Which is a lie. Robert is a liar. Not only is that impossible after one day, but it forces me to go check the bag and I can visually see it\\'s still mostly empty. Usually this just means taking the bag out and putting it right back in, which thankfully is easy, but required because he won\\'t clear that error until you do. - I\\'ve also gotten a few complaints that the pipes are clogged. I know Robert takes big dumps, but this is a lie too. Unclogging involves getting out a screw driver and taking the base apart. Three times I\\'ve done this and each time there was absolutely nothing in the pipes. I don\\'t know what that\\'s about.  Overall: I think this is a very nice upgrade over the Eufy 11s. We genuinely feel like we don\\'t need to vacuum as much, which we didn\\'t always feel with the Eufy. Works greats on litter and cat hair on bare floors - carpets are iffy. Robert can be a pain sometimes but at least he makes the experience fun, just like an old pet.  The promise of a hands-off experience though doesn\\'t get met - I have to help Robert along almost daily.

I am a slave to my vacuum as I have to dogs that shed constantly so vacuuming every single day is just part of my routine. But after many hours of reviewing and researching, I gave iRobot a try and I am thankful I did! It has been a full week I had it and it works great. For a non dyson (strongest suction vacuum) it has decent suction for hard wood floors and even area rugs. Works slowly and when it does bump furniture, it is very gentle. Noise is a minimum compared to a \"true\" vacuum. My one golden retriever is DEATHLY afraid of it and runs to go outside the minute I turn it on.  Pros: Picks up all pet hair on hard wood and most in the area rugs Decent suction for a robot vacuum Quieter than a traditional vacuum Goes \"home\" when press home button as long as vacuum wasn\\'t picked up and placed down as that disorients it Easy to clean all parts Ease of set up with iPhone  Cons: As all reviews say. This is smaller type of vacuum so expect (based on square footage of area) to have to empty dust bin depending on square footage of house and how dirty floors are. Vacuum will alert you when dustbin full.  Cycle of vacuum sometimes is off. It may go back and forth in a given area over and over despite being a large expanse of floor in front of it. Sometimes gets frustrating and you need to pick it up and place it in other parts of the floor it has not gotten to. However, I have learned to just put it on for an hour or so and let it go where it needs to go. If left on its own for the time, it will navigate all over floor, under couches, under chairs I know the more expensive line has dust bin emptying and \"mapping\" of floor plan so it covers the entire floor but I did not buy this to replace my dyson animal cinematic traditional vacuum. I bought this to keep the pet hair under control so I can take 1 day off of vacuuming every other day and let the robot pick up the pet hair.

The more it explored, the more software updates were downloaded, and the more efficiently it performed. Here are the pros and cons of owning this model: PROS: - Software updates that have greatly improved the i3\\'s capabilities. - - Scheduled automatic cleaning is easy to setup in the app. - Unlike the more expensive Roomba models, it works in the dark. Lights off? curtains closed? No problem. - Sucks up a lot of dirt, lint, and hair from our floors. Long hair (we have a lot) collects at the ends of his rollers and is easily removed. - We have 2 steps down from the main level to our family room. It vacuums to the edge, but has never jumped. - The app isn\\'t needed for a cleaning. For our family room, we don\\'t use the app. We just set it in the room, press the button and away it goes, cleaning in an efficient manner. - Durable. Sucked up a USB cord and a sun hat string that had been left out on the floor. These items got tangled up, jamming the robot and causing it to shut down, but no damage was done. - Widely available replacement parts... for a day may a come when his little mustache stops whisking dirt into his big suck face. CONS - It took 5 days of assigning it to \"clean everywhere\" before it accurately mapped our single-story 1500sf home, then allowed me to divide up and label rooms/areas, and the ability to assign it to clean specific rooms. - It can\\'t clean our whole house in one charge. It goes back to the station recharges itself and then finishes the job. - The main con is having patience with the robot exploring and the software updates (my experience below). It will take some time for all of the features to become available. Make sure you have strong Wi-Fi signal throughout your house and send the robot out on cleaning runs and the updates will happen.  Software Updates: - The app and the robot started with limited functionality. After doing a few whole house cleanings over 3 days, it started getting updates and more features were added to the app. It took another few days before it was fully updated and had an accurate floor plan. While it was cleaning it was also doing a lot of exploring, going back over the same areas, pausing to ponder the universe, etc. I think this was part of preparation for the next software update regarding the mapping. After cleaning all accessible areas of my house a few times, a map appeared on the app and asked me if it was accurate or if the robot should remap my house. Some parts of rooms were cut off or shaped weird, but I clicked \"accept\" anyway. It then prompted me to add/delete partition lines to divide the house up into rooms. The lines can be moved any direction and rotated 360° so you have good control over creating different areas. After doing a few more whole house cleanings the map updated itself and accurately represented our floor plan. In the end I\\'m glad we had patience with it. It cleans great now and it\\'s efficient.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 323, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Bert'}}, {'title': 'Works great, but there are some \"gotcha\\'s\"', 'body': 'This is my 3rd Roomba. I had one of the very first generation Roombas, a 610 that I used for a long time, and now this one. Overall, Roombas are great for what they are if you have realistic expectations. This one brings some great new additions. Firstly, the room mapping feature is pretty good. It means you no longer need to confine your Roomba to a single room like you used to have to do. You send your Roomba on a mapping run, let it finish, then name the rooms it finds. It did a pretty good job in my house the first time. My house is a rambler that was built in the 60s and added on in the 80s. There are doors everywhere, so I thought it would struggle with that - but it didn\\'t. Once you have all of those rooms named, you can open the app and send it to clean any of them one at a time if you\\'d like. You can also set up a group where you decide which rooms it will clean in which order. It goes and does it, and returns to its base. Easy Peasy. I\\'m a Google user, so I LOVE the fact that I can just say \"Hey Google, vacuum the living room\" and it runs off and does it. It probably does the same with Alexa. Secondly, the fact that it can actually find its charger base is a godsend. My old 610 would try to go back to the base, but never actually find it, so I was constantly playing \"where\\'s the Roomba?\". It\\'s funny at first, but get\\'s annoying really quickly. Third, they changed the brushes. The older style had a brush. The newer Roombas have these rubber sweepers that don\\'t get clogged nearly as much as the old ones did. They also seem to find more dirt.  Gotcha #1: The collection bin is much smaller than the older versions. If you don\\'t buy the auto-empty base (like me), and you have a dog (like me), you\\'ll find that it struggles to do more than one or two rooms without aborting because the bin is full. I suppose this is a planned \"bug\" to get you to buy the auto-empty base thing. It\\'s not the end of the world, but so far for me, I haven\\'t been able to allow it to clean more than 3 rooms at a time. Then I have to empty and clean the bin. The good news here is that you get a notification that the Roomba couldn\\'t finish the job you gave it. Once you clean out the bin and put it back on the charger, it goes back and finished up.  Gotcha #2: the filters. There is one permanent filter on here, and it seems to get clogged very easily. It\\'s not tough to clean it, but you have to wash it with water and let it dry. That means you have to wait a while between when you clean that filter and when you\\'re able to use your Roomba again. There is also one non-permanent filter. It\\'s very small and also easily clogged. I know they expect you to change these filters a lot, but I\\'m not going to pay for filters over and over again, so I\\'ll always try to clean them as much as possible first. The way this one is made is different from the old style, so it\\'s much harder to cleanout. Again, not the end of the world, but be aware that you\\'re probably going to want some replacement filters at some point, and you never know how much that will cost you later.  Gotcha #3: they never changed the charging base since the last version. It\\'s far too light, and the pads that are supposed to be able to magically hold the base in place when the Roomba tries to dock are insufficient for the job. Several times, I\\'ve found my Roomba trying to dock, but it pushed the dock sideways and couldn\\'t do it. *update* I\\'ve used this almost every day since I got it, and it seems to have figured it out - or at least I haven\\'t had that problem since.  Gotcha #4: Floor rugs. For some reason, this new Roomba seems to struggle with my floor rugs much more than my old 610. I\\'m not entirely sure why, but it has a tendency to flip them up. So far, it hasn\\'t caused much of an issue because it eventually figures it out, but my old Roomba had no problem with any of the area rugs in my house. *update* I replaced some of the older worn-out rugs in my house. Problem solved.  Overall, I\\'d say this was worth an upgrade from my older 610 just for the room mapping feature.

I was stuck between this Roomba, and the Bisselle brand. Ultimately we settled on this one as it is capable of returning to the charger to recharge, and continue the job when it’s ready (This works amazingly well) right out of the box this felt significantly more premium, had some good weight to it, and looked absolutely quality. I had work that morning (Had it delivered at 6 A.M.) so I quickly set it up, and scheduled it to clean. As I was leaving for work I heard it kick on, it’s very quiet on carpet to the point you won’t notice it (It is however extremely loud of hard floor) I left for work and started my day.  5hours later (It was 5 hours for 2 reasons, the first being it had almost no battery out of the box, so it had to charge twice, the second being there was quite a bit of heavy dust in the carpets that the knock off brand had left, nowadays it finishes in 3 hours) I get a notification on my phone saying it completed the job, I took a look at the map of the downstairs and was impressed at how well mapped it was being about 98% accurate. I got home from work and was impressed at just how clean and neat the carpet was, it looked like when we first bought the house! With all the dust gone the carpet felt noticeably softer, and I almost felt bad stepping on the clean carpet.  I went to check the Roomba, it had picked up and incredible amount of dirt and hair (I got on the floor and tried to pick out any loose strand of hair our husky shed, after trying in 8 different places I only found 2 strands of hair) Amazed, I flipped over the Roomba to check the rollers, once again I was shocked at how good of a job it did, having only had 3-4 strands of my wife’s hair wrapped around the brushes (These came off easily, to this day I haven’t had any of her hair tangled around the brushes again)  So far both my wife and I are absolutely amazed by this little guy. I would highly recommend this, and will absolutely be purchasing the mopping Roomba when we replace the carpet with hard floor.  Pros- - Does the job right - Quiet on carpet - Battery life doesn’t matter since it can return to the charger - Extremely thorough - Brushes do an amazing job making up for low suction power - Decent sized recovery tank, and great design for easy disposal - Great mapping - Neat straight lines  Cons- - Very loud on hard floors - Recovery tank could be a bit bigger - Dual sweeping brushes would be nice - Stays half an inch away from the very edges, meaning the baseboards aren’t cleaned properly - Occasionally have to take the rollers off to clean the hair inside them (Still far better than our knock off brand Roomba)', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 76, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Zek'}}, {'title': \"Worst Robot Vacuum I've Ever Owned\", 'body': \"I have owned quite a few robot vacuums in my life and until this one, I had always stuck with cheaper models because I didn't see the value in the more expensive models. I finally decided to give a recognized name brand a go and Try the IRobot Roomba i5. And I have to tell you, what an utter disappointment. I can't find one good thing to say about this hunk of junk.  For starters, it is NOISY. Forget about letting it run while you are home. Which is the only time you are going to want to run it since it has no sensor to detect any kind of pet messes and you definitely don't want the experience of a thin layer of dog vomit spread across your entire house.  The detection system on this thing is laughable. It is supposed to sense objects, walls, etc. But instead it just aimlessly wanders around banging into everything unlucky enough to be in its path.  If you are like me and have a dog that sheds a lot, this will get hair into every place you can think of and it will literally stop the brushes from spinning as it gets wrapped around everything that moves. The side brush no longer works because it got hair wound around the motor shaft and burned it out. This happened within ONE MONTH of purchase.  The LIDAR mapping is a joke. I ran it a couple of dozen times and it failed to ever draw anything that even remotely resembled the layout of my home. So no chance at actually having a schedule for cleaning specific rooms.  My home is about 1200 ft2 on the main floor which is where this hunk of #!@% resides. The battery life has this thing relegated to taking about 3 trips at about 90 minutes each to do a mediocre job of cleaning. So you are going to sit there for 5-6 hours per day listening to this thing. Which as I previously mentioned, it is LOUD.  I have purchased robot vacuums for a third of the price of the Roomba i5 that out perform this thing by a wide margin. If this is the quality that iRobot puts out, I can't fathom how they are even still in business. I suppose there are a lot of households out there and you can build a zesty enterprise on just burning everyone once. There is definitely a miniscule amount of care and thought that goes into their machines.  If I could, I would return this thing. I tried to give it a chance. I really wanted to like it.

We liked the idea of it automatically cleaning up after them.  It was extremely easy to setup the app on my phone and the Roomba.

After the mapping run it had no trouble returning to it's home base. I went into the app and edited the room dividers and named the rooms.  We have it scheduled to clean the high traffic areas daily and the whole floor twice a week. I also added it to my Alexa app so we can use voice control as well.

However, but it\\'s worse in a lot of ways.  The app is really glitchy: - It took forever to get a Smart Map saved; had to reach out to support - It usually can\\'t connect if the vacuum hasn\\'t been used in 24 hours, I have to go reboot it every day - The status of the vacuum on the app and the actual status of the vacuum mismatch a lot - The settings aren\\'t always actually set; it\\'ll pause a job for a \"full\" dustbin even though I have that setting turned off According to the internet, some of this might be caused by using 5 Ghz Wi-Fi, but literally every other device I own works fine on it; I\\'m not setting up an entire new Wi-Fi network just for a vacuum!

For Christmas this year, we decided to take the plunge and get one to save us some housework (or at least reduce the frequency that we'd need to sweep. We have all laminate flooring in a single story house, so it's practically a requirement to sweep daily.  With all the options on the market, and rabid fans for each brand, it's very difficult to get honest information on what which ones within given price brackets win out and which features are really important to have. Ultimately, we opted to give the roomba a shot since during the black friday sales, nearly all competitors had their pricing roughly around the same levels for similar devices. We opted for the i3 for highest suction power to lowest cost. In hindsight, I wish we had gone with the i7 for the ability to map our house out and designate zones for specific cleaning (would have been a excellent feature for days when I was in meetings and the roomba could not get to my room to clean during its scheduled time).  As for the actual device itself, my expectations were very tempered for considering what we were purchasing. Fortunately, I can say that we have been very satisfied with Nagatha's performance (kudos to anyone that gets the reference). It is surprisingly thorough considering the i3 re-maps the floors every time it cleans. Only on particularly high traffic days do we ever notice particles on the floor, and that's usually hours after it has made it rounds.  The only cons I have (if it really can be considered a con) is that it picks up some much animal fur and particle junk that its not uncommon for the bin to be full and have to cancel it's clean until the bin is cleared. Having the option to resume a clean after the bin is emptied would be nice, and not have it start all over again (A full clean of our house usually takes 2 full charges and roughly 2.5 hours of cleaning with roughly an hour of charge time between that). Being able to pause a clean and send roomba back to its base to charge while on pause, then resume when ready (because sometimes I have longer meetings during the scheduled clean times) would be a nice to have feature so we don't have to start the whole clean over. Last complaint is the cost of replacement parts. Considering the glut of off market replacement options and how well these cheaper alternatives seem to perform/review, iRobot should seriously consider making replacement parts (like filters) either reusable or competitive with alternatives.  Overall, 5/5 based on my tempered expectations of what these things would actually get done. Quite satisfied with it's performance so far.

In a word, I\\'m \"unimpressed\", but if were to use more words I would also say I was annoyed, aggravated, exasperated, perplexed, angry, and surprised (both in good and bad ways).  Let me just cut to the chase -- I returned it. The main reason why I returned it was because the much touted \"Smart Mapping\" feature simply didn\\'t work. With the i3 model, you can\\'t have the vac just learn the Smart Map of your house while it vacuums. Instead you have to send it out on a mapping only mission, where it doesn\\'t vacuum at all and instead uses the battery just to find it\\'s way around your entire house with the idea that once it\\'s done it will creat this editable \"Smart Map\" so the next time you want use the vac you can just tell it, \"Clean the kitchen, living room, and family room\". After wasting a total of 8 hours (4 hours twice) supposedly \"unlocking the Smart Map feature\" by creating my first Smart Map, I still had no editable Smart Map, even though in the history it showed that he vac went literally all over my 3800s/f home.  Okay, so I can\\'t use one feature -- why is that so bad? Well, the problem is that all these new Roomba models are completely based on that feature! Since none of them use a random vac pattern anymore, they need to be able use a map to know when their job is done. Unless you successfully create a Smart Map, that job everytime will be your entire house. Since there is no other way to like remote control these vacs start in a particular room or only clean part of the house, you have to be able use the Smart Map feature. Also, because it use row by row movement instead of random, the first time the vac runs in your house it takes a LONG time to figure things out, so unless you want it to take the same long time every time it needs to have a map to move around and do the job faster, even if it\\'s doing your whole house. Another reason why this feature is important is because I also bought the iRobot Braava Jet M6 mopper, which also uses Smart Map and is supposed to share information back and forth between the Rooba i3 and the Braava Jet M6, specifically the map. Not being able to tell a Roomba to go vac one room is one thing, but the Braava Jet M6 can\\'t mop your whole house every time. You HAVE to be able to tell the Braava to go mop like only one or two rooms. Well, the Braava does figure out the Smart Map as it mops, so it will eventually learn the whole house. However, I was hoping to use the supposedly quicker Smart Map creator of the Roomba i3 to create a Smart Map of my house to immediately share with the Braava. But nope -- that\\'s not happening. So now I have to wait for the Braava to run like 4 continued mopping/charging cycles before it will finally learn the Smart Map of my house.  So because that one feature isn\\'t working, this \"high end\" original robo vac actually performs much worse than my much cheaper (yet better featured?) Coredy hybrid vac/mop that it was supposed to be replacing. I welcomed the Coredy vac back with open arms after dealing with all the Rooba frustration/annoyance. But before you think I\\'m just being picky about this one feature, the i3 has numerous other issues, too:  1. It wasn\\'t able to go over a single rug in my house. Not a single one. No matter if it\\'s a rubberish mat, low shag, cotton like cloth, etc. it wouldn\\'t transition from the tile/hardwood floor to the rug. Sometimes it would roll it up under the wheels, stranding the vac with its butt up in the air until it screams for help. Someetimes it would suck up the corners of the rugs in the \"no tangle dual roller system\" (I don\\'t think they know what \"no tangle\" means). It\\'s so bad at transitions it wouldn\\'t even go over a lamp cord on the floor and there are several rooms in the house that go from tile to wood so they have a raised tile or wood transition, and it would get stuck on top of that. Seriously. It\\'s only like 1/4\" high and it could barely get over that. 2. Although it had trouble going over tiny transitions, sometimes it would actually do almost like a kind of wheelie going over things it shouldn\\'t and would actually strand itself with most/all wheels off the ground. 3. The i3 is surprisingly tall, wide, and just big. Basically it fits under VERY little in my house -- including just the kitchen cabinet overhangs. It also won\\'t fit between my rather standard dining room chair legs, kitchen table chair legs, or bar stool feet. It also gets stuck/wedged trying to go under my rocking recliner chair. My Coredy robot vac fits in all these places (and more) no problem! 4. I cannot emphasize how annoying it is that you cannot remote control this vac, like to get it where you want it to clean, or if it misses something and you want it to go back, or it gets stuck, etc. There should be a way to control/steer this vac from the app (or at least from an included dedicated wireless remote control). This is especially needed when the Smart Map feature simply doesn\\'t work. 5. The dust cup on the i3 is less than half the size of the dust cup on my Coredy vac. That\\'s actually okay though (not really) because it picks up less debris than my Coredy vac does, so although it\\'s difficult to determine a true suction comparison (since iRobot only lists it\\'s suction power as compared to its own 600 series Roombas -- like 3x, 10x, etc.), I suspect that my Coredy vac has stronger suction. 6. The battery on the i3 doesn\\'t last as long as my Coredy vac does. I don\\'t know what the specs are of either batteries, but I know it\\'s must be significantly different because the Coredy seems to clean better (stronger suction) and the battery lasts almost twice as long. 7. Even though the advertise it as specifically NOT doing this anymore, the i3 still slams into things just as much as I remember my first Roomba doing over a decade ago. Again, my Coredy vac doesn\\'t do this, so although they both use a bumper technique for navigation (rather than lidar, lasers, cameras, etc.) the Coredy is much more gentle. I thought my wife was going to destroy the i3 when it started repeatedly slamming into her beloved Wolf oven (KABANG KABANG KABANG!)  I\\'m sure there\\'s negatives I\\'m forgetting, but that\\'s most of it. It was mostly an annoying/aggravating experience.  Okay, on the positive side -- there\\'s only one. I\\'m mildly impressed with the straight line row by row vacuuming. I\\'m one of those people who will go nuts watching the usual robot vac randomly clean the floor completely missing a big chunk of debris for HOURS. This new method/technique should definitely solve that syndrome, but unfortunately without the Smart Map feature it\\'s just not a very viable method of cleaning.  So, my summary would be the same as it\\'s been since I bought a Roomba over 10 years ago. Do not buy a lesser model Roomba. You can spend the same amount and get a really high end, well featured non-iRobot brand that will do a much better job. That being said, even though I could buy it, I\\'m not going to buy iRobot\\'s top of the line Roomba either. I simply do not trust that will work as advertised any better than their lower end models do (don\\'t), and they definitely haven\\'t earned my trust in their products enough to pay $1000 for their top of the line model.', 'rating': 2, 'helpfulVotes': 241, 'reviewer': {'name': 'C.

Very often, it\\'s clear the robot \"knows something I do not know\". Specifically, it will cut a job short and \"go home\" without sending any sort of message (to the phone app) about what has gone wrong. (Spoiler alert: it\\'s usually an \"empty the bin\" warning situation. But really, it\\'s not that the bin needs to be emptied; it\\'s instead that you need to \"tap out\" the dust from the detachable filter thingy, which is a sub-part of the dustbin you take out...  6. Take out the \"rollers\" regularly, to untangle hair. (They\\'re the light green and dark green rollers, on the underside. Detaching isn\\'t particularly intuitive; there\\'s a small, green lever-button, to push sideways.) Check and de-hair/de-fur both ends of both rollers, most especially, as well as the main/central roller parts. Learn how to manage various release and re-insertion techniques, via practice, b/c they are not designed in a way that would make them intuitive or obvious.) Do similar checks, regularly, on the various wheels and that three-pronged brush-whisker thingy, that you can more easily see on the underside, too.  5. Despite previously having mapped the \"house\", and being told to stay ON this map, only, occasionally Toto (whom we perhaps should have named \"Dora\") goes rogue. It goes into \"exploring\" mode - yet this adds absolutely nothing to the \"mapping\", for this (low-grade) iRobot model (i3 Evo). i.e., it knows it\\'s mapping something new, but it cannot just \"add this to the existing map\" (sigh). It just means Toto/Dora inexplicably wanders and is thereby likely to tangle into cords or shoelaces or similar, despite your very best efforts to have told it, \"Please don\\'t go outside this region, sweetie!\". i.e., do not trust your \"map\" will be paid attention too, sadly...  4. About that \"initial mapping\" deal/experiance. It\\'s - really, really terrible. The worst part is that you\\'ll simply have no idea \"if things are going as expected or not\" until it has completed some Byzantine process, on its own (with you out of this loop, entirely). Also, definitely expect to have to do that via a few attempts, and then breath calmly, recognizing \"it is not you; it\\'s the stupid robot.\" If you lift the robot (to help it, when it gets stuck) or touch it in any way, it doesn\\'t give you any warning \"things are now bad, and this map won\\'t work\" - but also, then the map totally doesn\\'t come out in the end, either. So, stay calm and just assume it is very, very, very, very stupid. Do yoga poses, or something. Stay calm. ;-) What I did was: clear out EVERYTHING that might tangle. Block all hallway access points, via large, immovable physical blockades. Take all chairs and pull them off the floor. Limit the search space to 1,000 sq feet or so, max. This finally got a map, for me. Then all was good (kind of; see item 6, before), and you finally MIGHT get a map and can then section it into sub-regions.  3. Do not run the robot unless you are around to monitor it. It can get way, way off, on the map. Also, it routinely gets into a mode where it thinks the dustbin is full (before it truly is), then runs home and sits there. Which is fine - but there is never any message on my darn phone - nor via audio from the robot - when this happens. So, Toto/Dora just \"gets an idea in their head\" and goes off-script, with no explanation. Be prepared that this will happen - frequently. Again, treat Toto/Dora like a toddler, with a lot of patience required.  2. So, there\\'s this assuming thing that happens where pet fur gets rolled into a little tuft, but doesn\\'t get picked up. This is better that nothing. Be prepared to walk around any carpeted areas, picking up the tufts. Or just pull out a vacuum, to snarf them en masse, after a robo-run.  1. Be sure to \"tap out\" the filter! When you \"empty the bin\" - DO NOT JUST \"EMPTY THE BIN\". You also need to pull out the little, white filter thingy (with all those crenulations or whatever - the diagonally-peaked features, of the little filter). You can pull that filter out. Go \"whack, whack, whack!\" on the side of a hard surface (inside the kitchen sink, or inside a trashcan - although works better with a more rigid surface, thus the kitchen sink suggestion there). Totodora was barfing up for quite a while, on day 4 or so of running, before I figured this out. (Sigh...)  Aside from those minor details and concerns, great(?) product.  Well, I mean shucks - I am actually pulling out the vacuum and sweeping the floor now.

We live on a small farm and we are always tracking in dirt and debris and I feel like I can never keep up with the floors. Plus we were planning on getting a puppy soon and I was envisioning all the extra hair and dirt that would come with that. It came a day earlier than expected and in good condition. I was a bit skeptical at first...it is round and corners are, well...not. We have an open concept home with lots of corners and angles. I\\'ve only used it on the main floor and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. While it doesn\\'t get \"everything\" it does get a majority and does better than expected.  Pros: Set up was easy. I set it up on the charger, downloaded the app and let it fully charge. The house was pretty messy the first time I ran it but it did a great job. Even the entry way rug looked spotless. Despite my pessimism, it really does get into nooks and crannies. There are very few places it can\\'t reach. And if all I have to do is vacuum those few places every now and then, I am very satisfied. It also gets under furniture and my stove, which I will reluctantly admit have not seen a vacuum in a long time. I wasn\\'t sure it would get into every room, but somehow it manages. I am usually home when I run it and I pick up things on the floor to give it more space to clean. It does the wood floors and area rugs with out an issue and even managed to climb up a bit to our wood stove hearth.  Cons: It bangs into things. It is supposed to and it will usually find its way around any object, but it is a bit annoying to hear it run into walls and furniture. It did get stuck on the hearth last time and I had to rescue it, so not so comfortable running it if I\\'m not around. The dust collection compartment is small and is usually pretty packed by the time it is done. Right now I run it about every other day so there won\\'t be too much stuff to over fill it. Once the puppy gets older and starts shedding, I will probably do it every day. I am not sure how \"deep cleaning\" it is. But it picks up all the surface dirt. After the first time it ran, I walked around expecting to see stuff it missed but really couldn\\'t find anything. It also runs for a long time. I could vacuum the whole house before it finished half the first floor, IF I had the time, which I don\\'t, hence the Roomba.  Overall, I am very satisfied with it. It\\'s going to be a big time saver. I would give it 4.5 stars, but since I can\\'t I\\'ll give 5 since it does what it states it will do and any cons, in my opinion, are minor.', 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': 24, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Cindy'}}, {'title': 'Absolutely useless.

This thing learned the layout of my place pretty fast (within a couple of days), and I didn't really see it get stuck anywhere that it could not navigate out of. I will say that you do need to prep by picking up small items, picking up loose cords, and maybe blocking off outlets with a bunch of cords on the ground. But that's not really a hassle (at least not to me). I found that putting the Roomba on a cleaning schedule was the best thing for me so that it could clean while I was at work...and I took a couple of days to see how my dogs reacted to the Roomba before letting it go on its own because I did not want my dogs destroying it. But, I would advise having animals kenneled or in some closed room while the Roomab cleans just to be safe. Still, this thing picked up A LOT of hair! It even got those stricky corners on the wall that seem to accumulate EVERYTHING. Just remember to empty the Roomba after every cleaning session and also clean the bristles.

We have a large Husky/Lab mix and a smaller Boston/Chihuahua mix. So I started looking and kinda had sticker shock. I love my Shark products, so I started looking at the self emptying models. Ended up buying this on Warehouse deals to give it a try, it's refurbished. It came clean and with new brushes/filters. I liked this model due to the self cleaning roller. We have that on the vacuum we own and it's great. My hair is shoulder length and it's always wrapped around the beater bar of my previous vacuums, that this feature was a must. On initial operation it's fun to watch as it maps your home. It takes several times and it will create a map, so when you download the app to your phone you can ask it to clean certain areas of the home or every room. That's a nice feature. I also own echo dot's, so I have programmed Alexa to work with the Sharkbot we call it, and can start cleaning using Alexa commands, it's a bit wonky and I guess you have to use the right words to get it to start, and I'm still working on that. Our house here in the desert is about 1200 sq ft, one level. The vacuum maneuvers everywhere, under the dresser, endtables, dining table and chairs, vacuums the tile floors as well as the carpeted rooms. It will vacuum over the throw rugs as well, sometimes not disturbing them and sometimes bunching them up in the bathrooms on the tile floors. One area of concern for us is in the laundry room. The washer and dryer are recessed in a 2 inch drop just wide enough for the appliances, that's the tricky area for this. The wheel will get stuck and I'll get an alert on my phone and the robot will tell you it's stuck. You can pick it up and resume cleaning or tell it to go back to the dock. There is a magnetic strip you can buy and that is considered a boundary, but I have not ordered that yet. Mine being refurbished didn't come with that. I do know some of the new units have that included. The robot vac cleans in nice lines and you can see the tracks after it cleans on the carpet. It's kinda fun to watch. It's very quiet on the carpet, the tile is louder due to the grout lines. My robot empties twice for my house, and I have it on normal cleaning. There are adjustments in the app for a heavier cleaning option as well. The vacuum docks itself and then it empties using a loud suction to suction hair and dirt into the canister on top. There's a viewing window so you can see how full it is. It compacts the hair pretty well in the canister on top. I highly recommended using the app on your smartphone with this, so you can use the advanced features like scheduling, Alexa, and and adjusting which rooms it cleans and what suction power you want. The vacuum does not pick up the little fluff bits from my dogs toys when they de fluff them, but that's ok, and again I have it on normal suction, so I will have to dry a heavier cleaning option. The robot is not scuffed all along the edges now, as it did get stuck one time under the dresser. I love that this does under the beds and endtables though. That's great for me. I run this everyday and have reduced my main vacuuming down to once or twice a week from everyday. I purchased the added warranty, just because I'm not familiar with these types of products, and it only had a 90 warranty for refurbished. If you're curious I'd definitely recommend this. As a matter of fact, My Mom just bought the newest self empty model at the local Club warehouse, paid more than I did, but her canister is half the size of mine. So I'm glad I got this one, with 2 dogs and alot of hair. No it doesn't do the suction of my upright Shark but it does very well, and for that I'm thankful.

The concept is fantastic and if Shark had better customer service, quality control and universal part replacement, I would recommend. As it stands, buy a unit from Eufy. For a lesser brand, everything about the unit is superior. Universal parts, stronger suction, quieter operation. I have nothing but buyer's remorse for purchasing this model from Amazon, and now I'm spending nearly $40 more just to try to get more than 4 months life out of this thing.

I had a dozen or so pieces of confetti sized paper that fell from my paper shredder onto my area rug and it failed to pick them all up after multiple passes directly over them.  This vacuum struggles to get any debris that lies along the edge of my area rug. It appears to have programed itself to straddle the rug and bare floor, and the suction is not strong enough over the difference between the 2 surfaces.

I have had some very interesting occurances happen since buying this unit 2 weeks ago and putting it through the paces. I have 6 cats, 4 are long haired. I have waist length hair. A lot of hair around here.  Right away I had problems. I could not get the app to work. It would crash. I got this on a Friday, Shark has a phone number, but it was not open until Monday. so I charged the unit up. You can run the unit directly from the unit itself without the app, so you don\\'t need the app, you don\\'t need a smartphone. This really isn\\'t catastropic, but you cannot schedule cleanings or anything, you have to push a button on the vac called \"Clean\" and it will start vacuuming manually each time. Just sort of irritating when I wanted to schedule it to clean daily when I\\'m at work. There was another thing that happened the next day that was shocking but I will get to that in a minute.  1. Refurbished - I bought this refurbished. It has to charge up, depending on if the one you get is charged, you may have to charge it for several hours first. 2. When you buy it, it has to map out your house, before it gets more efficient, so it might get lost or run out of power before it makes it way back to the power station, apparently the first few times, or get caught up on things. Again, this can continue to happen multiple times that it will mess up. I\\'m finding that it will still do so. 3. It doesn\\'t come with the magnetic tape strip stuff, to block off any areas you don\\'t want it to go. Order it separately, and order 3M double sided tape to put the magnetic tape down with. The magnetic tape works great. I have a cat scratcher tree with a wood base, and the Shark, for some unholy reason, for several minutes, would continue to go up onto the edge of that thing. It was SO LOUD, then it would back off and go up onto it again from a slightly different angle, until it had gone around the entire unit. This would take 15 minutes. It made such a loud grinding noise. I edged that thing with the tape. I also put the tape around an area of flooring that\\'s in rough shape and coming up (needs replacing) that I thought the Shark might get hung up on. Any areas like these, you can manually vacuum. 4. I noticed in the beginning, it had problems with (I think it was code 6) it was the front bumper. I looked up videos on how to fix it. Mainly, if you grasp the front bumper and lightly shake it, it would come out of the code. I think in shipping, it may have jammed it to start with. Then during the first couple of cycles vacuuming, it hits items around the house harder than normal. I haven\\'t seen that code in a week or so. But it does still run out of power and leave itself stranded away from its base. but it\\'s not attached to the app?? Maybe it makes a difference. 5. It\\'s a lot of fun to shock pets with, when it first starts running. Don\\'t forget to have the video running to record it. It makes some electronic sounds that are astonishing to the pets :0 and then it starts. It\\'s very funny.  Back to the drama. So this refurbished unit. Day 2 Saturday, I was asleep, I work nights, at 9:30 am the Shark goes by itself, I had no idea this would happen. It does it again on Sunday at 9:30am. By Monday when I planned to call Shark, I was pretty entertained by the device and it\\'s antics, but I did really want the app to work. They told me my smartphone needed to be updated (I should turn on IOS automatic updates). No thank you. I should do a variety of other things, such as turn on Location Services (that did not help), I should delete app and redownload, I should delete app and download from their site (same app, same result), they would have a meeting about it and get back to me the next day. They did so, had me delete app and download from the App Store, again same result, app crash. The end result of ALL of these things did nothing, the app still crashes even now.  There are many people who cannot download automatic updates because employers do not authorize the updates until they have been checked over thoroughly to work with company software, or for any variety of reasons. The app should already work with previous IOS software that is quite recent. In any case, the Shark does work manually, with no smartphone at all, no wifi, no internet, it just isn\\'t nearly as fun. It will map out your house just the same, it will return to the base, sometimes you bring it to the base, not that big a deal. There is a button on the top of the vacuum unit that says \"Clean\". There are videos online showing that you should use robot vacs this way, anyway, because they transmit you and the inside of your house, like a wifi camera, so perhaps it\\'s best NOT to attach it to the app or the internet.  Here\\'s what Shark had to say about the ghost cleanings at 9:30am: They didn\\'t confirm for me if it indeed was the schedule of the previous owners, but it had to be, right? I had no access into the app. They did say they could see it scheduled, they could delete the schedule, if I didn\\'t like it, or they could change it to another time. I said, WAIT! Don\\'t touch it. :) I thought, my gosh, if I can\\'t access the app, I at least want SOMETHING for a daily cleaning programmed in there!! Besides, I was used to it by then.  So what are the cleaning results? How are the floors? I have hard wood floors throughout, and linoleum in the kitchen. No rugs at all, except a door mat in front of the entry, and a small rug under my desk. Pretty easy work I think. I do have 1\" thresholds between each room, the Shark goes over them like a tank. The thing is a beast. I noticed a difference right away. Before, I vacuumed every other day with my cordless Dyson, which works great, but it does take time. What I notice is a different feel on the hardwood floors. Theres a different feel on the floors after you\\'ve just mopped, versus after you\\'ve gone without mopping for a while, even with constant vacuuming (I\\'m talking about the Dyson). With this Shark, it feels like the floors have been mopped all the time. Now, don\\'t fool yourself, the don\\'t LOOK freshly mopped. I turned the Shark over, and there\\'s a little brush almost in the center underneath, that has to explain the firm sort of floor feel. It\\'s good, it\\'s less dust. If I have time, I could mop at almost any time, rather than all the previous prep work I had to do before. Remember, I have 6 cats. Rugs, not great. Hard floors, very good. I get the dyson out for tight places it can\\'t get into, every couple days, or areas I have marked off with the magnetic strips, and I go over those rugs.  You can get off brand replacement brush head and rotor thingys on amazon in a kit very inexpensively. Eighteen dollar range.  So far I do recommend this, but I wish they would put more effort into the app. I would be really frustrated if I hadn\\'t had the previous owners 9:30am daily vacuuming programmed in. It\\'s a fantastic time saver. Why 2 stars? It\\'s a bother.  By the way, The price on this fluctuates dramatically. When I first started watching this, it was something like $365.

I typically shut certain doors so on average it’s probably cleaning around 1,000sq feet. The battery lasts about an hour and a half and in that time it cleans everywhere I’d like it to very well. I haven’t found that hair gets tangled or anything gets clogged. It picks up debris well and is easy to empty and clean. it does great on tile and carpet. I run mine every day, sometimes twice and it’s definitely been a life saver. For $100 you really can’t beat it. Also, I’ve seen some reviews mentioning issue with the app but I’ve had none. I really only use it to check the “operation records” to see where it’s cleaned each time but the app works fine for me.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 11, 'reviewer': {'name': 'JH/AR'}}, {'title': 'a huge upgrade on my Roomba E5', 'body': 'Update Aug 31, 2024:  After quite some time with this item, I have noticed a few annoying issues that reduce it from 5 stars to 4 stars.  Two issues with the app: For some reason, you cannot log in on two phones at once. So if my wife tries to log in to turn it on, it logs me out, and vice versa. Second, for some reason the app frequently does not see the robot. Usually it will eventually pick it up but I\\'ve had to remove and rea-add it twice.  It also struggles a lot to find it\\'s home and usually just roams around until it dies. It does have a fairly small entrance to when it\\'s home is in the closet, but its still 2-3x the width of the robot. And if the robot is coming it at an imperfect angle and sees the wall, it will turn around and roam around for 5 more minutes before it tries again.  These three issues have made the robot has become much less convenient.  We have resorted mostly to just turning the robot on by pressing the button on it, to avoid the possibility of spending 5 minutes fumbling with our phones. This is made further annoying by the fact that you can only set it to \"random\" driving rather than \"Smart\" diving via the button. And then we have to often manually put it away as well.  I\\'d still pay the $90 I paid for this for the quieter fan, better obstacle navigation, and capability of smart driving, however I definitely would be mad if I paid full $200 price for this. ————————————————————————  Original Review:  In 2019 I bought a used 2018 Roomba E5 for $199 on Ebay which was definitely a game changer over not having anything.  However, it is large, loud, and not very smart. For example, it turns \"randomly\", rather than \"intelligently\" so tends to run over the same areas in the house meanwhile missing others. It also has \"cliff\" sensors which I had to remove so that it will go over my black carpet.  It worked well enough but I decided to check in January for any good deals on holiday returns for tech upgrades, including a better robot vacuum.  This thing had 7K reviews, 4.5+ stars, and had an open box item for over 60% off ($88 vs $209 new) so I said why the hell not.  And let me tell you, this thing is a huge upgrade.  It is about 40% smaller than my old E5, is much quieter, it has the \"smart\" driving so actually gets my whole house, it handles shag rugs far better, and is much capable of getting itself unstuck. It can modulate its wheel height and turn off it\\'s vacuum allowing to rock and free itself.  It still looks to be afraid of black carpets, however this is much less of a problem for me now that I only have 1 black rug instead of 4. I might remove it\\'s cliff sensors if it annoys me enough though.  Overall, buying it for $90 was a no brainer. I\\'d be willing to pay $200 for this.', 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': 14, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Matt'}}, {'title': 'Best customer service AND this thing works really well', 'body': 'The switch was turned off under the cover and the unit stopped working.

One of which was for a Ring doorbell, which I rated 5 stars. The other was glue that was no different than water, which got 1 star. This is worse than the glue which served no purpose, this did less than that.  Let me start by saying I had pretty low expectations for this vacuum to begin with. For $100, how good could it be? When we purchased an ecovac a few years ago around that price point, it did fairly well. Mostly, it was just there to help with dog hair cleanup, especially around the times the dog\\'s coat blew out. Took me about ten minutes to set it up, and then off it went running into things and at least trying to pick up what it could. That\\'s all I expected from this vacuum. To exist to somewhat cleanup a bit of dog hair so it didn\\'t get out of control. It only needed to do that, and be able to be scheduled at night to do its thing. What did this thing end up doing? No way to connect it to wifi, to do just that.  The first thing that worried me is that the documentation I got seemed to be for three different apps on your phone to connect it to wifi. The first, on the vacuum and in color was telling me to download the Lefant app. Went ahead and did that, took a bit to sign up because they only allow alphanumeric characters, and only up to 12 characters long for some reason, and also you need to get a code to actually make an account. Not sure why, but it is what it is. Now comes the fun part, you follow the prompts, and it starts to pair your device. First time, fails. Not a big deal, I\\'m about 20 feet from the router, maybe that is the problem. Bring it over next to the router. Failed again. Try a few more times by resetting the vacuum, thinking maybe it was a return, connecting to its own wifi that it was broadcasting, nothing. Always failed around 70%. Went to Google and first result was unsurprisingly their page. Tells me to do the same thing the app said, which was unhelpful. After a few reddit posts, and a couple of youtube videos, saw most people recommended using the \"Smart Life\" app. While that was a little strange, the SSID for the vacuum was \"SmartLife-MAC\" so I assumed maybe that was the newest one, and the documentation on the robot was wrong.  So I go digging through the other documentation, which shows the Smart Life app, and not the Lefant app. Follow those instructions, which most of the screens are different than what it\\'s showing in the directions. Using the two different methods, running into the same problem, but now I\\'m not even getting an error message to attempt to troubleshoot, simply a \"Device failed to connect\". The second method way seemed to be working, since I would go from the SmartLife-MAC SSID, back to my primary one. However, it still eventually failed.  Overall, it was about an hour of fighting with two different apps, three different versions of the instructions and a website that gave you the same information as the error messages on the Lefant app, and the only way to open a ticket is through the app which required all the information about my vacuum, and an undisclosed amount of time before they got back. As such, I am returning the product.  The main things it suggested to look at it was that your wifi was not 5Ghz, mine is not, I have a -5Ghz one and a 2.4 Ghz one for this very reason. Several devices in my house required a dedicated 2.4 network, so that wasn\\'t the problem.  The next thing, check to make sure it was in pairing mode, which is was since the app kept \"finding\" it as soon as I put it into pairing mode, so not an issue there.  Both phones I tried were android phones, all up to date, and Pixel devices. My device doesn\\'t have many apps on it, so I doubt it was my phone causing an issue. To be sure I forgot ALL other wifi spots I had in there, and only had my 2.4 one, just to make sure.  I can\\'t imagine a scenario where this robot would be useful at all - perhaps I got a lemon and there was something else wrong with it, but the combination of the poor app(s), terrible instructions, and no other way to control it, I\\'d recommend buying a broom with that $100, or just set it on fire if you really hate money that much.', 'rating': 1, 'helpfulVotes': 2, 'reviewer': {'name': 'james mix'}}, {'title': 'Just fair but better than no bot vacuum at all', 'body': 'This is my starter robot vacuum so didn\\'t expect bells and whistles.

My kids were so excited to add a robot to our house. They named him \"eightfivefour\" and wrote him a welcome letter. Perhaps this is why he worked so well in the beginning. Maybe if we had kept the love coming he would\\'ve continued along that trajectory. Instead, he started making up his own completely different trajectory, literally rolling around in a diagonal instead of straight lines. Which I didn\\'t think was a big deal until I noticed large areas left unvaccuumed and the trouble he had getting out of the hallway (where he got stuck on an endless loop). So, I deduct 1 star for the fact that performance deteriorated so quickly after purchase. When I attempted to find a reason for this error, no advice could be found in the user manual and their customer service is non-existent. Amazon was kind enough to help me with a return but, after I was done chatting with customer service and getting that return process started, I started to think about the kids. They would be so heartbroken to say goodbye to eightfivefour! My husband suggested we take it to the woods and tell them we\\'re letting him loose in the wild, lol. Then set it off on a trail and distract them while one of us retrieves it. That would make for an interesting childhood memory! But u stead, I took a closer look at the little bot to see if I could determine how to make it work better. There was nothing wrong with the wheels, but I could see a little scuff mark and very minor dust on the sensor. Could this really be the only thing preventing it drop rolling in straight lines? I wiped it with a damp cloth and started it up. Sure enough, it was going straight again! I dont know why, but it still isn\\'t picking up as well as it first did. I empty the debris chamber regularly, every time it runs in fact, rather than the once a week recommended in the manual. But maybe that too needs a more thorough cleaning, like the sensor.

What I like about this one is that it doesn\\'t have a brush roll. I have dogs and their fur used to jam up the brush roll on my previous vacuum. This model has brushes on the sides to flick the dirt and debris toward the \"mouth\". (I\\'m not sure what else to call it.) It gets clogged once in a while, but it\\'s simple to just pull put the lump of fur. Not complicated like unwinding hair (my daughters have really long hair and they shed like the dogs) from a brushroll.  THE CONS My last vacuum came with floor strips that you could place across doorways, tops of stairs, etc to keep the vacuum from entering. This was helpful so that I didn\\'t have to close all the bedroom doors to keep the vacuum out. (My kids leave clothes and charge cords and thing lay around in their rooms--things the vacuum would get hung-up on.) This one doesn\\'t have that feature. It has sensors so that it doesn\\'t run into things like furniture, but the sensors don\\'t notice things that aren\\'t at least a couple inches tall.  The run time is close to an hour. That\\'s plenty of time to clean my living room and kitchen, but if you have a larger space or more rooms the battery may not last.  The biggest con is that the app stopped connecting to the vacuum. I LOVED the remote feature. Especially so that I could keep an eye on battery level, but it hasn\\'t worked for a long time. I\\'ve had the vacuum about 18 months and for the last half of that, I\\'ve been patient, hoping app updates would correct this, but every so often I try to connect the app to the vacuum and it fails to pair.

The robot seems to vacuum good, bought it mainly to do daily cleaning due to dog hair. It does a great job vacuuming and picking up the dog hair. The mopping function could use some improvements. It doesn’t seem to mop all that well. It starts out good, leaving the full width of the mopping pad on the floor behind it. But after a few mins, it seems to just leave about a 1” wide streak on the floor. The other problem with it, is that the holder that holds the mopping pad attachment to the robot, after about a week and a half of use, fell off while it was cleaning. After inspecting it, found that the tab that hold it in place on the one side snapped off, causing the attachment to come off. Ordered a replacement part, and installed on the robot. After about a week or so again, it did the same thing and came off, due to a broken tab on the robot. Not sure what is causing this issue. Could be as it goes from floors to carpet, that it maybe getting caught and putting too much force on it, causing it to snap the tab off. Whatever it is, it seems the robot needs some improvements on the mopping function and mopping attachment.  Works great as a vacuum, and not so well mopping. Still decent for the price.

I wish I had gotten this earlier in my life.  I have 2 cats, and keeping up with the fur and stray litter is a banal challenge. With this thing, it's basically a non issue now.  The room mapping and app worked like a dream. It was stupidly easy to set up and use. You can tell it to clean whatever zone you want at any time, or set a schedule. You can even adjust the vacuum suction strength based on which room it's in. I suggest high suction for pet fur.  Battery life is good, it can do my entire apartment without recharging. But to test it I did push it past it's limit and it just goes home, recharges itself, then gets back to work when it's ready. If you have a large home with more than 2 bedrooms I could see it needing to take a break before completion.  It jumps right over anything up to almost an inch high. No issues with room transitions or thick rugs. The only thing it struggles with is really light small throw rugs which it will attempt to consume and then get stuck.  It has good suction strength and is fairly quiet. It's certainly not as loud as my regular vacuum cleaner, or even my hand vacuum. I was worried the cats would hate it, but they couldn't care less about it unless it touches them.  The capacity of the tank isn't huge, but it can do my apartment without needing to be emptied, now that the floors are staying more consistently clean, anyway. If you have a really large floorplan with more than 2 bedrooms or it encounters a big mess, I could see it needing to be emptied before completion. It's not really a problem, it only takes a second to empty it. And I generally run it while I'm home so I can clear and pick up toys and stuff off the floor before sending it off to do my bidding. That way it's not likely to run into a cat barf on a rug while I'm not home. I don't know what that would look like but I'm not keen to find out. Despite being pretty easy to clean, I just don't think that would be... optimal.  Even the filter, brush, and wheels are easy to clean. I actually really appreciate how easy it is to fully clean the primary brush. I'm used to having to get the scissors out to untangle long hairs from around the brush apparatus in my main vacuum but this one pops right out and back in. It's a great design.  I wish I had been aware in advance of the placement requirements, though. It wants its little home base to be placed on hardwood or tile, against a wall, with 1.5 feet of empty space to each side and 5 feet clearance in front. As it happens they're was almost nowhere in my home that met that criteria and was not in the way and also near an accessible electrical outlet. A little re-arrange later I placed it with somewhat less than what it asked for, but it works just fine. It's pretty good at getting itself home but I think it does really need about 3+ feet of room directly in front of it.  All in all, for the price this is a great purchase indeed.

This high level of suction ensures that your floors are left impeccably clean. I also have a eufy robot vacuum and this seems to be able to get everything that the eufy missed.  The vacuum does a commendable job of adjusting to different floor types, though it might need a little assistance when navigating over thicker carpets or cables.  The ROPVACNIC offers a respectable battery life, capable of running for approximately 100 minutes on a single charge. This should be sufficient for most cleaning sessions. The automatic self-charging feature is a significant plus, allowing the vacuum to return to its dock when the battery is low and resume cleaning after recharging. This ensures consistent performance without requiring frequent manual intervention.  One of the ROPVACNIC’s major strengths is its versatile control options. It can be operated via an intuitive mobile app, voice commands (compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant), or a remote control. The app allows for easy scheduling, custom cleaning modes, and real-time status updates. This range of control options adds a layer of convenience, making it easy to integrate the vacuum into your daily routine.  The scheduled cleaning feature works effectively, allowing you to set specific times for the vacuum to clean, which is ideal for maintaining a regular cleaning schedule.  The ROPVACNIC noise level is noticeable during operation, which might be a minor inconvenience if you have a quiet environment or need to run the vacuum while sleeping.  Overall:  The ROPVACNIC Robot Vacuum Cleaner impresses with its powerful 3000Pa suction, smart navigation, and versatile control options. It is particularly effective on hard floors and low-pile carpets and handles pet hair with ease. The combination of automatic self-charging, scheduled cleaning, and multiple control methods makes it a highly convenient option for modern households. While it has a few minor drawbacks, such as occasional obstacle navigation issues and a slightly higher noise level, its strengths make it a solid choice for anyone seeking a reliable and powerful robot vacuum.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 4, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Vivian W'}}, {'title': \"My expectations were low, but I'm pleased\", 'body': \"This is the first robot vacuum I have purchased.

I sometimes have trouble with it not completing a cleaning cycle, but I close some doors and/or force it to a new area by blocking it from the area it has already cleaned. It does get stuck on stuff, but just have to move it off/away from the offending item and on it goes. Actually seems to get stuck less than my previous brand. The suction on this machine is powerful and it runs in a very logical pattern once it gets going. We have 2 short haired dogs and live in the country on small acreage, so lots of dirt on a constant basis. The machine does a good job of letting you know when it has run into an issue, like getting stuck (Bumper Failure) or when the brushes need cleaning (we already had to clean them for the dog hair it has picked up that my Sebo vacuum didn't!). One issue I've had is that it returns to the base to charge (seemingly before the battery is depleted) and empty, but I haven't gotten it to go back out and finish the house on its on. I haven't bothered to set up a scheduled cleaning because I feel like I have to be here to supervise it, but that is a minimal issue for me, as I am retired. It does need about 4 feet clear in front of the charging station as it finds the station, then backs away from it to turn around and line up properly for charging and emptying. Emptying is a bit loud, but I'd take that over having to manually empty it! I'm giving it a 4 because the suction on this machine is amazing, and because it vacuums in a logical pattern once it gets going, but not a 5 because of the supervision and redirection it sometimes requires.  The support team is in China, so it takes quite a while to hear back from them, given the time difference, but they do respond.  Original Review: Got it all set up and charged and set it to clean. Failure after failure within 15 seconds of setting it to clean. Brand new and never worked. Goes in circles and erratic patterns for 10 to 15 seconds, then fails. Junk!

We live in a small farm and I sweep my floors multiple times a day. I had some robots previously but they didn’t last as they clogged, and the self empty seemed like a good fix. This is easy to set up and get going and the app is good. We charged it up and sent it about and it cleaned for 45 minutes in linear rows and then alternated to diagonal rows, I assume “mapping” but no clue as long as it’s cleaning. It did great picking up dog hair and dirt. It found a couple of pebbles it did not like at all and got stuck in a transition twice. Otherwise we were happy. I liked the ability to set a cleaning schedule very much. Then we sent it back to empty and nothing. I thought maybe it had to recharge before it could empty so we let it sit overnight and tried the self empty again and nothing. I check all the ducts and the little flap door, all clear and nothing stuck. I called and they asked me to turn it off and on in true IT fashion - didn’t fix anything. So now I am returning this sadly because I was happy with all the features but it’s useless if it can’t self empty. I had high hopes but it fell flat - so I guess you do get what you pay for and I’m going to have to shell out twice as much for one that actually works.

I waited a long time before buying and asked a lot of questions of my friends and read a lot of robot vacuum reviews. At the outset, it is an amazing value for the price. The price was a huge draw for me. In the week that we've had it, it has been charging or running just about the whole time, and we have emptied the dustbin again and again. We have sinus allergies in our house, so my heart has rejoiced as we dump out each cup of dust. And we weren't slobs to begin with! I am amazed to say that I'm already noticing an improvement in the air quality in our house; it's like the difference between cleaning your house yourself and getting a professional deep clean. This vacuum works equally well on hard floors and carpeting. It's also surprisingly quiet. It picks up dust, dirt, and particles as big as a piece of popcorn. It also picked up hair and wound it around the side brushes; it was very easy to remove. It zips under beds and furniture with ease. I was also impressed with the way that the brushes took in all of the dirt along edges and corners. Did I mention that my whole family is super happy with it? I feel that this is more than worth the price, and I love it. There are features that we could have paid more for, which this doesn't have, but these didn't matter to us. In the interest of full disclosure, I'll explain. First, this machine vacuums only, and doesn't mop. Second, the dustbin is on the small side, and the battery life isn't super-long. It takes about 4 hours to fully charge, and it runs for an hour to an hour and a half when it's fully charged. On our first few runs, it stopped before that point because the dustbin was full of dust. It doesn't do stairs, but it does stop as promised at the top of the stairs. I have one area rug which stands a bit more than an inch above the hardwood floor, and the vacuum has no problems ascending, but it kind of hangs up on the edge of the rug rather than make the descent. Also, it doesn't have a dock that beckons it back, so it stops when the battery is done or when the cup is full. It runs in a random pattern, and it doesn't have frills like voice commands or scheduling. None of these things have been a deal-breaker for us, and we're very happy with it.

I went a little deeper and busted out my trusty voltmeter and measured the voltage at the power adapter and it was a solid 13V. Good.  I measured the voltage of the battery and it was 0.03V. Bad. It should be around 11.1V after charging the whole night. I then checked the voltage at the 4 pin battery header on the unit side with the power adapter plugged in and it was showing around 0V between the red and black wires, 1.5V between the outer yellow and black wires and 0V between the inner yellow and black wires.  With the battery and power adapter plugged in, I measured about 0.03V between the red and black wires.  I’m thinking that on the defective units, the unit is not charging the batteries.

I've changed my position for two reasons:  - It was explained to me that the real time map is to allow the user to see what has and has not been cleaned in the house. To actively map the house and save results will require additional hardware not available on the M210 Pro. Reasonable.  - A recent SW update has enhanced the vacuum performance improving it's ability to find the charging station and providing uniform cleaning coverage.  In my re-assessment, the M210P is a great value and a good 'entry level' cleaner for my needs.  This product is so close to 'good'. Works (almost) perfectly for what I need - hard floors, addresses lots of pet hair, long battery life. But the core problem is the navigation and mapping. The vacuum 'maps' the house as it cleans but doesn't save the map and doesn't learn. The robot doesn't 'remember' the house layout, it doesn't 'remember' where the charging station is, it doesn't 'remember' exclusion zones. Every time you initiate the cleaning, it starts from scratch, doesn't know what has and has not been cleaned, and to watch it try to stumble and fumble in trying to find the charging station is almost sad.

The vacuum’s performance on various floor types is commendable, picking up dirt and debris efficiently.  However, there are a few minor issues.

At first, we were thrilled. It picked up better than the other vacuum and what’s not to love about the bin automatically emptying the vacuum? Now we’ve owned this thing for about 7 months and I believe it to be a waste of a few hundred bucks. It has stopped auto emptying. I’ve done all the trouble shooting I can find online. So now we have to hit to button to get it to empty, but only when the button is available on the app, which isn’t all the time. There’s a whole other fix for each time that happens, if you feel like spending 10-15 minutes doing it, which in my opinion I’d rather spend vacuuming my own floors. Sometimes it will randomly work and empty itself as well. We also constantly get errors that the roomba is stuck and when we go looking for it, we find it in the middle of the floor, not obstructed by anything, just stopped. It seems to error when finding home and just die quite a bit too. Overall, after seeing how great it did for only a short period of time, I would not spend the money on this brand name again. I’ve tried to submit a ticket for this on the app a couple of times only to have it error before submitting after I spend time typing all of this up. What a waste of $300. Save your money. This isn’t any better than the many other brands that are out there, but it definitely costs more. In fact, I talked a friend into buying a roomba during the first few blissful months when we loved it. I followed up with her recently and it turns out they returned it in less than a week because they too were getting constant errors, so this doesn’t appear to be unique. The whole idea is that it takes care of a chore so you don’t have to. But be prepared because you have a new chore now. Vacuum mechanic and locator.  I have been in touch with customer care. They sent me a new clean base and the problem was solved, or so it seemed. Then the vacuum began getting itself lost and not returning home and giving location errors again. I reached back out to customer service and they opted to replace the actual vacuum. While I was waiting for that vacuum, the clean base stopped emptying again, which was the problem I originally complained of. I figured I’d wait to complain until I could see if the new vacuum fixed it. Well, the new vacuum came with its own set of errors. Now it’s telling me the clean base is clogged (it’s brand new and I have checked it for a clog and there is none). It also gave me an error that the bag was full but it’s a brand new bag and not full. I’m over this vacuum. The only good thing about it is that they’re trying to solve my problem however a new problem continues to pop up each time. And since the clean base is new and a separate vacuum was also sent to me brand new, this appears to just be a bad product.im frustrated because at this point, I’d like to mail the vacuum back for a refund but am told that I only had 30 days to do that so basically I’m stuck.  Update. In 4 months we will have had this $400 piece of junk for 2 years, so it’s been just over a year and a half. The bin has NEVER emptied consistently and often doesn’t even alert us that it needs to be emptied so we think it’s working fine until we can’t get it to work one day and find the bin jam packed. We still consistently get random errors. We are unable to use “vacuum everywhere” because when we do, it just hops off the base, vacuums for 5 minutes and claims to have completed the job successfully. Now, it has stopped operating completely. We open the app and it says it needs to be rebooted but then the reboot doesn’t help. As soon as it comes back online it claims to need to be rebooted again.

But I got one for Christmas and liked it so much I bought 2 more. I have all hard flooring, no carpets, and 2 dogs, a cat, and two birds that all contribute to mess. So I had to sweep everyday or I'd get those pet-hair tubleweeds blowing around. Having to sweep all the time I get lazy and let it go; or when I do it I spend an hour or 2 sweeping or vacuuming. These robots save me hours of time and get the job done better because they are relentless. I set them on a schedule and they do it everyday completely. I have one robot that I manually have to empty the cup everyday. He's in the bedroom, since I'm in that room every day that's convenient enough and only takes 2 minutes. I bought an i3+ and an i4+, they self empty and I have to change the bag about once every 2-4 months. I don't mind the cost of the vacuum bags because they give me so many hours of my time back.  The first one I got is the little guy. The little guy's name is Finigan. Finigan isn't too smart. He vacuums in a random pattern. I started with him in the main part of the house. He did a great job but his battery usually ran out before he considered himself done. So the space is a bit more then he likes. He did a great job though. But I loved it so much I got more to cover the whole house and moved him to the smaller bedroom area. In the bedroom suite (bedroom + bathroom~350sq ft), he spends about 45 minutes zipping around to cover everything. When his battery is low he docks himself. I have to empty his cup everyday. At first his cup was usually about 3/4 full to full. The first day it filled and he stopped. I had to empty it and re-start him. After a few months of daily vacuuming, the cup is about 1/4 full each day. So I switched him to a MWF schedule. He's still about 1/4 to 1/2 full each use. He even goes under the bed and keeps that clean. It's really great.  The i3+ is Dixie. Dixie does the downstairs. Dixie is smart. She goes in straight line patterns and covers the entire space using a very planned straight line methodical routine. The first day she poked around learning. It was about 1.5 hours. After that, the entire job was planned out and she did the whole thing in about 45 minutes. She has no problem when certain doors are opened vs closed. When it's open, she goes in and vacuums. If it's closed, she skips it. Her cleaning time varies from about 45 minutes to 1hr 15minutes depending on whether the extra rooms are included (doors open vs closed). She drives back to her base when done and docks. And the base sucks out what she collected. I love the base, it means I do not have to tend to her everyday. I actually only need to change the bag about every 3-4 months. There's not a lot going on downstairs. The litter box is there and so the cat pays visits. But we aren't down there daily tracking things around. Thanks to Dixie, there's no fur balls, hair-tumbleweeds, dust, or dirt. Always a nice clean floor. It's awesome. Her map in the app shows where she found 'extra' dirt. Usually right in front of the litter box. It's so awesome not having to sweep up litter daily. I have her on a MWF schedule too and that is more than enough to keep the place clean.  I recently got Nick, an i4+ for the upstairs. He's quieter. He's like Dixie in is planning and map reporting, so he's smart. It's very cool. He also gets the job done quickly. First day was like 1.5 hours learning. Now he's done in 50 minutes. The base sucks everything out so I don't have to tend to him as much as Finigan. He's in the main part of the house and it gets the most dirty. The dogs spend all there time here. The cat is up here most of the time. And we have two birds who send seeds everywhere. It's amazing how far from the cage those birds can flick seeds. And their feathers and drift everywhere too. Nick takes care of all that. I do need to manually get under the couch and behind and under furniture which I do once every month or so. But this robot is awesome. Saves me the day in and day out sweeping and vacuuming.  Having robots spend 3+ robot labor hours each day vacuuming is an awesome human labor saver. Once they've hit the whole house for a month or two I'm able to step them back to MWF schedules. Their brushes do a great job in the corners, better than me sweeping or vacuuming; mostly because they hit those corners every day and spend the time swirling that brush to work on it. That constant day in day out effort pays off over time. I really can't imagine going back to manually doing this. I look back at the hours I spent doing it thinking that was Neanderthal days. I look forward to telling my grand kids how I used to walk to school uphill in the snow everyday, dial rotary phones, select music off of CD's I had to manually put into a machine, and now, that I spent hours sweeping the floors in the good old days.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 823, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Robert Jordan'}}, {'title': 'Works great!', 'body': \"I purchased my first Roomba and picked the Combo i5+ model.

Mine couldn’t have been easier, setup was a breeze. Also people complaining of noise? I actually couldn’t believe how quiet our i3 Roomba is. My son was watching tv while it vacuumed in the same room. Yes the emptying process into the bin is about as loud as a normal upright vacuum but that only last a few seconds. So far it returns right to its base for emptying and charging once finished. It got stuck only once under a low cabinet hutch, but that was really my fault as you do have to kinda “ROOMBA PROOF” your home if you expect it to work independently. It has great suction. We have three cats and it picked up the litter great. Hardly anything left. Now mind you, you do have to do a deep upright vacuum clean every so often. I mean I think people have way too High expectations if they think they will never vacuum again. Yes it’s strong and yes it does a fantastic job of maintaining the place till I can deep clean again but it’s not a replacement for that. It’s simply for me a day to day maintenance which means I don’t have to vacuum every day and when I do use my upright there’s much less to do. That’s very useful to me. I only had one weird run where it vacuumed only the kitchen(where home base is)and than after 6 minutes returned home and said job was “complete” Not sure if it got confused because it does literally have to map every time it goes out. Unlike the more expensive models that save the mapping info. However this does navigate quite well. I actually watched it for a couple runs and once it bumps and learns where the couch is or the table for example, it turns automatically and stops before it hits when it passes these obstacles again. I think for a very complex layout with many obstacles it does unbelievable. So cool to see it make its way all the way into our bedroom but than know how to travel all the way back to its base. I also saw it once impressively go between a stool there was barely enough room, vacuum under it and than make a 180 and left the way it came in without one bump. So yes once it learns and maps great and it does do as straight of lines possible which is nice and very efficient. The times you do see it doubling back or going out of the straight path is usually when it detects extra dirt which it than will circle back for. It also will tell you when it’s stuck and I love that I can set it to vacuum when I’m out. It’s a breeze to clean the brushes and everything is replaceable which I love.

It really is like training a new pet - lots of work at first, and then you\\'ll still have accidents and ongoing training forever. Plus there are some bugs in the system to be worked on iRobot\\'s side. I\\'ll summarize our findings:  -Make sure to give him wide open clearance space in front. We started with him in a 4\\' wide hallway that our Eufy had no problem with, but Robert couldn\\'t find his way around. - For some reason, Robert won\\'t save a map after he runs. This means that if you start a new job, it\\'s like he\\'s learning your house from scratch again. If you want him to be smart, you have to set him out on a \"Smart Map\" run, which is just like a normal run except with no suctioning. There, he\\'ll go around your house like a blind idiot bumping into things and eventually come out with a cool map that you can divide up into rooms and he\\'ll follow from then on. But why this requires a separate run and can\\'t be saved after a regular run I don\\'t know. - Speaking of the Smart Map run, this may take you 3-4 (or 8) times before you get it. Because he wanders around like a more basic, unintelligent robovac during the smart run, it means he misses a lot, gets stuck a lot, and generally causes you frustration. Each smart run will return a map of what he covered, and if you\\'re like us, he\\'ll often miss entire rooms or sections of the house. We had to run it several times before he came back with an adequate coverage map. And I say adequate because it only loosely resembles our actual floor plan, but it\\'s close enough. Oh, and make sure to pick up everything off your floor - slippers and cat toys will screw him up. - Once you get a map you\\'re happy with though, the app is pretty neat in how it lets you draw rooms. He\\'ll suggest rooms for you too, but those didn\\'t make any sense. It\\'s a little quirky drawing lines in the app to section off your house (e.g. sometimes lines go all the way across your house, sometimes they\\'ll stop at a room), but the experience is cool and rewarding. - Once you have your smart map drawn, then the cool part happens: you can create a bunch of different schedules to vacuum different parts of your house. For example, our entryway gets vacuumed every day because of foot traffic, but the bedrooms only need 3 times a week. This feature alone is a HUGE benefit and way cooler than our previous Eufy 11s Robovac. Almost worth the cost of the device itself. - Once you have your map, the vacuum experience is pretty good. He\\'ll follow your map but still bump into a lot of stuff (I assume the \"edges\" of the objects he mapped are pretty fuzzy). It is cool to see him go down a straight line, bump into the wall, and turn around down another straight line. Gives you a feeling of pride that you trained him well. The suction power is good too - picks up all the litter my 4 cats leave scattered around - better than the Eufy. And it\\'s neat to watch him stop in the middle of job, go to the bathroom (or go for a battery charge) and then come right back where he left off. - Keep in mind this is all relative. He still moves like a half-blind old dog. Bumps into things. Stops and stands still for 30 seconds at a time like he\\'s lost. Spins around in circles going nowhere. He gets stuck on weird things - will chirp at me that he\\'s stuck on a cliff when he can\\'t find his way off of a thick rug. Bumps into or rolls over everything you left on the floor. But like an old dog, he mostly knows his way around and can make it back to his bed and take a dump by himself. - Speaking of... you\\'ve heard other reviewers say he\\'s pretty loud when he goes to the toilet. But you don\\'t understand. When I say loud, I mean LOUD. Like a jet engine in your house going off for 20 seconds. And sometimes one flush isn\\'t enough. I\\'ll regularly hear 3 jet engines taking off in a row. During his normal vacuum run he\\'s not exactly quiet either - much louder than my Eufy and too loud to hold a conversation near. Like a normal upright vacuum. - The app is really nice to use. Friendly, designed well, drawing maps and scheduling jobs is easy. Get lots of notifications on Robert\\'s status (successful job, stuck, problems with the toilet, etc) which is neat. Robert likes to talk. Probably the highlight of the product. I also really like that you can specify if you want him to cover a room twice instead of once, for when you\\'re extra dirty.  All that said, there are still bugs: - Since day 1, Robert tells me that the dust bag is full nearly every day. Which is a lie. Robert is a liar. Not only is that impossible after one day, but it forces me to go check the bag and I can visually see it\\'s still mostly empty. Usually this just means taking the bag out and putting it right back in, which thankfully is easy, but required because he won\\'t clear that error until you do. - I\\'ve also gotten a few complaints that the pipes are clogged. I know Robert takes big dumps, but this is a lie too. Unclogging involves getting out a screw driver and taking the base apart. Three times I\\'ve done this and each time there was absolutely nothing in the pipes. I don\\'t know what that\\'s about.  Overall: I think this is a very nice upgrade over the Eufy 11s. We genuinely feel like we don\\'t need to vacuum as much, which we didn\\'t always feel with the Eufy. Works greats on litter and cat hair on bare floors - carpets are iffy. Robert can be a pain sometimes but at least he makes the experience fun, just like an old pet.  The promise of a hands-off experience though doesn\\'t get met - I have to help Robert along almost daily. DEFINITELY not worth $500-600, but if you can get it on a black Friday-like sale, then go for it.', 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': 684, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Amazon Customer'}}, {'title': \"He's Smart But Fussy\", 'body': 'I purchased this guy based on the good reviews for my upstairs. Upstairs is all carpeted and we have two dogs and three cats. I named him Scooty Patooty, but I should have named him Felix Unger because he cleans well, but he\\'s super fussy!  Here\\'s the good: His main job is to vacuum the office, hallway and master bedroom. The suction on the vacuum is impressive. He leaves the \"lines\" so you know where he\\'s been. Scooty makes several stops to empty his bin, which lets you know that he truly is getting a lot of hair and debris. He does a good job vacuuming and keeping the carpet clean in between regular vacuuming.  Here\\'s the not-so-good: He\\'s very sensitive. More often than not, I will get an alert that there is a problem with Scooty. The #1 alert that I receive is that that he can\\'t empty his dust bin because \"the Dirt Disposal Bag is full\".  Which leads me to my main complaint about the iRobot Roomba... the Dirt Disposal Bags. A blessing and a curse are the Dirt Disposal Bags. While Scooty can do a full job because he empties his bin into the DDBs, the DDBs are FAR from full when you get the alert. The DDBs are mostly filled with air, to be honest. So when I get the alert, I check the bag and \"squish\" the air out of it and put it back in for another run. The DDBs are expensive and do not hold much dirt. Those suckers should be chock full of hair and debris to warrant a bag change.  I have a very old Shark robot (\"Sharknado\") for my downstairs, and he is a champ. He is old school so he\\'s not connected to any app - he just \"beeps\" when he\\'s in trouble - which is rare. He deals with some area rugs and he\\'s not stellar at the rugs, but he\\'s great on the floors. He runs and runs and does his job and goes back to his dock.

Boy am I glad I did!! This little guy is TERRIFIC!!  It has the option to set it up with wifi and bluetooth so you can use the app and it can map your house. But you can also say, ‘that’s too much for me’ and just let it run free to clean as it pleases! Which is what I needed because I’m technically challenged lol. This dude is simple and does a great job! It cleverly lifts/angles itself to get out of tricky spots my old roomba would get stuck, and if there is a spot it will get stuck it comes with strips to place so it knows to stay away. It picks up dirt like a pro. The mop is the equivalent of a swiffer wet mop….so basically a damp dusting of the floor, but it does a great job. Don’t panic if at first it looks like it’s only ‘mopping’ strips. It took about 3 swipes before the mop pad got fully wet and then it was perfect! I also like that the remote allows you to appt clean or just do the edges of the room. (Seems pet fur always tends to hang out along the edges!) It finds its way back home to charge like a pro too! It doesn't bang into objects loudly. The sensor really works great. The 3 different suction settings are handy. The lowest seems to work just fine and is the quietest.

The 2nd one of the 3 didn't include a remote control + it's app needs too much personal info to use it. The 1st robot wasn't doing as it should at all + was acting stupid + crazy. Also, when I went onto it's app to register it, it kept saying I was purchasing a completely different model + I couldn't get help in changing that thru their Customer Service dept. They wanted a screenshot or video, which makes no sense, plus I'm too technically stupid to do that, besides, It was as if they were answering the wrong question.  THEN, I purchased this wonder robot. (I named her Pearl because of her beautiful white color) I bought a lovely decal for Pearl that matches her beautiful, blue lights.😎 I'm in my 60's + getting somewhat rickety so actually need her help. She does what one would expect plus much more. My husband helped me set her up this am after charging her overnight. For one thing, she works FINE by simply using the REMOTE ALONE, not needing to use it's app at all. She's fully functional without it, including the 3 mopping modes + 3 power levels. Today she's vacuumed our entire LR + hallway, + after a short recharge + break for us, she went onto completely vacuuming + mopping our kitchen AND bathroom with no problems. After my 1st 2 loser robots, Pearl's perfect in everyway. I ordered her accessories package before even unboxing her. I had some weird vibes she'd finally be the right robot for me. She even talks + gives me directions. Even our 110 lb dog approves. He playfully pounced at her 1x then ignored her. Pearl is perfection at a gr8 price with easy to understand instructions. She's sold me over + I'm both pleased + relieved I finally bought her. Also, she has a lg water tank + dust bin. For mopping, I found if I saturate her blue, mopping cloth on the mopping attachment she mops better. Like a slightly more wet version of a Swiffer Wet Jet mop. ( that was using the 3rd + highest mopping mode available, letting out the largest amt of water.) AND, OH, their customer service is wonderful. I'm so glad I bought her.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 78, 'reviewer': {'name': 'martigras'}}, {'title': 'It’s okay! you get what you pay for', 'body': 'The media could not be loaded. Okay so I have had this product for a few weeks now, and feel ready to judge it.  Pros: 1. it mops and sweeps at the same time. Since I hate mopping with the burning fire of a thousand suns, I would pay someone to do it for me if I could justify it. So this gets me out of mopping our whole first floor and the hallway upstairs if I’m feeling frisky and want to force this robot to clean twice in one day. 2. It actually does an okay job sweeping and vacuuming the low pile carpets I have around the house, when I’m not using the mop feature. The filter and catcher does a good job of getting things into it, so for daily light vacuuming and kids crumbs, this works pretty well. 3. It’s easy to start it from your phone, and to set up a schedule so that it will run on its own.  Cons 1. It requires supervision. If you have chairs with metal frames on the ground, this thing will get caught on them. If you have shag carpet, this will get caught on it. You have to set up obstacles to prevent it from hitting the high carpets and put all the chairs up. That’s a lot of work when you have an open floor plan and kids in and out of the house all day. Which brings me to my next point 2. The map feature is functionally useless. You can see sort of where it’s been (but it often feels like it’s in a brand new zone of the house it’s never seen before even if it literally just was there!), but you can’t tell it where to not go or where to avoid. I wish I could set up areas for it to skip so that when I have the mop function going, it’s not mopping my low pile carpets. That’s just weird. 3. The mopping feature is okay but not always the best (still better than me not doing it for two weeks straight). Sometimes you have to make it run over areas over and over to get it to actually clean the floor, because it does one pass and calls it good, but the mop pad isn’t always wet and so it’s not actually cleaning said area. You can adjust this a little by playing around with the water control, but I’ve yet to make it perfectly clean the floor in all areas. 4. The strip they give you is nowhere near enough to stop the thing from going to places you want it to avoid, so you spend a lot of time watching it. It’s like having my kids do chores- while they’re “doing” them, it’s actually me telling them exactly what to do with step by step directions and sometimes it feels like it would be easier for me to do it myself. I’ve avoided buying another strip of what seems like a heavy magnet strip by just putting pillows and chairs to block areas. It works, even if it’s a little weird to be throwing things on my shag carpet just because I don’t want the mop to go there.  Overall, for $120, it works once you figure out what you need to do (moving carpets in kitchen so it really goes over the floor, putting chairs up, setting obstacles so it avoids getting trapped in a spot). I have gotten doing those things down to a science and in under 10 minutes, I can start the robot.  I use it daily because again, I don’t cook and I don’t clean but lemme tell you how I got this 💍 and this thing makes me go WAP', 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': 36, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Molly'}}, {'title': 'Amazing robot vacuum and mop combo', 'body': \"The media could not be loaded. I have had my robot friend, Tikom, for a month. First impressions upon opening the box was an “Oooo Aahhh”. The directions said to let your new robot friend charge before first use, but of course, I ran him around immediately to just see how he works! He worked for about ten minutes. I couldn’t figure out how to get him to his home (charging station), but it turns out, he can find his own way home just fine. I recommend that you do take a few minutes to read the directions and familiarize yourself with the remote(if you want, you also can use App, it has more function) It took about 4 hours or so for Tikom to fully charge, then I turned him loose. Let me just say, I thought my floors were clean, or, at least, pretty clean. As it turns out, they were not. They were not clean at all. Tikom has picked up so much fur, dirt, dust, it’s unbelievable. My floors have literally never looked better! They are CLEAN. For real clean. I’ve always had a hard time cleaning under the bed, but now I don’t have to worry about it at all, because my robot friend takes care of it.  I have all hardwood floors and tile. I also have a few throw rugs, some thick, some thin. Tikom does a perfect job on the floors, and has no problems navigating over the throw rugs (though he might turn up a corner, but he will run back over it and still get it clean). I don’t think your robot friend would work very well if you have a lot of or mostly carpet. If you have hardwood or mostly hardwood, you will love your new robot friend.  Tikom mostly gets from room to room okay – the “up” entry points he cannot do on his own. For example, he cannot get over the threshold into my kitchen, but he can get down the threshold. He also cannot get over the threshold to get in the bathrooms. This is actually fine for me, because I prefer to control when he goes into the kitchen anyway so that I can shake off the rugs and/or pick up the cat food and water bowls and any shoes or other things that might be on the floor. I just put a bar stool in his way to keep him from exiting the kitchen when it’s time for him to clean in the kitchen.  Tikom will clean for about 2 hours. He does not have a “plan” so to speak, not like a person would say go from corner to the center of the room, but he is still very thorough, and obviously, his plan is way better than mine since my floors are so much cleaner than they ever were when I was in charge. My advice is to just trust the process and let your robot friend find his way around on his own! Just make sure that you pick up any cords, especially small cords like phone charging cords, and shoe laces or the like, so that he doesn’t accidentally grab onto something he shouldn’t. Tikom also has sensors so that when he comes to a piece of furniture or a wall, he will slow down so as to gently bump it before he turns off into a new direction. I have also noticed that if he comes into contact with a chair or table leg, he will often go in a circle all the way around the leg to clean around it.  Once your robot friend is done doing your dirty work for you, he will go back home on his own. If your robot friend cannot find his way home, you may not have provided him enough space. Is that any way to treat your new best friend?? Make sure that he has several feet of clear space in front of his charging station, and that there are a few feet of clear space on the sides of the charging station as well. Also, make sure to empty out his dust bin after every use.  The mopping function is great, better than using a Swifter type of mop but not as good as hand mopping, however I love that I don't have to do the mopping and allowing it time to do several passes seems to get the job done seamlessly.

I had been using a robot sweeper and a robot mopping unit which were made by another manufacturer. When I saw this all-in-one unit on sale, I decided to give it a try simply for the convenience of having one unit to activate.  Yes, it has definitely more convenient, but the other things it delivered were totally unexpected! It, by far, covers a larger area in much less time and, surprisingly, it's much quieter and does a better job. I actually am still in disbelief.

Important things to know about robot vacuums and mops:  * They are not going to get into cracks and crevices. Some people may want to deep clean occasionally. * Because they have a low profile, they get under chairs and other furniture with legs which means you don't have to stoop down or move furniture. *The sweeper cannot handle foreign objects so a quick look around before starting it is a good idea. * The mop feature uses water only. This concerned me at first but, in truth, my floors feel and look cleaner than when I used chemicals. After I ran the mopper a few times, I realized that my floors must have had a residue left from my other cleaners. The mopper cleaned up that residue, and the floors have a sheen again. In my opinion, a benefit to using water only is the floors, with no chemicals, are safer for pets, kids and everyone in the home.  I actually could go on and on about this. It has changed my life.

It's better to use it when you're around because sometimes it gets stuck in weird places which is sometimes very annoying (we have some pretty thick wood thresholds between rooms, though). You need to close doors to rooms you don't want it in and worry about drops/stairs. They do give you a sticky strip that you can put down that tells the vacuum not to pass (for tops of stairs, etc.).  It does a good job on hard floors, not great on carpet (even my really low pile area rugs). It won't replace having to vacuum yourself because sometimes it misses spots, but it's a nice touch up for in between. It's surprising how much it picks up even if you clean everyday. I don't use the mop function often, it's ok but I'd rather just mop myself, will skip that function next time.  The dust collector is small, so you'll need to empty it everytime. The rollers pick up a ton of hair you'll need to remove sometimes, but they did a good job making it very easy to take apart and clean which if you keep up with should help it last way longer.

If you have wires on the floor you\\'ll need to get them out of the way as it did find one of my charging cables and ended up getting caught and shutting off. Small cat mats that are very light should be removed as well.  I did have an episode where it didn\\'t seem to want to go \"home\" to the charging station so I had to pick it up and put it in front of the station. However, my girlfriend ran the machine when I wasn\\'t there and apparently called it home and it worked fine.  It\\'s fairly quiet for a vacuum which is a plus. Easy to clean We haven\\'t used the app nor have we used (and aren\\'t planning to) the mopping capability.  I\\'ve noticed a huge difference as there is a lot less litter so 5 stars from me.

I bought the A1 vac-only model last year thinking I didn\\'t really didn\\'t want or need the mop feature. Wrong! Love the wet-mop-vac!!! And still very glad it has strong suction rather than a roller-brush which does nothing but get tangled up with hair/dirt/fluff and it still runs quiet even with the suction increase from 3000Pa to 4000P!! Clipped on the brushes, plugged it into the docking station, charged it overnight, and it was ready to run the next morning. Was a little worried about using the wet-mop but clipping on the mop-pad and adding the water was super easy. Be aware the dust box and the water tank are part of the same pullout but each is clearly marked.  With the old A1 model I had to prepare and clear the floor which was a hassle but I ran the new S1 map/vac without moving or picking up anything. The mop/vac did not get tangled in electrical cords, did not repeatedly bounce around shoes or bags, and did not get hung up on the track of my slider door. I especially liked the more consistent pathways, no missed areas, and that it returned to the charge base with no problems.  The remote has the usual spot, edge, and auto buttons but has a couple of new buttons. The \"rain cloud\" button adjusts the water for the mop and the amount of water it used to wipe my floors seemed fine. I pushed the rain cloud button to see what changed. I wanted to reduce the amount of water for my living room and bedroom floors and increase the water for my kitchen and bathroom floors. I did manage to get before-after-mop photos of a dirt spot on my kitchen floor. Happy to say the mop feature did it\\'s job!!!  The second new \"little fan/big fan\" button adjusts the suction power. I pushed the button to increase the suction power for my bath rugs and vac did a great job! The only problem is that I had to turn off the water and snap off the mop-pad so that only the vac was used on my bath rugs. Will have to see if there is a better plan with the bath rugs so I don\\'t have to put-on-take-off-put-on the mop pad.  I didn\\'t set up the wifi App because I have an older Samsung android phone but then I didn\\'t set up the App on the A1 vac either and the remote worked fine for me.

The mop part works like a Swiffer right after vacuuming--was initially skeptical, but it actually does a decent job, especially when using warmer water. The vacuum is much better than the older ropvanic model I was using (only vacuum)--I had even accidentally dropped a decent amount of cat litter on the ground before the test, and it cleaned it up really well. The mop left some streaks at first, but since I hadn’t vacuumed or mopped in over a week, that was to be expected. After several passes, the streaks mostly went away, and I plan to go over it with my steamer mop.  The water tank and dry vacuum tank are conveniently housed in the same unit and are easy to extract. Cleaning the water tank is a bit challenging since it can’t be fully taken apart, but its doable. It’s best to let it air out occasionally. I did encounter a minor issue where a hair tie got stuck in a tire, but the vacuum alerted me to the problem and even identified the specific wheel, which was a nice surprise. And it was easy to remove from the wheel too  I will say this vacuum isn’t suitable for \"set it and forget it\" use if you have carpet. I think you’d need to remove the mop attachment and change the settings on the app to prevent water from getting on your carpet. The battery life is also pretty okay--It might struggle in a larger space like a two-bedroom apartment, it’s perfect for my small studio.

It seems to have a pretty well-designed brush and roller system so that even if it did get caught up with animal hair or string or something, it hasn't included tool for cutting that stuff out, and the beater bar is easily accessible and removable. Also, the robot has very specific error messages that are very accurate, so it will say that it's thinks something is caught up in a brush, or that it can't move because of wheel is off the ground, or some sensor is dirty. It's not at all like those messages that seem to be everywhere now in technology that just announce that something went wrong, with no further information.  However, if you're looking at this for its mopping function, know these things ahead of time. One, the mop function is no more sophisticated than the robot dragging what is essentially a wet washcloth behind it while it goes over a given surface. And that you must manually add and remove the mop cartridge for the given area you want to mop. That is, it cannot turn mopping on and off, and in fact is not aware at all that it even has the mop attached. The mop cartridge itself is a water tank that has something like a washcloth velcroed to the bottom. It dribbles water from the tank onto the washcloth, but in reality, this washcloth is barely damp in the locations where the water is supposed to be coming out, and you can see that when the robot is supposedly mopping, it's not even wet on the floor behind it. This is with the tank set to the high water flow setting. There is also no action involved with the mop, like it doing any scrubbing, and you are forbidden from putting any kind of cleaning product into the tank, so it really is just plain water being dragged on a maybe damp washcloth. At best, this will pick up dust, and some dirt, but not much else. Also, while the weaker vacuuming is made up for by the fact that I can run it automatically every night, since the mop is a manual intervention operation, I can't use frequent repetition to make up for the crummy mopping. As it is now, when I want to mop, I spray pretreatment on to anything I see on the floor that looks like it's not going to budge, then I have to make the robot go into the kitchen, then I wet the washcloth part of the water tank in the sink, attach the water tank, tell the robot to clean that one room, and then catch the robot before it goes back to the base which is on carpet, so I can remove the water tank, not like it actually makes the carpet wet at all. The most evidence I have usually that the floor was mopped is the fact that the washcloth on the water tank looks somewhat dirty.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 69, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Fletcher'}}, {'title': 'The only Robo Vacuum Cleaner I liked!', 'body': 'When the pandemic and stay at home orders hit, my wife wanted me to vacuum the house. I immediately started looking for Robo Cleaners. Over the past six weeks, I have tried four different models. It was something I did not like about each of the first three. I have a two story house with an elevated entry level that Robot cleaners cannot climb up to. That means I have in effect three floors on the house. In spite of promises, none of the other three could map and retain the maps for more than one floor at a time. The S6 pure can. Also, the S6 maps using a laser guidance system, not a camera. I think it may be more accurate in navigating and finding things, and of course could do the job in total darkness since lasers don’t need the lights on to work. This mapping function actually divides the floor into multiple rooms, this is a function I had to perform manually on other models I tested. If one wants to of course one can of further combine or divide the rooms or set the boundaries anywhere you want manually. One thing I miss on this model that other models that is that other models allowed you to label the names of the room, where is this as he does not. This may be improved on a future software update. However, I can still figure out which is the living room and which is the dining room on the map it draws. We have oriental rugs in some of the rooms. One of the other cleaners I tried promptly chewed up the fringes on the rug and curled it off. It sucked it into its apparatus and stopped and I had to freeze it. No matter what I tried to do or how low I placed the strings, , it constantly choked and had to be rescued every time it crossed the border of the oriental rug. (That one was returned in about two days.) The S6 nibbles the fringes a bit, but passes all of them OK. My wife did not like even that. On previous models, some allowed exclusion zones or no cross lines. This did not work. The no cross line did not work, because I want the vacuum to work on both sides of the line rather than just walling off a corner of the room. One of the other cleaners allowed you to map off a non-entry area. When I tried, the minimum width was something like 6 feet, which was way too large to use just on a fringe of an oriental carpet. Finally I tried the S-6 Pure. This is a brand new model from this company. I usually don’t like to buy things just as they are released, but the clock was ticking and I had no choice. However, I am extremely pleased with the product. As I said, it is brand new so I assume that everything is as up-to-date and improved as possible. It does indeed map more than one floor, and it has map three floors in my house. It has also made a pretty good guess as to how to divide all the rooms on the floor. These are modifiable if you wish. As I said, so far you cannot label the rooms, but that is not really necessary. I tried the no-go zone on this one. Unlike the other cleaner I try it, this cleaner allows a no go zone of perhaps 1 foot in width. This is perfect for the fringes on the carpet. I selected a no go zone around the fringes of the oriental rug and let the cleaner loose. One was pretty much perfect and one just nipple devoid of a little bit. I adjusted the border of the no go zone to include completely the fringes. Now the robot zooms around the living room but avoids the fringes of the oriental rug. I also set little no go zones around the vents which are on the floor in this room, so that the Robot cleaner does not go over the metal grating. This cleaner also has an option, which I have not tried yet, where it will vacuum at a lower strength on hard floors, but will sense when it is on a carpet or rug and increase the vacuum strength to vacuum these areas more heavily. This unit will also mop floors, obviously just smooth non-carpeted floors, but I really did not care about this function (though it is nice to have!). I am glad it is there because it might be of some use in the future, especially for kitchen and bathrooms. This unit has the largest battery size of the various sizes that are available in different manufacturers machines, so they charge more to list out as long as anybody else’s. It also has a vacuum setting which is among the strongest of the ones available in different models you might find. One additional thing I should say is that their customer service appears to be excellent. I have emailed them multiple times with various dumb questions, and I usually get a response within a day. Another nice thing is that they actually appear to read my question and do not give a boilerplate response. This is not the cheapest Robo vacuum cleaner on the market (not the most expensive), but if these features sound interesting to you, I have not found another cleaner even at a higher price that is it’s equal.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 43, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Robert Jay'}}, {'title': 'Very good and smart robot with some improvement needed', 'body': 'Overall I liked this product pretty much. I have a little one crawling all days and It frees my hand from daily mopping and vacuuming, especially during this pandemic time. People stays home most of time. It’s very smart when working with the app. I liked the room support feature and virtual wall which saves me lots of time, because the kitchen needs to clean everyday while other rooms doesn’t. It’s just couple click on the screen so it knows where to clean. There’s a small issue with the mopping. When the robot go thru. edge of the room, it actually can’t reach the very end of that line. My cleaning standards are pretty high so I will still need to manually mop that small part like every other week or so.  The only issue for S6 pure compared with S6 in mopping feature is that the plastic piece, which be used to attach a disposable mopping cloth, is not compatible with the PURE’s water tank because it blocks the air inlet of the tank. If you look closer to the PURE and s6 tank, you will find the air inlet location is not the same. So the S6 could work perfect with disposable cloth while the PURE could not. But this issue is not bothering me so much since the reusable mop cloth is very light and easy to clean. I can stand using the reusable ones before the updated compatible version is been developed and released on market.  One last thing I want to talk about is the multi floor mapping feature. S6 Pure has the support for multi floor mapping, but you will need to bring the charger/base together with the machine to a new level and let the machine always start from the base. Otherwise it may cause confusion to the data and current map might be overwritten (you don’t want to see this happen because you will have to remap that floor and all your rooms or virtual wall setting will be erased)', 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': 4, 'reviewer': {'name': 'lizhaoyan'}}, {'title': 'Outstanding Performance and Value', 'body': 'Let\\'s begin with the cons: 1) No clean base. You need to empty the small dust bin every few days, instead of emptying a bag every two weeks. If that\\'s a non-starter for you, then don\\'t buy this vac. 2) As with all combination vac/mops, the mopping performance is not good. As above, this is what I expected. 3) Although the room mapping is fantastic, it does not have the most advanced AI, and so it is more likely to ingest charger cords and doggie droppings if it encounters them. At this price, that is not surprising and I don\\'t know how well the very expensive AI robots avoid these hazards, only that they claim to.  Onto the pros: My previous vac was the iRobot Roomba i7+. My ex wound up with it. The Roomba was a much more expensive vac, especially with the clean base. While the Roomba\\'s clean base is fantastic, the Roborock S6 Pure beats the Roomba in every other way, by far. The very first time I used the Roborock, it created a very detailed map of the entire first floor of my house. The iPhone app displayed the map and made it very easy to assign rooms, so I can direct the vac to \"Clean Kitchen,\" for example. Setting up \"keep out zones\" is far easier and more effective with the Roborock. Huge plus to Roborock there! Also, you can set up several floors of maps, so you can carry the vac upstairs and it will map out and clean that floor without losing the first floor map. The Roomba didn\\'t seem to be able to do that very well.  The second huge improvement over the Roomba i7 is the efficiency. The Roomba just sort of bounces off the walls at random until it thinks it\\'s covered an entire room. And it bangs into objects very often, even in mapped-out rooms. The Roborock, by comparison, methodically cleans rooms in long, straight lines. The result is that it doesn\\'t miss spots and it cleans in far less time than the Roomba. Also, I don\\'t hear it constantly banging into things. When it goes back to base, it\\'s direct and it mates immediately. The Roomba would take forever to get to the cleaning base and even longer to line itself up to the charger pads. Then, the Roomba would empty itself into the clean base with a ferociously loud fan. Because of its efficiency, the Roborock finishes cleaning with more than 50% battery life left. The Roomba would need to return to dock, charge for a very long time, and then continue cleaning.  The third huge improvement is the noise. The Roborock is drastically quieter than the Roomba, and when you add in the faster vacuuming time, this is great for people who work at home... or anyone, for that matter.  As for smaller details: I have only hardwood floors, so I can\\'t comment on carpet performance. I do have a dog, and the Roomba\\'s brush, while easy to clean, definitely caught much more dog hair, and so despite the clean base, I had to frequently remove the brush and remove a substantial amount of hair from it. The Roborock catches far less hair in its roller. Big plus to the Roborock in this respect. Removing and cleaning the brushes is similar, although the Roborock has some tiny pieces which need to be reassembled correctly. The Roomba brush is a little bit easier to reassemble, but this is a minor issue.  Neither the Roomba i7 nor the Roborock S6 Pure have premium object avoidance. They will suck up charger cables, small socks, and other small obstacles if they encounter them. My big fear is doggie droppings. Although I haven\\'t had this catastrophe yet, i don\\'t think either vac will avoid sucking up and splattering doggie dirt and making a major mess. Otherwise, it\\'s a great vac to have if you have pets. Maybe not an un-housebroken puppy, though. There are the super-premium, AI robots which are said to be able to avoid dog droppings, but I don\\'t know if they work.  Overall, I highly recommend this product.

With that said, I did a ton of research and I couldn’t find a vacuum with better reviews than the Roborock series. I went with this one because it was $100 dollars off and only $30 more than the S5.  Suction- Great on hard surfaces, good on carpet. Brush- Impressive- rarely gets hair wrapped around it. Collection bin- Easy to remove and clean. Mop- Suprisingly good. I zone my kitchen in the app so that it goes over it 3 times and it does a very impressive job. Comparable to a swiffer. Navigation- Wow. Just as good as people reported. I am beyond impressed. The App- I learned it in no time. I used the Mi Home app because the Roborock app had a hard time finding my internet connection.  Overall this has been a game changer. I have read that robot vacuums can have a shorter shelf life so I bought the 3 year extended warranty on top of the 1 year manufacture warranty. That was $70, but it gives me piece of mind that this will work for the next 4 years. We run it twice a day. Have a two level home. Works great and automatically recognizes the second level. With COVID-19 our kids are at home all day and my wife loves that she can go up stairs and run the vacuum while she gets the kids started on school. I rarely review a product and I have been more then impressed with this one. It truly saves us time, and having freshly mopped and vacuumed floors makes you feel like life is not as crazy as it really is.  Questions I had that are answered? Can I name rooms and only run it in one room? Yes! And it works great and is accurate. You can also do a series of rooms. Does the mop recognize carpet? No. But, I mapped out the rooms with carpet and hard floors and it is no problem to run just the hard floors with the mop. Zones? What are they? You can select a zone and have the robot vacuum or mop that zone multiple times. Noise? Yes, you can hear it. Not annoying but I can hear it down stairs when I am up stairs. I can also watch TV in the same room while it is running. Quality and Build? Seems very high quality. Cons- More suction on carpet would be nice but it still does a great job. The app took a little time to learn. Replacement pads, brushes, etc are available but a little $$$. You can get knock off replacement parts but I haven’t bought them because the reviews are mixed and the original parts seem very high quality. With that said, if you replace the brush, the filter and the pads you are looking at $70.

Then I watched it roll over a piece of carpet fuzz, and the fuzz was still there when the robot moved on. I re-positioned the fuzz in front of the Roborock and watched it again roll right over it. So I next put the piece of fuzz directly in the center of the path and this time it picked it up. I looked around and found a few other small pieces of stuff on the carpet and repeated the experiment: the only time it picked-up anything larger than dust was when it was in the middle of the robot's cleaning path. The same was true on tile floors but with a little wider center-path tolerance.  If you look at the first picture the problems become obvious: First, the suction hole over the cleaning brush is very small. So small it can be covered by three George Washington quarters! Second, the suction hole is located *above* the roller brush, so dirt has to be lifted vertically an inch or two. For a small battery powered vacuum, this is a big deal. To illustrate, compare the work required to push a friend's car, versus lifting the car an inch or two.  I purchased a second robot vacuum, a Shark Vacmop Pro RV2001WD, with similar features to the Roborock S6 Pure. Look at the second photo showing the Shark suction hole. It was so large that quarters would fall through it, and it extended the entire width of the roller brush. (I have a separate review of the Shark unit and please read that if you are considering buying it.)  I ran a performance test comparing the Roborock S6 Pure and the Shark Vacmop Pro RV2001WD. Both units were set to Maximum for the test. I had been using both units alternating days for a week before I started this test. In a single day I ran four cleaning cycles, Roborock-Shark-Roborock-Shark, one after the other, letting the batteries recharge before starting the second cleaning run. The results were shocking. I weighed the dirt in each vacuum's dust chamber using a bullion scale, weighing the chamber before and after vacuuming (they were both cleaned before each test).  See the photos showing the dirt collected in each cleaning pass.  Pass #1 Roborock: 2.6 grams Pass #2 Shark: 6.0 g Pass #3 Roborock: 1.3 g Pass #4 Shark: 3.0 g  Even though the Shark cleaned immediately *after* the Roborock, in both cases the Shark pulled up over twice as much dirt as the Roborock did just beforehand!! I ran a third pair of passes the next morning and the pattern repeated (there was so little dirt in the Roborock that I couldn't weigh it).  The difference is mostly due to the Shark suction hole being so much larger, and only having to sweep the dirt horizontally into the vacuum air stream (no vertical lifting of dirt).  This is a design flaw with the Roborock that can't be overcome with a battery powered vacuum. Wall-powered vacuum cleaners generate huge amounts of vacuum compared to these robot-vacs, and the cleaning brushes are larger and driven by much stronger motors.  On the positive side, the mapping function in the Roborock app is excellent (the Shark's is not). It is accurate, easy to use, and was good at detecting/avoiding objects/obstacles. Setting up no-go areas and invisible walls was straight-forward and worked well. The large battery size is a plus and could clean my home using about half the battery capacity. The dirt chamber is easy to clean (even though there wasn't much in it). The air filter is supposed to be washable but I won't have the unit long enough to find out.

So far, I\\'ve run 4 full cycles in my multi-level home with great results. I\\'m going to break down my review into, what I think, are the most important things people look for in a robotic vacuum.  Suction: As a dog owner, we wanted something that worked well picking up hair on both carpeted and wood floor surfaces. So far, it\\'s done just as well as our stand-up vacuum at removing pet hair from these surfaces. The vacuum has a setting to automatically detect when it\\'s on carpet and go into \"carpet mode\", which is essentially the highest power mode. After its first and 2nd cleanings, I was pleasantly surprised to see a mostly full dust cup and little to no traces of dog hair anywhere.  Navigation: Since this vacuum has LIDAR, it will map out the area it is cleaning continually. The first time you run the vacuum, it does take extra long because it kind of splits your area into different zones while scanning. Don\\'t worry, after it\\'s mapped the entire area, the next time it vacuums it will be much more efficient. It will clean in a \"Z\" pattern instead of randomly bouncing around the room like some dumber robotic vacuums. My basement for example took 79 minutes to map and vacuum the first run, but only 50 the 2nd run because its pathing was much more efficient. If you have a multi-level home, you\\'ll have to specify that in the app settings. Then when you have one floor completely mapped, you can \"add a map\" from the \"edit map\" menu and then your vacuum will map out the other area. It does a nice job avoiding obstacles as it also has a cliff sensor, a bump sensor, along with the LIDAR. It will dock automatically when done cleaning or if it needs to fill up on battery before finishing the cleaning routine.  Battery: Since most of my house is carpeted, it\\'s in carpet mode most of the time, which is essentially the \"max suction\" setting. The vacuum just this morning cleaned about 800sq feet and had 60% battery left when finished. If you have wood floors and run a lower power setting, you could easily stretch the battery to over 2000sq feet.  Noise: Even at the max setting, the vacuum does not get very loud. I could have a normal volume conversation with someone with it running in the same room. If you want to have it run while you\\'re sleeping, it does have a quiet mode, which I have to say, is pretty darn quiet. In the app you can also set a DND time where it will automatically pause any cleaning, turn off the AI voice, and dim the lights on the vacuum itself.  App: The Roborock app has worked well for me so far. There are a plethora of settings to look at and personalize to your liking. You can do things like set schedules, edit the maps, remote control the vacuum, and much more. The map editor is pretty intuitive. You can set virtual invisible walls, split your areas into zones, customize how many times you want the vacuum to cover each zone, etc. The app tries its best to automatically create zones (rooms) by itself after mapping, but there is a manual way to merge and split areas if it doesn\\'t do it correctly.  Mopping: While I haven\\'t tried the mopping yet, I will give a tip. When you have the mop attached with water, there is no way to toggle it on or off. If it\\'s attached, it will attempt to mop. If you have a home like mine, my kitchen and dining area is wood floors, while the rest of my main floor is carpeted. I don\\'t want water all over my carpet. So what you can do is create a \"zone\" in the map editor just for the wooded areas. When you set your vacuum to clean, you can tell it just to clean certain zones (they are color coded). That way, you don\\'t have to worry about it trying to mop your carpet.  Overall, a very solid vacuum so far. I will update my review if anything changes. Roborock has a strong track record with their vacuums all the way back to the S3. If you have a multi-level home and are looking to break into the robotic vacuum market, the Roborock S6 Pure is my recommendation to make that happen.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 152, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Wesley Danger'}}, {'title': 'Very Good but Unexpected Downside', 'body': 'This is my 3rd robot vacuum. My first was a Ecovacs bought on sale for under $200 about 3 years ago. I loved it but after 7 months, it stopped connecting to internet. Company sent replacement (after 10 calls to company). Second one did the exact same thing - 7 months in it stopped connecting to internet. Company sent a 3rd replacement (another 10 calls and a very unpleasant company person telling me that even if the 3rd replacement stops working they will not replace again). Again, it stopped at about 7 months. While the thing worked, it was great - enough power to get over kitchen/dinning room transition bump, good app that let me know how long it ran for each cleaning, easy to schedule cleanings (I usually have it set for twice a week while I\\'m at work), an a long enough battery that even though it was ping ponging around space, it would really clean everything.  Decided to change brands. I researched for about a month and decided on an Eufy for about $220. I picked this one because it was thinner than the Ecovacs and had good reviews. One of the things I didn\\'t like about the ecovacs (aside from the 7 month lifespan) was that 1 out of every 3 runs through house, it would get wedged under cabinets in kitchen because the very thin carpet runner was just a mm too high and if front wheel was on tile and back wheel was still on carpet near the cabinets, wedge city. The Eufy never got wedged but a huge problem was that it did not have the power to get over the divider bump between kitchen tile and hardwood floor in dinning room (bathroom was same issue). I pushed it into kitchen and bathroom for a year. I also did not like the app because it did not tell you how long it ran for each time. Battery life was good and house felt \"vacuumed\" when I got home from work (I blocked off kitchen/bath so it would not get stuck but that is not really the point of having a robot vacuum - I don\\'t want to have to vacuum kitchen/bath when I get home).  This time I really did my research and also decided to splurge. I bought the Roboroc Pure about 2 weeks ago. This one is not the random ping pong, but the mapping kind. Easy to set up and connect to internet. I really like that the app give lots of info such as how much battery is used, how long cleaning lasted for each run, and it was easy to schedule run times. It has gone through my house 4 times. Has enough power to get over kitchen/bath transition, is thin enough so it won\\'t get wedged under cabinets (I even checked if one wheel is on carpet and one on tile and no wedge city). Really great suction so my all hardwood floor, 1000 sq ft house really, really feels vacuumed (except for 1 small area - see below). No dust balls in corners that got left behind. It runs around the perimeter first and then runs on lines through rest of space. It makes one pass through house and returns to dock.  Here is the one thing I wish was different about this vacuum. With the ping pong robots, they need long battery life because they just go random around the space until the battery needs recharging and then it goes back to dock. They ran over same space multiple times in my house (not that big) so everything was really picked up. This robot runs through house once and then goes back to base even if battery still has life. The run time is about 45 minutes and it still has 70% battery left. I close doors to office and spare room because they are very small rooms with not much floor space to vacuum (too much furniture to make it worth it). I wish it would go back over house a second time or just keep going until battery is done. The four times it has run, I have noticed that it did not pick up everything on carpet runner in kitchen (thin carpet tiles from Flor). If the robot made a second pass through kitchen, I\\'m sure it would get everything. I was not expecting this feature in the mapping type of vacuum and not a single reviewer mentioned this feature (I watched a lot of reviews). I guess the solution is to just schedule more days to run but I do have to \"vacuum proof\" the house a bit before each run (pick up dog food/water bowls, pick up small rug in bathroom, put folding chair in kitchen up on counter and put small cube ottoman on couch). Or schedule multiple run times on same day which is what I will probably do. Other small issues to consider - 1 rotating brush up front on vacuum which does not pop off like other two vacs This makes it harder to clean out hair that gets tangled around that brush. Dust bin is a bit smaller than other two vacs. The first \"map\" of my house was very accurate but the second and third time it ran, the map did not represent all the spaces. I wanted to set it to run in just the kitchen but I did not turn on the map saving feature, so I\\'m not sure if I can schedule just one room. Have to experiment with that.  So far, I really do like this vacuum. I won\\'t ever use the mop feature so I can\\'t say anything about that. It has good suction, it has enough power to go everywhere, does not get wedged anywhere, and my floors feel very clean when its done. I was worried about only one rotating brush on front of vacuum but so far, it seems like it really does it\\'s job. Minus the one thing of not doing a second pass through house, I would recommend this vacuum. I know that it takes a few weeks to really get used to each vacuum and understand the quirks (which is why I know how to \"vacuum proof\" the house before leaving for work on days it will run).

(Ok.....we miss days but damn, we try!) When I'm away days at a time, they get groomed less. They also experience stress and when dogs are stressed, they shed more (I learned that from google).  So in my effort to decrease the need for my time and effort on things . . . Vs my need for some stuff to get done, a robotic vacuum seemed a very possible time and effort saver.  It sweeps. It does well around table legs. It's also supposed to mop. I havent gotten around to testing the mopping yet. I limited it to two rooms for testing purposes. I followed all the instructions. And it does a great job! My floors are cleaner than when I do them myself!  Meeko is jumpy around all things noisy or electronic. He stayed out of this things way.  Lucy tends to get happy when I'm cleaning, and watches proudly whenever I haul out the vacuum cleaner to do stuff. Unsure why, but she seems to connect cleaning efforts with worthwhile humans.  So lucy sniffed it over as it moved around working and seemed to decide this beast was a worthwhile addition to the household. She got comfortable with it moving around the room doing its job.  ......maybe a little too comfortable.  I hear a racket and see lucy rapidly emerging from her favorite corner lounging spot with a look of horror on her face. She runs a couple of steps then stops, curves, and grabs at something. Then again, and again, until shes far enough into the room I can see that the robotic vacuum has gotten ahold of her tail hair. She doesnt know whether to run from it or bite it.  At the back end of her, the round shaped contraptions three brushes are spinning wildly tangling more and more of her long hair. It's at an angle that kinda makes it look like a belly up crawdad with the brushes being the arms with pinchers.

I'd love to say that lucy was immediately freed of the annoyance......but that be a lie. I was laughing so hard that it took me a bit to figure out how to get it off of her. My laughter further antagonized poor lucy because she hates to be the butt of jokes. I am unsure how the attack vacuum felt about my laughter.  So.....in way more time than I'd like to admit, the dog and vacuum were separated. They all seem fine. Although......the stress is likely causing lucy to shed even more. She and the vacuum may develop a symbiotic relationship. The vacuum has earned my respect! It got bounced around a bit, but once freed and untangled, it calmly went right back to cleaning my floors.

It may be cheaper on other sites, but the Amazon customer service convinced me to pay a little extra. 2. Quiet Its, so I can work and take calls without being disturbed. 3. Low Height It can easily go under my couches Measure and compare heights before buying. 4. Dual Brushes Having two brushes allows the vacuum to clean dirt near the floorboards without scratching 5. Sensors The sensors are not too sensitive, which is good for cleaning near floorboards. 6. Mopping Function It holds enough liquid to mop my 3 bedroom and does a great job cleaning the floors. 7. Large Dustbin I can do multiple cleanings before needing to empty the dustbin. Just make sure to check the suction chamber before each cleaning. 8. Long Running Time On a full charge, the vacuum runs for about 75 minutes. Using the max function may reduce the running time. 9. Strong Suction The suction is great for hardwood and tile floors, but not as effective on thin rugs. It may hold onto larger items that can't fit into the dustbin. 10. Convenient Remote The remote is easy to use, and the robot follows commands well. 11. Spot/Edge Functions The spot and edge functions work well for cleaning specific areas and edges of the room. 12. Rug Compatibility The vacuum can easily transition from hardwood/tile to rugs, but may push up rug corners if it hits them. 13. Cord Management Make sure to secure cords against the wall to prevent the vacuum from getting stuck. 14. Excellent Customer Service The seller provided great customer service and resolved issues promptly, making the purchase worth it. Cons: 1. Lack of Virtual Wall The vacuum does not have a virtual wall feature and may fall off stairs. 2. Random Cleaning In larger spaces, the vacuum may not pick up all debris, especially under furniture. 3. The auto home feature does not work when the robot is is the next room Additional Notes: This vacuum works well on hardwood and tile floors, and the spot cleaning function is useful for tough spots.

I have replaced parts on it and put in a new battery, but it just sort of does its own thing. So, I decided to try this since it was on a Prime Special in July. I had also done some research and found recommendations from some experts. This was one of those recommendations, sort of. The recommended one was the version without Alexa and Google integration. I started to get it and Amazon showed a newer version and it was only $20 more. Plus, this one mops, too. My hopes when ordering it: it would be more quiet than my Roomba, it would not get stuck under so many things, it would pick up things as well since it doesn’t have a brush or roller, it would map my home and rooms (my old one had no smart features like that), that there would be some method to its vacuuming, that the app would be user friendly, that the battery lasts around 100 minutes as advertised, and that it would actually work with Alexa and Google.  I was so disappointed in most aspects. Let’s get this out of the way first, the product description mentions mapping, but there is none. The setup was not too bad. I had to connect to Wi-Fi several times before it finally took. There is nothing in the instructions to tell you which way the button is pressed on the side of the vacuum for on/off, and this is a necessary step in setup and charging. For information, press the button on the “O” icon and not the “-“ icon to turn the thing on. I let this charge overnight as it suggested. Lights flash to let you know it is charging and all lights but the one on the base go off when it is finished. It charges regardless of the position of the on/off switch although the instructions say it does not.  Setting up the clock on the remote was okay. I never could get the remote to start the vacuum cleaning. I was able to get the app connected to Alexa easily. I was never able to get it to sync up with Google Home, but this seems to be the case with almost all smart devices I have. Here, Google Home will ask you to download a separate app if you want to connect to Google Home and are having trouble with the Google Home app doing so. Upon downloading the suggested app, there was zero help or steps to follow to connect it, so I just decided to forget Google Home.  I pressed “clean” on the robot, and it went forward into the base, backed up, did some spins, and finally took off. I included a video of the initial run to show how minimal the noise is. I was pleased with this since my old Roomba is rather loud and always has been. I was also mostly pleased with the robot’s ability not to run hard into walls and objects. I say mostly because sometimes it did. It will not go under a bed if there is any bedding that drapes down close enough to the floor that the robot sees as a wall or whatever. This was disappointing. The robot has a lot of power in the drive mechanism. I say this because a couple pieces of furniture that I have are crafted with curved metal legs. The robot literally ran up these metal legs a little way. This was not good.  I spent almost as much time getting the robot un-stuck from places as I did getting to relax while it cleaned. You cannot remove the mop pad from the robot and clean the house if you have ANY rugs that the robot will run over. I have some really thin rugs under some chairs to protect my hardwood floors. Without the mop pad on the robot, it got stuck and pulled the rugs up every time it tried to run over them due to the hook-and-loop finish on the bottom side of the robot to hold the pads on. I ended up having to put the mop pad back on. It really did not do very well on the edges of the rooms either. And any cords that were even close to being along an edge ended up stopping the robot after it got all tangled up in them. I did not even try the mop feature. I was too frustrated with the poor performance of this robot vacuum already. So, I used the app (which is not very feature-rich at all) and pressed the charge button so that the vacuum would return to its base. It took almost 5 minutes for it to return to its base.  I had this running for about 40 minutes (including the time I spent finding it stuck or getting it -un-stuck) and the battery was about 2/3 down. It did pick up quite a bit of stuff. I currently do not have pets and live alone. A photo is included of the dirt bin, which is fairly simple to access and empty. Being so disappointed in this robot vacuum, I boxed it up and started the return process. I hooked up my old Roomba again and let it vacuum some of the areas already vacuumed by this iLife vacuum. I closed off all my other rooms and let it do the main portion and only where the iLife had cleaned already. I posted a photo of the Roomba dirt bin after doing this. Keep in mind that I had thoroughly cleaned my Roomba up, including the dust bin, since I thought I was going to store it away. I was quite surprised by how much dirt the iLife missed.  So really, the noise level and the not bumping into most things hard were about the only things I liked about this iLife robotic vacuum.

Always found them gimmicky because I am a clean freak and thought I can clean my home better than anyone or anything. But my bf and I work 6 days a week 10 hour shifts, so the little time we get at home we want to enjoy it instead of cleaning. We bought this vacuum for the convenience of it, with no high expectations. I like the concept and I can’t compare since this is my first one. But this particular one had some qualities that lead me to a return. 1. It has a mop feature which comes with a Velcro attachment, the Velcro on the vacuum itself when in vacuum mode with get stuck to ALL your carpets and cause them to start tearing and looking ugly! I only used it once to notice that. The Velcro will tug on carpet to be aware, unless I attach the mop rag but I didn’t want that catching the dirt instead of the vacuum itself. 2. There is no smart mapping which causes it to miss areas or rooms ALL TOGETHER. 3. It will die before it even finished cleaning your home. ( I have a two bedroom 2 bath apt.) never finished a full vacuum before dying. 4. It does not know the difference when mopping the floor to carpet. It will mop your carpets and not avoid them! 5. You need to take out the water on the mopping feature once done because there is no sense of stopping the water it will just leak out the bottom. So I cannot mop when I leave the house because it will mop my carpets or leak water everywhere. 6. You also have to switch the attachments to vacuum then to mop, it will not just do one then the other. You need to manually change the attachments in order to get a vacuum then a mop. 7. I basically feel like I need to babysit it and it’s supposed to help me not add a watching task. 8. The scheduling on the app and control simply doesn’t work. You will have to manually turn it on at work on the app etc. price is great for a first time buyer but not really worth it in my opinion given the cons, I’d rather try a more advanced one and a little more cost.

Performance Vacuuming: The V5s Pro performs well on hard floors and low-pile carpets. It uses two side brushes and a central suction port to collect dust and debris. While it lacks a roller brush, it compensates with strong suction power, making it effective for everyday cleaning1. Mopping: The mopping function is a nice addition, but it’s more of a light mopping feature rather than a deep clean. It works best on hard floors and can handle light spills and dirt2.

This is part 1 of what may end up a much longer review. For those in a rush, read this summary and watch the very short video!  Summary: At about 1/2 the price of the two “big” brands (both of which I have used) this one is quieter and easier to clean. There are far less fidgety parts to unsnap to simply empty the container holding the debris. The remote control does a fine job when needed, and the vacuum does actually return to the docking station when needed. It is quiet, not frightening to cats and comes with spare parts. The “damp mop\" does exactly that. It is not a scrubber, but a micro-fiber damp cloth that picks up fine dust. A solid unit. Now, if you want more info, read on.  ###  First, a few points: I am not a robot enthusiast who is forgiving of robotic devices that don’t work well. I also do not expect any robot to do heavy housework, especially at this price point. If you are expecting a robot to relieve you of household drudgery, come back in 50 years.  At about 1/2 the price of the two “big” brands (both of which I have used) this one holds it’s own and more. It is more attractive, more effective and less trouble to use and clean. This unit is logically designed, easy to maintain and, again, also quiet.  Because it is designed for WOOD and TILE floors, NOT CARPET, it does not have the rubber rolling beater that others use to get debris out of carpet pile. It uses an effective vacuum built into a mobile chassis. If you imagine a decent “Dustbuster” type mechanism on wheels, you get the idea.  The center of the unit has a box-like chamber a bit smaller than a 1 lb butter package or 3x5“ card recipe box. If you put the vacuum module in, it collects debris and exhausts air through a small HEPA filter. The filter is cleanable and comes with extras. You can order more if needed.  In vacuum mode, the unit moves around the room at a steady pace with two brushes spinning that direct debris towards center vacuum area. While it will gently bump into chair legs, etc., it seems to sense walls and backs away without touching them. It also has a mode that hugs the wall to brush debris out of the edges of the room into the unit. There is also a “spill” mode where the unit circles around in an ever-larger circle for those times when dry coffee grounds, flour, ashes, etc. are dropped. There is also a “turbo” mode where the vacuum strength is increased. This produces more noise. As our 1900 farmhouse is mostly troubled by road dust and cat hair or tracked litter, the regular setting was fine.  You will need to check the debris container fairly often. Even in a well-maintained house like ours, it is surprising how quickly the iHome “Beetle” fills up with found dust and fur!  Yes, it would be nice to have a larger debris receptacle, but then EVERYTHING would have to be larger..larger vacuum motor, larger housing, larger battery, larger motor for transport, etc. You would end up with something bigger and heavier than a Thanksgiving turkey that could not get into tight places.  I did bring the iHome Beetle into what call my “torture track.” My home recording studio is often messy with extension cords, twist-ties from product packaging that missed the trash can and just the stuff that gets left in my sort of technological “man cave.” The Beetle handled it well, getting over wires and dealing with just about everything...except those twist ties, which it ignored. By the way, there have been no jam-ups plugging the vacuum path as it is pretty straight. The only time I thought it was jammed turned out that the debris chamber was full!  Replace the vacuum box with the water box and you have a damp-mop system AFTER you add a simple bracket to the underside to hold the micro-fiber cloth. It takes a bit, but the cloth does get damp and collects fine dust as the Beetle makes it way around the room. Damp-mopping is not the same as scrubbing! This is not going to take a dingy kitchen floor, clean it and make it sparkle! But being very, very familiar with damp-mopping Army barracks floors, I can tell you that it does make floors look better!  This unit comes with a dock, or you can plug the charger directly into the unit. I’m not sure how it works, but when you hit the “home” button on the remote, the Beetle stops what it is doing and heads right over to the dock and settles in. Fascinating! It even did it when certain wise-guy cats tried to knock it off course.  Speaking of cats, I repeat that there is no rapidly spinning rubber axel on the front used to beat carpet fibers because this is not for carpets. The first time I used another brand (we’ll call it “R”), a cat got in the way and got it’s tail yanked by the vacuum. My other vac (we’ll call in “N”) never got that far, as the electronics were all messed up from the moment I opened the box.  Using the dock and the remote, you can tell the Beetle when to start and when to quit and go back home. I have not used it long enough to make use of this, but from what I can see, there is no reason to doubt it works. I have also not tested the “cliff detection” and note that even the instructions caution it may not work in all circumstances. The edges of our steep wood stairway have rounded edges after 117 years, and the Beetle might not realize that!  The instructions are quite good and the unit, in it’s attractive box, is very easy to set up. Great wedding gift!  A final important note: This is not one of those products, like so many coffee makers and kitchen items, that are sold “generically” to an importer and found with five brand names and no support. iHome is making a very serious effort in this marketplace and has a website and help, not just a name attached to a product that nobody knows much about.

Pros: 1. the price. you can't beat it. it's much cheaper than the more known brands like roomba. side note, i did find it up to $40 less on other sites, and frankly think $159 is a more accurate price for this product, but when buying a product made in china, the amazon superior customer service tilted me toward paying the extra. 2. noise level. it's quieter than my dirt devil, so i can hear the tv and do other things without feeling disturbed. 3. height. I LOVE THE HEIGHT. it easily goes under my dressers, armoire. So if this is a function you want measure and compare before you buy. I tried another vacuum that was just a tad under 3 inches and it didn’t go under as easily. 4. the brushes. i love there are two because it really does allow the vacuum to get dirt by the floorboards. Further, the brushes are plastic but not so hard they scratch my hardwoods. 5. sensors. this is a pro and a con. the pro is they're not so sensitive the brushes can't get dirt by the floorboards. However, because they are not sensitive, if the vacuum encounters a light weight object, it will push against it and if it can, roll over it and keep going. 6. the mop. i actually love this function. the tank is small but holds more than enough liquid to mop my 750 sq ft apartment. Based on other reviews, before I mop I run the vacuum. Recharge, then mop. When I mop, I dampen the mop pad slightly, and the liquid I use is either a water diluted hardwood floor cleaner or water diluted tile cleaner. Both cleaners are thinnish so the water holes don’t clog. It really does clean my floor. 7. dustbin. I can do 2 plus cleanings before I need to empty. However, before each cleaning I check the suction chamber to make sure nothing is stuck. 8. running time. Mine runs about 75 minutes on a full charge. If I use the max function it runs maybe half the time. 9. suction. The suction is more than sufficient for my hardwoods and tile, however it does not work as well on my thin rugs. It does work well enough, and if some lint is not picked up I just run my hand-held vacuum or dirt devil. Further, if it encounters something too big to suck up into the dustbin but small enough to suck up, the suction will hold on to the item and keep going. Usually I can hear when this happens so I just remove the item. 10. remote. Love this remote. Easy to use and read, and the robot obeys commands. I especially like that when I tell it to go in a specific direction I don’t have to keep my finger on the arrow button so it continues in that direction. 11. spot/edge functions. They really work. With the spot function, the vacuum goes in a small circle then gradually widens the circle. The edge function works well for floorboards and closed closets. 12. rugs. My rugs are thin, so the vacuum has no problem moving from hardwood/tile to the rug and back again. I did notice if it hits the rug on a corner it may push the corner up. Then it will either back up and change directions, or keep going and clean that corner later. Lol 13. cords. Only once did my vacuum get stuck. I forgot to push the cords against the wall. To get more corners/floorboards cleaned, I bought cord clips so the cords are now off the floor. 14. customer service. Avalon Direct. I was missing the mop holder. The seller was on holiday and not returning until after my 30-day return period. When I contacted the “on holiday” seller, they could not have been more helpful, and really went out of their way to make me satisfied. In fact, they were so helpful, even though I knew I would not get the part until after the return period, I felt I could trust them to make things right. They did. Again, this is why I paid $40 extra to purchase from amazon. Great seller backed by amazon. Cons: 1. sensors. there is no virtual wall. it will fall off a stair. 2. random cleaning. i put dirt (potting soil, popcorn kernels, lint, ... ) on different spots, including under a dresser. the larger the space, the less chance the vacuum will pick up something. my kitchen and bathroom are small so they were cleaned 99%. the bedroom and living room are larger spaces so the cleaning was about 95%. 3. removing and replacing dustbin/water basin. You pop the lid open (I usually have to push the pop button several times because you have to hit it just right), then pull the dustbin or basin out. Don’t pull too hard you can break the handle, but you have to pull hard enough to get it to come out. I would prefer if it just slid in and out like some other robot vacuums. 4. no brush. I really wish it had a brush with the suction. Additional notes: - the mop function was important to me. if it's not as important to you, there are other vacuums like the A4 by iLife that probably are fantastic and inexpensive. - I have hardwoods and tile. i found it vacuums and mops both equally well. if there's a spot that needs extra cleaning, use the spot cleaning function. - I also bought a Coredy robotic vacuum. It was taller so had more difficulty getting under furniture. Worse it was loud. I returned it. - finally, my test for how much I like a product is whether I would buy it again. I say yes, but with a caveat. iLife is coming out with new models this year. If there is a better model, I’ll be upset because buying another robot vacuum is not in my budget. But for this, heck yes, I’d buy again.  Feel free to ask me any questions, and I’ll try to update after I’ve had it a few months. UPDATE: i've had my vacuum a couple of months and i still love it. i use it once a week to vacuum, then mop the next day. i like that i can add my regular hardwood and tile cleaner to the water dispenser. the pads really do pick up things the vacuum may have missed, and if you spot clean with the pad 98% of the time the stain is gone.

From the moment I set it up, it has been a game-changer for keeping my home spotless. The setup was incredibly easy, and the app integration is seamless, allowing me to schedule cleanings even when I'm not at home. The suction power is phenomenal, effortlessly picking up dust, pet hair, and debris from both carpets and hardwood floors. I love how it navigates around furniture and obstacles with ease, ensuring that every corner of my home gets cleaned. One of my favorite aspects is the advanced mapping technology. The battery life is impressive, easily handling my entire home on a single charge. The robot is quiet, efficient, and incredibly effective. It has truly made my life easier, and I can't imagine going back to manual vacuuming.

With simplified step-by-step instructions and a better mobile app interface, the initial setup is easy to follow It is a Tighter integration, ensuring more stable connectivity and smoother firmware upgrades for constant peak performance relative to its previous model. Better Cleaning: Easily one of the most remarkable features on this new model is the mop that sits below, giving an extra touch to cleaning where it previously was nonexistent. The cleaning feature works best on hard floors and allows you to wet mop the floor while vacuuming. The mop built up to a lather and got rid of all the surface dirt while cleaning my floor.That seems like a huge leap forward, making the new vacuum light years better than its predecessor. Increased Suction Power: The new model also features a huge boost in suction power. In less passes, it does a better job at gathering up dust, dirt and pet hair as well. All with a fraction of the effort it typically takes to clean and without missing even one corner in your home. The extra power is evident over other models, particularly in heavy-pile carpets and high dust situations than before. Battery Life: The new model's battery has a big impact on its run time. The vacuum now cleans for longer before it needs to charge, which works great for big houses or lots of rooms. When I tried it out, I cleaned my whole house and it didn't have to go back to its charger. This longer battery life makes the device more productive and easier to use. Conclusion: The new model beats the old one in all the key areas. It's easier to use, cleans better with its built-in mop, sucks up more dirt, and runs longer. This model is worth buying for any home. I think you should get one!\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 30, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Great Buyer'}}, {'title': 'Absolutely worth the price', 'body': \"I have the previous model as well and I love both. I think this one might have a bigger motor which makes it louder. That's my only complaint.  I love that it works on the same app and that I can schedule when it cleans. There is a remote that comes with it if you don't like smart phone apps, but I prefer the app - which also tells you how long it's been running and its current battery life. It beeps loudly when it gets stuck or there's a problem. Hair can get stuck on the brushes, but they pop on and off, so that's easy to fix. The tank is awesome! Super easy to clean and the filters are cheap.  I've owned the old model for about 6 months and only had a problem with it docking once. I've had this one for about a month - no problems with this one so far.  The mop portion is nice. I need to look into buying more mop cloths, it only comes with one. The water use is efficient and dries fast.  You need to keep things off of the floor and I've needed to adapt to putting charge cords up, but outside of that, I rarely have to think about it and the dust and pet dander is down.

Hellooo, one-time payment, Robot Vacuum & Mop Cleaner!', 'body': 'Off to a good start, I was impressed with the sturdy, clean packaging of the G90 Intelligent Vacuum Cleaner and its content layout, with the User and App Manuals conveniently placed on top of everything. I glimpsed over the User Manual to get an idea of the setup process. It seemed it was going to be a time consuming process, but when I actually dove into it, it was very simple and straightforward. Start off removing the protective white tabs on the robot, installing the two brushes underneath the robot, and fully charging your robot by using the dock or robot directly. Easy. While it\\'s charging, download the ROPVACNIC app on your mobile device or scan the QR code found in the App Manual. Tip: The manual instructs you to turn on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth beforehand, but you should also make sure that \"Nearby Devices\" is enabled in your \"App Permissions\" settings to make automatic detection of your device model a breeze! The app is user-friendly, allowing you to create schedules, connect with Google Assistant or Gemini, and allows control of the device. I personally like using the remote control that it comes with versus the app. I like the remote in my hand while the vacuum is running so I can quickly tell it to turn if I\\'m avoiding a certain area, an obstacle in its path that could cause an error if jammed, change the suction, or tell it to go back to its charging station. It has a sensor on the front to detect objects, which does better than I expected, and sometimes it slightly bangs into the object, but immediately corrects its direction. My kids love when our robot \"bangs its head\" and some of their small, stuffed animals can hop on for a ride around the house, so that\\'s a bonus for the kids! Speaking of kids, that\\'s the reason I purchased a robot vacuum in the first place. Kids are messy, running in and out of the house with their dirty shoes on, dropping food and crumbs as they eat, dripping their sticky popsicles all over the floor... I can\\'t sweep and mop the floors enough! One day it\\'s spotless, the next day it looks as if I haven\\'t cleaned it in weeks. That\\'s where the idea of finally having my own Intelligent Robot Vacuum and Mop Cleaner came into play. It keeps up with our daily mess, helps me feel more comfortable when people come over for surprise visits, and makes my floors look like they did in my pre-children days! The battery lasts a long time, components are easy to disassemble for maintenance cleaning, and the mop function is a savior in removing dark circles from spilled/dripped liquid found in my heavily trafficked kitchen and bathroom, both on the main floor. Lastly, maintaining this product is the same maintenance as my normal, handheld vacuum cleaner, in that, after every use, I flip the vacuum over to remove all of the hair that got stuck around the rod and bristles, empty the dirt compartment, clean the filter, and lightly clean the wheels of dust and leftover dirt. The same thing goes for this robot, except I didn\\'t have to do the actual work! When you wash your floors, you fill a mop bucket with water and soap, make sure you have a clean sponge or start off with a good rinsed one, and then you clean out the bucket and mop when you\\'re done. Same idea with the robot, you fill and empty its tank, clean the mop, and make sure it\\'s dry before reassembling it. Even easier now that you didn\\'t have to do the actual work, AGAIN! 5 Stars for assisting with simplifying my insanely busy mom-life!', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 16, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Jfer'}}, {'title': 'Great for daily maintenance cleaning', 'body': \"This is no frills vacuum that is good for daily maintenance cleaning.

I simply grab the remote and hit 'go' when I leave my apartment, and come home to spotless floors and the robot safely parked on the charging dock. It has no trouble navigating between my hardwood floor and over various rugs. It will even go into my bathroom and clean up the tile, hopping over my 1 inch stone bathmat like it's nothing. It has really solid collision detection and will slow down along the edges of walls and cabinets to clean the baseboards, and has not trouble going under my table and bed, areas that I could never maintain even when vacuuming every day. Even when my floors look nice I will run it on my way out, and still find a significant amount of dust and pet hair run through the built-in HEPA filter that I'd otherwise be breathing in.  And here's the thing! This has built in wifi and app support, and the ability to mop, and I haven't even tried it yet! I simply let it vacuum and it is already a five star product. I've only had it get stuck twice since I've had it, and that's been from leaving a very long cable out on the floor, or a rubberband which gets caught on the wheel. It even has custom notifications to let you know where the obstruction is, in my case the right wheel with a rubberband. From there you just pull it out, hit 'go home' and the little buddy heads right back to the charging dock.

BUY ONE!', 'body': 'I had seen the original robot vacuums, the ones that randomly bounced around, and never really cleaned well. I didn\\'t realize how much better they had been. But, I saw this amazing deal on Black Friday and figured I would try it out, finally. I plugged it in a the app said it needed to map my house. I didn\\'t think much, but I assumed like the old style I would have to help get it \"unstuck\" and \"unlost\" over and over again. I pressed start and forgot about it. Later I see the vacuum on the base/charger and assume it never started, I open the app to start the mapping and I am greeted by a literally perfect map of the first floor of my house. I put the room dividers in manually, in 2 minutes, and it was mapped. I set the edge of the stairs to my basement as \"no-go\" zone, because I was scared it would fall down, and it never has. So, I was pleasantly pleased. Then, the next day I opened the bin expecting to see some hair and dust, and I was greeted by a densely packed bin of dusty cat hair, enough to build a medium sized cat completely out of hair. I was shocked and disgusted at the same time. I showed my wife and she couldn\\'t believe it. The cleaning ladies were not here too long ago. So, two days later it ran again and I checked again, and found a lightly packed bin of dusty cat hair, enough to build a kitten. And each time it runs I find a small kitten worth of hair, which my cats shed between runs. I think of all the dust and hair I am not sucking up while breathing, and I smile, loving the vacuum even more. So, I have a second floor, I loved it so much I bought a second one for the upstairs. I had a similar experience mapping and running the upstairs vacuum.  Cons: The cons are gripes in my setup, not with the product. My house is quite big, and the vacuum downstairs has to recharge before it finishes the last room. My wife and I work from home. I have it start at 6am so it doesn\\'t wake anyone up, but it\\'s not running in the middle of the night. But, by the time it finishes and recharges we are working and sometimes on zoom calls, and it will startup again to run the last room. I just have to tell the app to return to base, or click the pause button on the vacuum, and problem solved. The other \"issue\" was the other night at 4am I woke up to the upstairs vacuum going in my bedroom. I was really confused and shocked, turns out via the app that it was \"manually activated\" and I can only assume by a cat sitting on/walking on the buttons. It would be nice if it could be disabled from running via manual activation, or during set hours, to prevent this. But, it is not a con, really, just a funny/stupid story of my experience of a product that I truly love.  I have become an unofficial spokesman for Shark. I hadn\\'t even known they did robot vacuums before I got mine. If I hadn\\'t seen the amazingly cheap black friday sale I never would have bought it, and I would be missing out. Today I am considering getting a third for my basement. But, really, I just love it so much I want to buy the newest one, and see how much better it does.  If you are on the fence, seriously, just buy it. I have never regretted it. My wife was so pissed when I first got it, she had one of the original bouncing random ones, and assumed this would be similar. She has told me over and over how wrong she was, and how great this is. That makes it worth getting alone. But, I was having bad allergies before I got this, and since then they are all basically gone. Not even the sniffles since then.  I love this shark. The bad reviews for the mapping must have been old software. I have a large and complex floorpan with lots of furniture, cat toys, chairs, etc. I never pre-clean or changed my habits. Once it got a cat toy stuck in the roller that I popped out and removed. Once it got a string wrapped in there, same. That is it. I run it 3x/week, and have had it for months. It is amazing. The people that said it is loud must have a bad unit. It is like 10% the sound of my Dyson vacuum, maybe less. The people that said it doesn\\'t vacuum well, must have a bad unit. Mine beats my full-sized Dyson in what it picks up. My house looks perfectly clean and that Shark will pick up a dusty cat worth of hair from each floor.  Basically, I ran it once and it mapped my house perfectly. I set it to run 3x/week and other than emptying the bagless bin into the trash, I never think about it. My upstairs unit got stuck over the edge of the stairs once, one wheel went over and it asked for help. I set a \"no-go\" area virtually with the app, and it hasn\\'t had an issue since. Other than sucking up a toy mouse and string once, that is the extent of my issues for two Shark vacuums. They have taken so many pounds of cat hair and dust out of my house it is horrifying. I love these things. I don\\'t know if other brands are difference, better or worse. I just know this Shark is amazing. The Lidar mapping is spot on. Works in light and dark, except for really low things it never comes into contact with chairs, or walls. It doesn\\'t scratch things like the ones that bump into stuff.

By contrast, the Roborock Q7 Max+ is a dream (with two exceptions). It mapped our home correctly. It first sweeps the edges in a room before doing the interior parts. It knows where it is and can easily orient itself if you manually place it in a room. It sweeps and mops with a nice, tight pattern that ensures nothing is missed. And it does it's job pretty quickly.  With the Bissell, it would use up almost all it's battery life to sweep our home. With the Roborock, it barely uses any to do the same job. We really like this product and think it's well worth the asking price.  Having said that, there are two things that are keeping this from getting a five star rating from me:  1 - It doesn't mop as well as the Bissell did.  The Bissell had two spinning mop heads that really did a good job of 'scrubbing' the floor as it mopped. This less expensive version of the Roborock only has a pad that it drags across the floor. From what I've read, the more expensive versions vibrate the pad a bit to help with scrubbing. I'd say, overall, that mopping is average. If it had a spinning mop head attachment like the Bissell did, it would be great.  2 - It doesn't detect carpets when in mop mode.  The Q7 knows when it's on a carpet when it vacuums and increases the vacuum to better vacuum rugs. But if you're in mop mode and have a run sitting on your hardwood floor? The Q7 won't know it's there and mop right on it. The higher end models allow you to designate rugs in the app, but you can't do that with this model of Roborock. So, I have to roll up the rug before the Q7 mops. In some ways, this is better as it ensure the floor under the rug always gets cleaned, so I can't complain too much. Even so, it would be nice of the Q7 simply detected the carpet and didn't try to mop it.  But these two things are minor issues when compared to the overall use of the Q7. The app is easy to use. It's nice that you can designate rooms and the general type of flooring each room uses. It's great that you can designate no-go zones and a lot more.

Even with consistent brushing, her hair is always EVERYWHERE and coagulates in corners on the floor and under our couch (which this robot can scoot under). 2) I now am horrified at the realization of how much crap and nastiness accumulates in the floor of a house within 24hrs. I\\'ll never be the same.  The pictures of the dust bin below are from single runs 24hrs apart in our small, carpeted bedroom. EVERY, SINGLE, DAY, this little robot picks up an ENTIRE bin\\'s worth of dust and hair from our bedroom, as well as a full bin from our kitchen and living room which is hardwood. It\\'s actually insane - it\\'s not like we live in a palatial mansion, they\\'re normal sized rooms - and I\\'ll never look at the floors of my house the same ever again.  As far as the robot itself (which I\\'ve affectionately named Ding Dong), it\\'s adorable and does everything it needs to do efficiently and effectively. It\\'s a little louder than I expected it to be, especially when it\\'s running over carpet or when I have the vacuum power turned all the way up, but since I\\'m running this during the day, it\\'s a complete non-issue. This thing could sound like a jet engine in my living room and I would still give it 5 stars because of how well it cleans.  The app is also intuitive and easy to use. I don\\'t like that it requires wifi to work because I\\'m a privacy fiend, so I set it up with an old cellphone on a network that\\'s only used by roborock and other smart home devices. The beta mapping feature works wonderfully; I have my rooms setup and can quickly tell Ding Dong which rooms I want her to clean. The app also has a maintenance category which will keep you informed on when routine tasks should be performed, such as cleaning the brush or replacing a filter, as well as an instruction manual built in to help you through your first days of usage without needing to flip through a booklet. Other appliance app developers should be looking at this one and taking notes.  I should also mention that we got almost $200 off the list price because of the Amazon sale and another coupon I found online, so for me, the price point was great. If I had needed to pay $429 or $499 (current list price), I don\\'t know that this would be five star. I do feel that $500 is a bit overpriced, especially considering the discontinuation of the S4, which is what I was originally intending to purchase. Having a more expensive model (eg, the Max) is all well and good, but the price is a bit more problematic when the original model is no longer available (ESPECIALLY when there is a *visciously competitive* market for used or \"open box\" S4s on resale sites like ebay). I also wish Roborock would change their website to reflect that the S4 is no longer sold; currently, the page for the original S4 links to this listing here for the Max. I find that misleading.  So, overall, since I was able to buy the S4 Max at a steep discount, I\\'m over the moon with this purchase. Ding Dong is a huge time saver, and within the span of a week, she has made a noticable improvement to the air quality in our house... So much so that I\\'m starting to form a belief that access to a robot vacuum should be a universal right.

Amazon had a $40 off discount for early buyers, and so my sales pitch to my wife began. She wasn\\'t wanting to spend the money, but I convinced her that it would allow our house to stay more clean without work from us.  We are on the tail end of a major 7 month (and counting) home remodel job and we put in new hardwood flooring through most of our upstairs as a part of it. That means that any bit of dog or cat fur stands out pretty easily, and my wife is a bit OCD about clean floors. Sounded like a great match, so we jumped in and bought it.  We didn\\'t try it out right away as there were too many known obstacles due to construction, but after a few days, I wanted to try it out. The floors were bare except for some basic furniture, and I blocked off one section of the dining room where there were tools and such as well as the main hallway since some work was being done down there so that the Roborock would just ignore it. Things seemed to go well... for the most part.  It got stuck a few times on the bare floor. That\\'s right. It struggled going over pretty much every floor vent. We have 4 different styles down currently as we decide which one we are going with long term. They are all just barely above the surface and none of them have large gaps. Oh, and the S4 wanted to suicide itself down the stairs. Twice during that first cleaning, it went along the top edge of the stairs, and dropped one wheel over the edge and stopped. I didn\\'t think too much about it because I figured that after it mapped the house, I could just put a no-go line there. I did this test during the day when I was home, but my wife was not. I wanted to work out the bugs before showing it to her.  Fast forward a couple of days. Time to try the cleaning again. Same setup as before, and off it went. It got stuck in all of the same vent spots, but managed not to drop a wheel off of the top of the stair (YAY), and it was pretty cool. We weren\\'t sure what to do about the vent covers though, and after getting stuck on the 6th one, we canceled the vacuum job as we were leaving the house.  Then it happened... We opened up the rest of the floor after tools and construction to the floors was done. Put the rest of the furniture in the house, and put down some rugs.  The Roborock started off and I had high hopes. Now that the whole floor was open and everything was in place, I could finally get the full map of the house to set any no-go lines and areas... My enthusiasm was short lived. Stuck on air vents, ok, we knew that would happen, but then it got stuck under the dining room table. The chair legs are big enough for it to fit through, but it just bounced around under there for a solid 10 minutes before I had to move a chair to let it find its way out. I thought that the S4 was advertised to be smarter than that??? And then it found the first rug... Stuck... Alarm goes off that it is stuck too. It never made it on to the rug, but had bounced around between a rug, a kitchen cabinet, and the refrigerator long enough that it errored out. Hmmm. Maybe I need to just move the rug a couple of inches to give it some room to work. Nope, it couldn\\'t seem to make it on to the rug. Most of the time (like 98% of the time), only one wheel would go up on to the rug, and then it just couldn\\'t get on the rug completely and would wiggle around over and over and not make progress.  I know what you are thinking... Must be thick rugs or shag rugs or something... Nope. These rugs are significantly thinner than a threshold that the Roborock managed to go over, are just normal low pile material, and don\\'t have a pad or anything under them (although we want to add a pad to the main one in the living room at some point). The Roborock just couldn\\'t sort out how to get on to the rugs. The 2% of the time that it did get on a rug, it vacuumed just fine, until it went off the rug and tried to get back on.  Not only could it not get on to the rugs, but all of its wiggling around would cause it to not map the house correctly. It thought that it was in the dining room when it was still in the kitchen. It was taking areas that it already cleaned, and then duplicating that area about 15 feet away on the map because it saw it as a new area, it was skewing a large portion of the map on to a 45 degree angle, which really made it get lost.  At one point, it was cleaning a random spot on the map, and then its laser saw something that made it think that it was somewhere else and it literally just \"jumped\" to the new location.  Again, every time it got stuck, I tried to leave it exactly in place and just lift it up and back down to reset the error and move the obstacle, or move it only an inch or to so that it would be really close to where it thought it was.  Sadly, all of these issues just make it impossible to use. Even if it didn\\'t get stuck and send an alarm for help, it can\\'t map the house correctly, and even if it could do that, it is so noisy when it tries to get on to a rug. We can\\'t run the vacuum at night because this would be too noisy (and it would never finish anyway), and we can\\'t run it during the day because I just don\\'t trust it not to get lost.  Maybe we got a bad unit or damaged unit. It was brand new, and while the Roborock boxes (they double box it which is nice) weren\\'t daamged, Amazon put it into a much larger (more than twice the size needed) box and didn\\'t have many of those air pouches for packaging. The Roborock box was free to bounce around inside the larger box and we know how rough the trip can be from warehouse to home.  A lot of people LOVE this thing, and I know that this isn\\'t the normal case, but it was absolutely terrible experience for us.  I took a number of videos of it getting stuck on the edge of our rugs, and saved screenshots of the swirly motions it took when it encountered the edge of a rug trying to get on to it and how messed up the mapping is.  I\\'ve included one photo with some comments and things marked. Red is where it was getting stuck on rugs and swirling around. This seemed to be the cause of the rest of the problems. Pink is where it was lost enough that it re-mapped areas, duplicating them because it thought that they were new areas. Blue is where it lost total orientation too and skewed a chunk of the house 45* Green is where it suddenly went from one spot and \"transported\" itself across the room. It was not picked up or anything, just jumped. At this point I just canceled the cleaning and boxed it up. Sorry Roborock S4, but it just wasn\\'t meant to be.  Again, good luck to everyone else. This seems to be a great vacuum for a lot of people, and I REALLY wanted to like it, but when it can\\'t even go on to a low pile rug (even though it can vacuum it if it does make it on to the rug), and then it just gets completely lost/disoriented, it just won\\'t work.  PS. Roborock, if you are listening, have someone who speaks English proofread your app. Some words are misspelled... \"Enc current cleanup and reset vacuum power?\" I assume you meant \"End\" and not \"Enc\"?

I'm the veteran of 3 previous robo vacs and this is the first one that actually does what it's product description advertises. I'm sick of vacs that randomly clean, don't respect boundaries and don't clean very well.  1. It does very well near stairwells. I have an open stairwell on my main floor going to the lower level and 2 previous vacs have made s swan dive down the stairs or through the opening to the floor below - one just ignored the boundary strips and went right over. This guy went up to the stair opening, paused, and backed off - every time I've run it and I've kept a close eye on it when it gets near the stairs. Its cliff sensors really work. I've now drawn walls and a no-go zone as added insurance but I feel pretty good about it not making the Thelma and Louise dive the previous 2 did.  2. It's a quality vac. It just feels more sturdy and the brushes are rubber and don't seem to tangle as much. Also, you can wash out the filter - this is a real bonus cause those suckers cost a bundle. They suggest that you do clean it and rinse it between uses.  3. I love the mapping. Once you run it for the first time, it creates a map in the Roborock app and you can then create no-go zones or virtual walls. You can also send it to just one room or area to clean. I just tried that out and had it go to the furthest room from it's base and it made beeline right to the room, cleaned and returned to the dock.  4 It is efficient and I love, love, love the lines it leaves in my carpeted spare room - something I never achieve when I vacuum.  5. I previously ordered a Roborock 5 last year but returned it when I couldn't hook it up to the internet - but that was my error. I didn't realize my phone wouldn't automatically pick out the right band - this only connects to 2.4gh, not 5. It's easy to connect and the app is easy to understand. Also, there are a couple really good tutorials on YouTube to show you how to use the app features that I found helpful  I figured out that I had to change the wifi connection to 2.4 on my phone with the Amarey I ordered to replace the Roborock I returned - Amarey is one of the vacs that took a swan dive and now only runs in circles or one corner of the room. Anyway, I got so frustrated with that piece of crap I started looking again and saw they had redesigned the Roborock 4 to work without mopping (I didn't want mopping) at a much cheaper price than the 5 or 6 models. Actually, I'm glad it turned out that way because I love this guy so much. It is exactly what I envisioned when I found I wanted a robot vac.  One thing - make sure to clear your floors and move chairs in your kitchen or dining room the first time you run the vac while it's making it's initial map. That way it gets a clear vision of your floor plan. You won't have to do it every time afterwards. Also, I have a dark bathroom with no windows and it mapped it but didn't clean it the first time I ran it so I turned on the light the next time and it went right in and has gone in since.

Roborock doesn\\'t have any issues with this. I\\'m sure if it had the moping attachment it would. We have Dark sealed laminate in bed rooms and hallways. The S4 does just fine on low pile area rugs and foam bath mats. Even cleans the 2x4 ridged entry rug by the back door just fine. Has lots of power. I run in balanced mode and it does pick most things up out of the tile gaps. We live in Texas so we get alot of dry grass and sandy dirt tracked in. Corner cleaning is okay and it does just fine under furniture that it will fit under. Around of 4 inch clearance is needed. My bed is 3.4 inches and it will not go under there. The noise level is just fine in balaced its just a little louder than the microwave. In silent it\\'s a little quieter than the microwave but lacks a little power on silent mode doesn\\'t pick up small sandy debris from tile gaps. Navigation and mapping are very nice and work well.

I did bump a star for poor Alexa integration and lacking a few other features. You can\\'t tell Alexa to \"ask roborock to clean\" or \"ask roborock to clean the kitchen\" nor can you add it to routines where you say \"Alexa Good morning\" and she tells you the weather turns on the lights and starts the vaccuum.

Only commands I\\'ve been able to get to work but it is only a whole map clean. You also can\\'t label rooms in the roborock app. The maintenance features that tell you when to change clean ir replace items is great. I really like the lidar navigation system and not needing lights to navigate well. I really wish Roborock had a self empty bin. The bin size is fine but I do have to empty it every run or every other. If you have long hair dogs that are heavy shredders like sheperd or husky this may be an issue. The S4 does just fine with short hair. I do how ever need to clean small amounts of my foot long hair out of the brush roll about once a week.

I was in the market for a new vacuum, and I did quite a bit of research. As previously mentioned, I have 2 other robot vacuums (Xiomi which is now Roborock and a Shark AI), plus a cordless as well as upright vacuum (both Dyson). Therefore one should assume I\\'m not a newbie when it comes to that. The specs/features I focused on my research were mostly suction power, battery life and of course, the convenience of auto-emptying.  This vacuum is certainly on the expensive side, but considering the advertised features I thought I would give it a shot. The suction power is almost double than average, has an auto-empty function and mop (which I wasn\\'t too interested based on previous experience). I bought it on November 2022, so I have I\\'ve been using for about 6 months.  I was over the moon when I just received it. The suction power is much higher than the other 2 I have, and the results were somewhat justifying the price and how loud the max power setting is. The battery was pretty good, and the auto-empty was a dream coming true. Unfortunately it did not last long. Everything worked great for about a month or so, and it seems like as soon as I replaced the vacuum bag it stopped working as expecting - and while one might say it is the bag, I\\'ve replaced 3 times even though they were not even half full but it didn\\'t solve the problem.  First I had some blockages on the plastic channel underneath, which despite the disassembly inconvenience was an easy fix. ***Designers, please consider using screws or other mechanisms that don\\'t require the use of tools in areas that need customer maintenance and disassembly.***  Soon after I realized that despite the suction to empty the bin, the dirt gets stuck and it doesn\\'t go through. I understand that a large opening might require more suction power, but the current opening seem to be small enough to where the dirt stays in the bin. I want to mentioned again that I have dogs, therefore most of the dirt in the bin is dog hair. I think the vacuum works good for light cleaning, but it does not perform as expected for a household with pets.  The mopping feature is pretty useless as it doesn\\'t dispense enough water to actually mop anything. I\\'ve tried wetting the mopping pad prior to see if it helped but it didn\\'t. I\\'m not too disappointed as this was not a selling point to me as my other vacuum mops equally as bad, so this was not a selling point to me, just an added feature that I was not counting on.  The battery was good but it seems to be degrading fast, and lately the vacuum has been \"repositioning\" way more than used to be.  Pros: -I like the software and features available, especially the mapping and ability to customize as needed. -Pretty decent power suction  Cons: -Auto-empty is not robust -Battery degrading fast -Very loud on max suction setting -Mop doesn\\'t work  Overall I think the vacuum is ok, but the fact that it is not emptying as it should defeats the purpose and the higher price.

Over that time, though, the company has released several firmware updates that really do seem to have fixed most of its issues. Its pathfinding *without* a saved map is much improved, for example - I did have to delete my saved map at one point (it was my fault) and when I set it loose to create a new map, it only took marginally more time to clean my whole house and create a new map than when it had a saved map to go on. Its work on rugs is also improved; it\\'s still not the greatest in that area, but it\\'s much better at immediately recognizing that a certain angle it\\'s taking isn\\'t working and trying something else. It can get through all of my rugs now... not quickly, but without getting stuck or taking a totally random route through them.  In fact, it generally almost never gets stuck anymore unless I mistakenly leave a cord lying on the floor and it gets twisted up in it. (This is a problem all robot vacs seem to have; I feel like there should be some way to avoid this, because how can you ever have *no* cords on the floor? We all have lamps, air purifiers, TV\\'s, stereos, etc.) It\\'s become smart enough through its newer firmwares to recognize furniture it\\'s not going to fit under or areas it\\'s too small to get into or out of. It\\'s also better at getting out of areas it might have previously gotten stuck in, if it does happen into a place it probably shouldn\\'t go. And it\\'s a lot better at figuring out when a tapered or contoured object\\'s actually an obstacle that it can\\'t get around (it no longer tries to climb my speaker stands or bar stools for 15 minutes each, which each have tapered bases).  So at this point I\\'m pretty happy as long as it keeps working. The current version of this vacuum on this page looks different than the one I bought, so I can\\'t say if it works the same. And I still can\\'t give it 5 stars because it\\'s still not perfect and will probably just never be *great* on rugs. But it\\'s better than it used to be. If my previous review score was really like a 3.6, the new one would be more like a 4.4. Both rounded to 4, but it\\'s definitely improved.  Original review is below. -------------------------------  I have an 1800 square foot ranch style (single level) house. The floors in common areas are stone, which if you\\'re not familiar is really just like tile. It\\'s totally flat and hard. For comfort and acoustics we have a couple of rugs in these areas. These aren\\'t shag rugs or anything, just regular rugs, albeit with an uneven texture (ie. the design has no pile at all in some parts). Our bedrooms are fully carpeted.  I bought this model because it was the cheapest I could find with laser navigation and real AI pathfinding, and the reviews I\\'d seen had said it works on carpet, rugs and flat tile floors. Some reviews said rugs had been a problem but that it was fixed in a firmware update. So I took a chance on a brand I didn\\'t have any previous experience with. (I now know it\\'s really Xiaomi, same folks who make cell phones under that brand.)  When I got it, I followed all the instructions and first installed the Roborock app on my phone (which it tells you to do) and then later the MiHome app (which it doesn\\'t explicitly say to do, but only the MiHome app has some of the features referenced in the manual). I immediately updated the firmware. Then I let it loose.  The first run through the house was kind of a disaster! I had expected it to have to figure out where everything was and consequently take a little extra time, but it only made it through about 1/3 of my house because it kept getting stuck on my area rugs and trying to figure out ways up onto them (which it never did). It also kept trying to climb up my bar stools and speaker stands like a dog humping someone\\'s leg. This would have been comical if it wasn\\'t so annoying. It just never figured out that there was an obstacle there. In the end it died before it even made it back to the dock and it didn\\'t come close to fully vacuuming my house.  Since it never made it through the house, that also meant the map wasn\\'t saved and I couldn\\'t even mark off \"no-go\" areas. So I had to just let it try again. The second and third times, I tried as hard as I could do make things easy for it, by removing *any* obstacles (including my stools and speaker stands) and by making my house \"smaller\" by closing lots of doors and blocking off any under-furniture areas (it also has a tendency to get stuck under my TV stand). That at least allowed it to finish mapping and save it, and then I could mark off no-go zones in the app. It\\'s taken me about 3 weeks of trial and error, but I\\'ve now finally gotten it to the point that it\\'s avoiding stuff it should be avoiding and cleaning the rest of my house properly.  And generally, it\\'s doing that pretty well now that it\\'s set up. The laser mapping is quite accurate and the AI is such that it\\'ll go around the edges first, then go back and do an efficient grid-based pattern over the inner sections of each room. Now that I have everything running reasonably well, it usually finishes my 1800 square foot house in about 90 minutes with about 50% of battery remaining. And I mean, in the areas it cleans, that\\'s really finished - it\\'s not just doing a random pattern and missing a bunch of stuff.  BUT. And this is a big \"but\". Among the no-go zones I\\'ve had to mark are my area rugs. It just can\\'t deal with them. Actually, one it sort of can and I\\'ve had to allow it a small path through on it to get to an area of hard floor that needs to be done. But it takes like 20 minutes just to get through that. The other rug it can\\'t handle at all. And again, these are not high-pile rugs; they\\'re just a little irregular, but I\\'m 100% confident that there are other robot vacuums out there that would tackle them with no problem. This is a big disappointment, and I almost returned the vacuum over it - I still need to manually vacuum these rugs.  Even low-pile wall to wall carpet it\\'s not all that happy with. The vacuum motor noticeably slows down, as does the wheel motor. It sounds like it\\'s straining.  I actually emailed Roborock support over this, and they flat out told me this vacuum is only intended for hard floors. And that\\'s not what it says right here on Amazon; it says low pile carpets are among its \"optimal\" uses.  I\\'m giving it four stars because I still don\\'t think you can find a cheaper option with laser mapping and app-based control. And that\\'s really cool, and not something I would want to be without. As long as it takes this thing to finish with its efficient patterns, I can\\'t even imagine trying to get the house properly clean with a random pattern vacuum. But I\\'m definitely taking off a star because it really requires a lot of babying to get set up right - it\\'s like trying to housebreak a pet - and because it just does not work on area rugs, and it works only somewhat well on carpet.', 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': 44, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Jeff'}}, {'title': \"Best Robot I've Ever Tried\", 'body': \"Okay, yes it's the only robot vacumm I've ever had so far, but this has already sold me on always buying Roborocks in the future!

My friend just stopped using his iRobot ones because he got tired of them always getting stuck.

Emptying the dustbin and cleaning the brushes is pretty easy too. Much better than having to lug out the big vacuum cleaner. For regular cleaning, it works great.

I got the ROPVACNIC Robot Vacuum Cleaner and Mop Combo (S1) because I already have the ROPVACNIC Robot Vacuum (A1), which I really like, and I was interested to see how they could combine that with a mopping feature. In my opinion, they've done a great job. The S1 is easy to assemble; just two vacuum brushes, the mop pad, and a 2-in-1 water/dust bin, all of which just snap in place. When operating the S1, you really can vacuum and mop at the same time! The mop pad is thin, but it cleans flooring well. I can't speak to tiles because I don't have any. It also cleaned my area rug in the dining room without any problem. If you get the ROPVACNIC app downloaded and working, you can adjust the suction and control the water flow in the settings. The S1 is much quieter than other robot vacuums I've tried, and it runs almost twice as long on this battery. Maintenance is fairly easy too. Unlike the old standard upright vacuums, there is very little hair to remove from the brushes and wheels. Brushes quickly and easily snap on and off so you can clean them and the dust bin just opens to empty. No dirty bags or hoses to deal with. A couple things to note: I've noticed that when the vacuum dust bin is starting to get full, the vacuum leaves little clumps of dust and hair on the carpet. To be fair, we have two golden retrievers and are in the middle of the hottest summer ever, so they are shedding a lot of hair for the vacuum to deal with. If I have to pick up a few clumps, I'm ok with that. Another is the App Instructions. I struggled a bit with them and I think they aren't quite correct or complete. When it mentions the WiFi symbol on the vacuum should turn to a flashing or steady green, that is incorrect. The light is BLUE as can be seen in the attached photo. But the main issue I had was getting the WiFi to connect. I have an android phone and what I ended up doing was changing the Permissions for Location of nearby devices in the App settings. Then it finally found the S1 signal. You could probably get by without the app. The remote control offers most of the important functions. I quite often just put it on AUTO and let it do it's thing.

I like that this model does not get stuck on objects too easily (we have a lot lying around to get stuck on!) or suck up things it should not. The app is really handy - I love being able to locate the robot (when it is stuck on a foreign object - ribbons, strings, etc - you can \"beep\" it) and knowing what the problem is (it tells you which wheel is stuck or whatever the problem is) for an easy find and fix and send on its way. The remote is also fun for the kids to use and guide the robot. Since this model also has mopping (we have the plain vacuum also and love it) it has a smaller capacity for both the dirt and the water (it has to share space) so it requires more frequent emptying and refilling. When it mops, it makes tiles surfaces slippery (of course) so you have to strategically plan when to run the mop feature with little kids, or they\\'ll slip and fall. Therefore, what I love (about both models) is that you can schedule clean! And you can schedule multiple times!! So I have vacuums going often throughout the day and can plan wisely (like mop at bedtime - no slipping) or run white noise at nap time (not during play time - hitting the children\\'s buildings), etc. I also love that it self-charges!! In terms of mopping, it does well for a robot vacuum -- do not expect to stop manually mopping. It will help get sand and sticky and dust, but it cannot pick up stains that are hardened (which require a little foot action with a regular mop!). Other bonuses are adjustable suction level and water level (you can \"close\" off water entirely if you want to).

The app is intuitive and user-friendly, allowing me to schedule cleanings, set cleaning modes, and even monitor the vacuum's progress. It's a great feature that adds to the overall ease of use. No Need for Walls to Set Borders: In the past, my old robot vacuum needed physical walls or barriers to define cleaning zones. This new model doesn't require any of that. It uses advanced sensors to navigate and avoid obstacles, which makes it much easier to use. I can just set it and forget it, knowing it will clean the entire room without getting stuck or wandering into off-limits areas. Works on Carpet and Hardwood Floors: Another big plus is that this robot vacuum and mop combo works seamlessly on both carpet and hardwood floors. It transitions smoothly between different surfaces without missing a beat. The mop function is a nice touch, and it does a great job of keeping my hardwood floors clean and shiny. Easy to Use and Control: Overall, this robot vacuum is incredibly easy to use. Setting it up was a breeze, and I was able to start cleaning within minutes.

I have a Neato D6 vacuum for all the downstairs common areas in the house. After about 2 years, it became one headache after another. It\\'s now 5 years old, and I hardly ever wake up to find it hasn\\'t gotten stuck somewhere on something. So that\\'s the baseline for my expectations.  2. This Tikom vacuum cleaner was purchased just to clean a much smaller, and somewhat maze-like part of the house which gets dirty fast and which is inaccessible to the household Neato vacuum.  Considering the Neato was literally 6x the cost of this Tikom unit, my expectations were low here, but so were my requirements, so I thought it worth giving it a go. It\\'s now been running twice a day for about a week and I am honestly really quite impressed. Of course, we\\'ll see whether it holds up in the long run.  POINTS OF INTEREST:  Here are some points of interest I\\'ve observed:  - In the context of this small, albeit labyrinthian space, it has never gotten stuck on anything and it\\'s never dropped below 80% battery life.  - It\\'s surprisingly quiet. Like, I actually do think you could run this in a bedroom while you sleep, provided you\\'re a somewhat heavy sleeper and perhaps you\\'re used to droning noises (e.g., fans, AC units).  - The suction is good, but I doubt this would face real heavy-duty cleaning tasks. However, since it\\'s running twice a day, the conditions never reach the point of \"heavy duty\".  - Like the last point, the mopping functionality is referred to kind of generously. This isn\\'t really \"mopping\" anything. It\\'s just dragging a damp rag across the ground. But, here\\'s the thing, in practice, if you start with a clean floor, this thing helps it stay that way a lot longer. It\\'s not going to clean up a real mess, but if you keep the reservoir full and replace the pad every day or so, it all but halts the creep of grime build up, and that is honestly not even something I knew I wanted and it\\'s great.  - The brush is only about 50% the width of the robot, and I thought that would be a problem, but it doesn\\'t appear to be at all in practice. I have a dog that is hell bent on leaving fur everywhere and this thing never leaves any of it behind.  DRAWBACKS:  Okay, now there are some drawbacks that I think are worth mentioning. Personally, none of these have been a serious problem for me in my context, but I can imagine if you expected this thing to clean a whole house, you\\'d quickly bump into the negatives.  - The dust bin is really quite small. In the roughly 160 square feet of space my robot has to clean, the dust bin needs emptying about once a day. I forgot once and it was jam packed the following afternoon. I don\\'t think it would be capable of tackling the almost 1000 square feet of space in the main house without being emptied half way through.  - The water reservoir is really very small. You can set the water flow for the mop feature in the settings of the app, but anything less than \"high flow\" doesn\\'t seem to make the pad wet enough to do much. With my robot running twice a day (two passes in the morning, and one in the evening) the reservoir needs filling daily. Again, it would be empty well before it got through the whole main floor of the house.  - The app is surprisingly good, but also disappointing in its limitations. For example, you can set up a schedule, but you cannot define specifics about what it should do on that schedule. You cannot have it vacuum on high in the morning, and low overnight. You cannot have it mop with a high flow at night, and vacuum with a low flow mop in the morning. All of the settings for how the device should run are set at the device level, and the schedule only defines when it should run, not how it should run.  - Removing the dust bin is easy, but putting it back in is a little frustrating. It clicks in really easily and satisfyingly once you get the alignment right, but getting the alignment right is kind of tedious for some reason. Not a big deal, but could be better.  CONCLUSION:  I would say for a small, medium traffic space, this is a surprisingly good device and at about $150 I wouldn\\'t hesitate. Yes, it does require regular maintenance in the form of replacing the pad, emptying the bin, and refilling the reservoir pretty much daily, but in exchange for that less than 90 seconds of effort, the floor basically stays spotless without any other intervention and I would call that more than worth the money and effort.', 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': 4, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Will'}}, {'title': 'Tikom L8000 Robot Vacuum: Cleans Quietly, Picks Up Almost Everything', 'body': 'The Tikom L8000 Robot Vacuum has been a part of my cleaning routine for the past few weeks, and it has left me quite impressed with its cleaning prowess. The vacuum boasts of a strong suction power that effortlessly picks up everything from pet hair and dust to crumbs and cereal. The result is a noticeable difference in the cleanliness of my carpets. One of the standout features of the Tikom L8000 is its quiet operation. At just 45 decibels, it’s significantly quieter than my previous vacuum. This allows me to have it running even while I’m engrossed in my favorite TV show, without any disruption. The vacuum’s LiDAR navigation is another feature worth mentioning. It efficiently maps out my home and cleans in neat rows, navigating around furniture with ease and without getting stuck. The Tikom L8000 is particularly useful for my two-story house, thanks to its ability to store up to five maps. This means I can set it to clean different floors without the hassle of re-mapping. The vacuum also offers the convenience of No-Go Zones and Virtual Walls. These features have been a lifesaver, allowing me to create zones around my pet bowls and certain furniture that I prefer the vacuum to steer clear of. The virtual walls are also handy for blocking off doorways to rooms that I don’t want cleaned. The vacuum’s long runtime is another plus. The battery lasts for up to 150 minutes on a single charge, which is sufficient to clean my entire house. When the battery runs low, the vacuum automatically returns to the dock to recharge. In conclusion, the Tikom L8000 is a powerful, quiet, and efficient vacuum cleaner that significantly reduces the hassle of keeping my floors clean.

It\\'s a pretty good robot, but I do miss some of the features of the Lefant.  The best thing about this robot is that it DOES have a FUNCTIONAL mapping system. Most of the robots in this price range don\\'t seem to have a reliable mapping system, but this one absolutely does. I absolutely recommend downloading the app so you can view the map as well as edit it--you are able to mark \"no-go zones\", or places you don\\'t want the robot to go, as well as virtual walls. I used this to mark off rooms in my apartment that haven\\'t been unpacked yet (and are too crowded for the robot to effectively go), as well as to mark off the stairs so it doesn\\'t take a tumble and keep it from running into the pets\\' food bowls. It will automatically differentiate rooms from one another, but you can further segment the rooms if you\\'d like (my living/dining is open concept, so I manually separated them from each other). You can direct the robot to clean specific rooms or to \"spot clean\" an area, perfect for people with pets. You can also observe the robot\\'s path through the rooms--it takes a very regimented route to ensure it hits every spot.  My primary issue with this robot is that my Lefant actually did a better job of picking stuff up from the floor and was easier to clean. Although the Tikom has customizable suction and pathing AI (the Lefant just sort of bumped around in random directions), the actual hardware design is inferior. It only has one sweeper brush (the three-pronged brush that sweeps debris into the vacuum) instead of two, presumably to make space for mopping features, which reduces the vacuum\\'s range. It also uses a traditional roller brush on the underside, which catches all sorts of hair and eventually gets clogged up but doesn\\'t seem to do much to capture debris. The Lefant did not have this and actually seemed better off for it--the Lefant still vacuumed up human and pet hair, but more of it ended up in the canister than on the brushes.  Some other things to note are that it struggles sometimes to return to the charging dock--notably if the dock is crooked or if there\\'s an obstacle (in my case, usually a cat) in the way. However it\\'s easy to just plop the robot back onto the dock yourself (or push it with your foot). The robot talks (it will announce when it is starting/finishing charging, when the dust bin is removed/inserted, etcetera.

I am really impressed with this vacuum. It has saved me so much time and energy in the evenings when I am pressed for time. Like many professional moms, I have a toddler and dinner time can get a little messy on the floor. Even with the floor mat to catch food from the highchair, she can still sometimes make a mess. Prior to getting this robot vacuum, I would skip dinner and spend most of my time in the evenings rushing to clean bottles and make just to make sure I had enough time to get the floors cleaned before I had to take my toddler upstairs for a bath time. Now I don’t worry about it. Unless there’s a major spill, I just clean off the counters, get the dishwasher loaded make lunch and bottles and grab my toddler for our night routine. Ita a relief to know that my vacuum is programmed to run every night when no one is downstairs and won’t be disturbed. I particularly like this model because of the self/emptying feature which also saves me time. Because I have horrible allergies, I also hated dumping my other vacuum. No matter how little dust there was, I still managed to get some sniffles afterwards. Now I don’t worry about that because I don’t have to change the bag for about seven weeks.  Also, other than unboxing the item, plugging in the base and charging the vacuum, there was essentially no physical setup involved. I simply downloaded the app, powered it on and just like that it mapped my entire floor. It was a super simple process. The app is pretty intuitive. I did notice once that a couple of my settings weren’t saved, but it’s literally a tap of a button. I also have it set so that it does not use the strongest suction setting or self-empty late at night after it vacuums because that can be a little noisy & I dare NOT wake my baby! But even if it were to self-empty at night, it literally takes about eight seconds.  When I come down in the mornings, my floor is super clean- particularly when I use the mop and vacuum function. It doesn’t deep clean, but I usually don’t have to mop my floors outside of the robot except every 10 days. It also has an edge clean setting which I love because it actually works very well. I will say that I noticed it making a little bit of a squeaking noise almost as if the wheels or something were dry, but it isn’t very loud and the vacuum is working perfect so I don’t know if it’s just a kink or something else, but I don’t think so. I will also note that it is super easy to fill the water pan and also very easy to pop out the brushes if something gets stuck in them. Other than a few strands of hair, I haven’t had anything to get stuck yet.  Do not hesitate, go get this vacuum. I also got it when it was on sale so I am particularly happy with my purchase.

It\\'s only 2 weeks in, so I can\\'t speak to longevity yet, but so far, this seems like an excellent buy. My old vac stopped working after 3 years (Tesvor), and although I quite liked it, I wanted to try a different brand because their customer service was so terrible/absent. I then ordered a Vipsun brand but it was pretty deficient, had to send it back. This one is the goldilocks one. One major factor was the LiDAR (its ability to map a room based on \"sight\", which is highly accurate. WAY better than other vacs which bump their way around and have to touch everything to know where stuff is). I was confused at first that it didn\\'t come with a remote control. But that\\'s because your phone is the remote. You probably won\\'t need it after initial setup anyway. You\\'ll want to download the app and connect the device to wifi right away, otherwise it won\\'t be able to intelligently map your home--once connected it will do the mapping on its first clean. That will then reduce the cleaning time and lead to better efficiency on all future cleans. Once it goes around all your rooms and \"eyeballs\" them, it will go back and do a more or less up-and-down path through each room (the way you\\'d mow a lawn). It navigated obstacles overall very well--dining table legs, etc. The only place it got caught was under a kitchen island that was just a tiny bit too tight \"ceilinged\", and one lamp base. Otherwise in 75 sq m, it performed perfectly, and got almost every cranny. We\\'re planning to put small risers under the kitchen island but you can easily mark it as a \"no go\" area on your map. I REALLY liked the map functionality. I was surprised at how accurate it was, it got an excellent floorplan of all the rooms. Via the app, you\\'re able to do all sorts of smart things. For example, our kitchen is the really high traffic area, needs way more attention than rest of house. Within seconds I was able to program it to clean the kitchen on \"high suction\" mode every weekday morning, and then do a whole house medium suction clean every Friday. You can customise suction mode for each room (for example if you have a thick pile carpet in one room). You can also customise room order for multi-room cleans. For example, I work from home and wanted it to clean my office last in its rotation, so I programmed the whole-house clean to do all over the side that\\'s furthest from me first, to be least disturbing, and then come do my office at the end of its cycle. Suction power seems good, it picks up a lot on each cycle; it has a decent sized capacity so it doesn\\'t get full too fast (though if doing whole house I think really it needs to be emptied after one cycle). It does have a roller brush which I know some people are for and some against (it takes a minute more to clean), but definitely wasn\\'t a dealbreaker to me and I felt it enabled a more thorough clean. Setup minimal, came almost fully charged so was able to get it going right away. It allows you to set the voice to English or German but not to change the voice. Pet peeve: it bugs me how all the \"servant robot\" voices are female and I wish I could change it to a more gender neutral voice, but so be it!

The setup was straightforward. I struggled slightly connecting it to the Wi-Fi, but really nothing. On the first run, it ran thru the complete area and swept as it was going. I thought it was just going to scout the area, but not clean. That took about under an hour. The second time, I installed the mop, which is something similar to a 'swifter'. The process went very smoothly. It can be tracked on the app and we're delighted to see the neat rows as it covers every spot, without missing anything. Sometimes it seems to forget a small area only to come back before going to another room and finish it off. What a difference with 'Gertrude', our previous robot, that had no pattern whatsoever and just moved about for a while in each room. 'Dolores ' as we call the Tikom, is a joy to watch and follow on the app. All went well for about a month. Everything went out the door all of a sudden. We thought 'Gertrude' had invaded Dolores' soul. Everything was attempted, wipe out the map, reset the WiFi, and finally reset it. So we had to restart from scratch. Then we had Dolores back. All smooth. A month after that, guess what: the ghost of Gertrude came back. Very erratic moves. No pattern whatsoever. What are we going to do. We can't have a possessed Dolores, and we can't defibrillate her once a month either. That would be unrobotlike behavior. What would the robot community think of us. We tried to reach out to Amazon, but that was a joke. They called and after explaining the issue we were put on hold for over 35 minutes, at which time the 'hang up'button was pressed. They could've called back, they had the number but never heard back from them. A swift search on the Internet, found the web page for Tikom; a message was left explaining the problem. By next morning a reply was waiting on the inbox, with explanations on information to furnish to them. That went back to Tikom right back and by the following morning (they are in Shanghai, so about 12 hours time difference), we received notice that a firmware update was waiting on the app. It was downloaded and Dolores became herself again. I believe/hope the exorcism, is permanent. Great kudos for Tikom customer service. It is number 1. Recommended highly. Now, coming from the lady that is a cleaning nazi (hope she doesn't read this), Dolores does a great job. Being a cleaning extremist, she mops the complete area, right after Dolores has finished and the tub water is sparkling clean when she's finished. So there. Now Dolores does NOT have the ability to detect foreign objects along her way (socks, shoes, toys, etc), so she will move those objects or get tangled. We lost a door stop for about a week; finally found it behind the bed in the corner by the night stand. She also needs to find her bearings when she starts and ends.

The order was received in a timely manner. In preparation for the new vacuum system, I thoroughly vacuumed and shampooed the rug which is about 10 years old and has a normal pile.  After the Roomba mapped my house, I started a cleaning mission of the living room. After 2.5 minutes of operation the unit stopped and announced an Error 2 – Clean the Green Rollers message. I turned the unit over and could not see any obstruction in or around the green rollers. I reassembled the rollers and reactivated the J9+ back into the cleaning mission. Only 1.5 minutes later, Error 2 again announced itself! There was no obstruction.  Error 2 occurred again after 3.9 minutes of cleaning, then 2.0 minutes, then 1.7 minutes, then 4.6 minutes, then1.5 minutes, then 3.7 minutes, then 1.9 minutes, then 1.5 minutes, then 2.2 minutes, then 3.9 minutes, then 2.0 minutes, then 6.3 minutes, then 2.3 minutes of cleaning. At that point I gave up and ended the cleaning mission. The J9+ operated for a total of 66 minutes during this cleaning evolution and experienced 15 Error 2 events!  At that point, I went back online to Amazon and requested a return on May 22, 2024, which was approved.  [NOTE: I am a licensed Aircraft Mechanic and a Certified Biomedical Equipment Technician. I know and understand technology and troubleshooting.]  Foolishly, hoping the issue I experienced was a one-off failure of a J9+. I ordered another J9+ via Amazon. That order was placed on May 22, 2024, the same day I returned the original J9+.  The new, replacement J9+ arrived on May 29, 2024, and the following day [today] May 30, 2024, I installed it.  A room survey was first completed and then I initiated a cleaning mission of the living room. Within 3 minutes, the new J9+ stopped cleaning and announced an Error 2 – clean the green rollers fault. As before with the original J9+, there was no obstruction present. The cleaning mission was reactivated. As before, multiple times after very short periods of time, Error 2 was experienced.  No Error 2 when operating without the green roller brushes and no Error 2 with the green brushes installed and cleaning on a hard surface.  I note again that the carpet is a normal pile carpet that is 10 years old. It was shampooed about 10 days ago and thoroughly vacuumed before testing the Roomba.  I have again started a return of the second J9+. If iRobot cannot resolve this wholly unacceptable problem, I will follow through with the return.

I have not had it long enough to comment on all of the features such as Dirt Detective but there are a few things I can comment on. I feel it could use stronger suction. I’m using it on hardwood floors and I want it to get stray cat litter. It picks up most cat litter but a lot of granules get left behind in the roller chamber. Also when the Roomba docks and attempts to empty itself it never fully gets all the litter out of the dust bin in the Roomba.

The setup was super easy as long as one is comfortable using your phone\\'s app to handle all the tasks. The initial mapping was very cool to watch. If you\\'re a tech nerd, you\\'ll love trying to figure out how the algorithms are working to navigate the furniture, walls, entry ways, etc. In about 40 minutes R2D2 mapped out my first floor very accurately and was able to work it\\'s way around the jungle of chair legs at the dining room table. It took a while, but it managed! After the initial mapping run, it went right back to it\\'s base and started charging automatically. Next was the actual vacuum run, but before that we decided to put a \"no fly zone\" around the Christmas tree and blanket around it. The app easily let me set up a 5x4 square which I placed in the map of the house - which was very cool, and pressed the \"Vacuum Everything\" button on my app. It was remarkable how R2D2 started in the room with the most dog hair and then proceeded to follow it\\'s map throughout the house. The suction on the wood floors was excellent, and I was impressed when it rolled over the few throw rungs we have, I could hear it kick into a higher gear because it recognized the carpet. Our black lab leaves plenty of hair around on our light colored floors which made it easier to see that R2D2 was doing a great job. During the first mapping, I kept all the bedroom doors closed off the main hall. While it did the first vacuum I forgot the master bedroom door was open. It noticed the new opening, but did not enter the room. I took this as a new mapping run I would need to perform, but I was amazed when it completed the entire house, paused in the living room for about 10 seconds, and then proceeded back to the new opening it discovered previously. It recalled it found a new opening but did not disrupts it\\'s current task - it finished and then returned back. We\\'ve only run it two times, but already we discovered that it remembered the master badroom, added it to the routine and completed the room before returning back to base. It also updated the map in the app and asked me about the new room and what to name it. I was also able to place the new boundaries for the entrance to the bedroom and master bath (which it also found while exploring). The app also shows pictures of obstacles R2D2 came in contact with during it\\'s journey. A wire under the curio cabinet was captured in a crystal clear picture taken by R2D2 and sent to the app for me to decide whether this should be considered a permanent obstacle, or something which I could remove and it could continue working in this space next time. I simply moved the wire closer to the wall, let the app know it was taken care of, and we\\'ll see how R2 does with it next time. I love this robot... I am super impressed by the effectiveness of the vacuum, the ease of the app, and how simple it was to set up.

It cleans better than my previous 2 vacuums. It takes a bit longer than previous ones but that is not so important. Sometimes I wonder why it is moving as it does seems strange but it gets the job done. My only complaint at this early stage is the cost of the filter within the robot itself. That needs to be kept clean or strange things happen. I wish this filter was reuseable like on my previous vacuums. I have a lot of fine dust in the winter because of my wood burning fireplace which needs to be cleaned daily in the winter and this creates fine dust which fills the robot vacuum filter to the point that I find it best to use the main house vacuum to clean this filter daily.

Yes of courses we all know you still have to do some slight cleaning by yourselves because the robot cannot get into tight corners and what not but I would say that it does a very thorough job. Now there are different settings on it like the suction, so it is noticeably quieter when you have it set the lower suction setting, but the higher suction setting actually vacuums better. But then at the same time sacrificing battery life. I prefer to use the higher setting because the robot will go back home and recharge and the cleaning once it’s charged and keep doing that until it’s finished with the entire floor of your house. This works fabulous especially if you have pets. This model is designed for that. So you can say “hasta la vista” to dirt.

I have a miniature husky that sheds all year long. The i8+ did a half decent job of keeping up (Daily job for the first floor) but, over time the vacuum seemed to pickup less. So, in came the j9+. The j9+ has incredible suction, maybe 50% more than the i8+. I moved my i8+ down to my finished basement and runs every other day and has a lot less fur buildup down there.  Now the cons of the j9+. It's dumb, very dumb. Since this model uses a camera, it will take picture of potential obstacles as the job runs. After the job, you have to review the images and specify if it's a temp. obstacle, not an obstacle or you don't know. Well, for about 3 months straight it would take the same picture of a power strip with many cords going to it. The problem is, that this power strip sits between my bedroom wall and nightstand, with about 7 inches from wall to stand. The robot can't even get to it and yet it flags it as an obstacle, even though every time I review , I choose NOT an obstacle and ignore.  The other issue with the camera, is that every now and then a single strand of my dogs fur will get stuck on it and cause the job to error out or lose it's sense of direction.  The final complaint is the is the lack of intelligence when the job needs to pause and re-charge. It's not smart enough to go back and charge up enough to finish the job and will take multiple re-charge trips back and forth before the job is done. My i8+ was always smart enough to know how much to charge to finish the job and no back and forth.  My last comment is about iRobot as a company, it seems their software development is only on the combo models and the j9+ has not received any software updates since I bought it November 2023. The i8+ also has not received any updates since November. Now the Amazon is not buying them, I have a feeling their budget for continuing improvements will only get worse.

You can also setup no-go zones in the app which have helped out with some of the issues we've had with getting hung up. It also does a better job or cleaning these runners we have in front of our doors more than our full size vac. The full size likes to just suck it up into the brushes but with the Roomba this doesn't happen. I have noticed that it will struggle with sucking up larger leaves that get carried in. We have also had it running over cords and getting hung up. We have small kids too and also have a bouncer for one of them. It will seem to always try to run up over the floor supports and either keep trying or get stuck and just stop until we move it. We have also had it try to run over clothing pieces as well like socks and it doesn't seem to always try to avoid them. We did have an incident too when it ran over and sucked up a mess made by our cat. Thankfully it didn't do any damage and we were just able to clean it out. There is also a issue with using the app and Alexa. We will try to use Alexa to send it to a certain room or to clean the entire house but if you don't use the exact right words with Alexa it will not go where you request it too, possibly try to do the entire house, or Alexa will just say something off the wall that you weren't even trying to do. For us Alexa will say I can't set the living room bulb to that setting. Wait what? No I want you to send Roomba to clean room x or the entire house. In the app also if you want to get it to say skip a room you can't just have it skip a room. You have to cancel the job and set up a completely new custom job. So you have to wait for it to go back to the base and then empty the bin. Possibly update it's internal maps which can take a bit of time. You don't seem to be able to change any job parameters once a job has started. I would think this would be an easy thing to do but it has been added or developed as far as I know. You must also keep the sensors relatively clean on the dust bin otherwise it will make multiple trips to it's base to empty when it's not really full. You also have to contend with replacing some parts periodically. I hope that one day they make a base with just a dust bin you can empty in your trash can instead of having to use bags. Also rollers, air filters, and the edge brushes have to be replace periodically. That is unless you can find another solution. Even thought with all these little issues I definitely recommend it.

It was *incredibly* helpful to do a couple mapping runs, set up a schedule, and have it pretty much reliably clean the place while I was at work or otherwise out while the apartment was still in flux with things being moved, boxes being emptied, etc. I initially felt this was a great purchase, despite the significant cost.  But as I got more and more set up with arranging this here, and that there.. it began to get far less reliable. First off, the IR sensors on either side scrape along the wall and pick up a lot of paint and scuffing from the walls.

But at some point within the first month or two (it's now been a total of four months and I haven't used it in at least two), it began to ignore whole areas, and eventually barely be able to navigate between the dock and a targeted room for cleaning.  And I maintained the hell out of this thing. I liked keeping it clean and operating well, and would regularly inspect and wipe it down. Initially, after making more significant arrangement changes or getting new pieces of furniture, I'd notice it not working well, or failing to update the map any after a run, and wiped my entire floorplan map multiple times. It seemed to then map run well enough, but it just kept going back to this 'I don't know what the hell I'm doing' mode, and I just got tired of it.

I have five indoor dogs, one (Belgian Malinois) of which is a heavy shredder periodically. Currently, we have snow accumulation in my area (Tennessee). So hair and wet paw tracks are an issue. I have trained my dogs to the “wet feet” command. Upon entering from outside during wet weather periods, I would state “wet feet” and they would sit and wait for me to clean/wipe their feet/paws. Further, the amount of grit and debris carried in from outside in their paws (x 4 per dog) is unbelievable! When you have as many dogs as I do, this can wreak havoc on your back; and especially at my age of 64 years. lol. So, between the grit, wet/muddy tracks, and hair-you spend much time and effort cleaning multiple times throughout each day-wiping feet, sweeping/vacuuming, mopping. Since acquiring this robot, if it’s terribly nasty-wet outside, I still do the “wet feet“ drill, but only if it’s excessively nasty out. My guys come inside onto an absorbent rug, then go about their way. Dried tracks on the floor are no longer a problem. I have scheduled robot cleanings twice per day-(1) midday vacuuming and light mopping in rooms where dogs are, and (2), all rooms vacuuming and mopping at the end of the day (approx 9 pm) when dogs are inside/gone to bed for the night. Then I also have a deep cleaning scheduled for all rooms once per week at 9 pm. The setup and app is not convoluted at all. I suggest you just take the time to review the app and familiarize yourself with it-setup your schedules based on your needs, then setup any shortcuts you might need in the interim of routine schedules. Initially, it seems overwhelming, but it’s really not. I currently have one shortcut set for “pet tracks” and if my guys have tracked and it isn’t in close proximity of my scheduled cleaning time(s), I activate this shortcut and it does a quick vacuuming and mopping of the rooms where my dogs are allowed and have tracked wet/muddy prints. You can setup shortcuts based on your needs per room/zone. The options and pros are voluminous and I’m still learning and adjusting as I go. What I don’t like at all is the cleaning solution situation. You can only use the specified solution per Dreame-and I’m mostly ok with that EXCEPT it is out of stock-everywhere. Another and equally important thing, you have to replace the entire solution container when you run out. There’s no refilling of the container. I find that to be unfortunate in the amount of plastic accumulated and trashed in the environment with each empty container, and most assuredly, more expensive. The solution container should be one capable of being refilled. I’m tempted to remove one star for this, but the robot in and off itself truly deserves 5 stars. That said, SHAME ON DREAME for their (1), failure in their cleaning solution design not being environmentally friendly, and (2), failure to have the cleaning solution available and in stock. If you’re going to design it so only your cleaning solution can be used-then ensure it’s available to your customers for goodness sake! Dreame really dropped the ball, holistically, with the cleaning solution situation. Absent my gripe about the cleaning solution situation- is this robot worth it? It is expensive, by all means; but yes! It is absolutely worth it. It’s been a real back-saving and quality of life improvement for me. PS. In advance, please forgive any typos as I did this review on my phone with autocorrect, which typically has a mind if it’s own. *UPDATE * Almost two weeks into using this robot daily, at a minimum-my life is soooo much easier and my floors are clean. As I have five dogs and it’s wet, winter weather here in Tennessee, I have tweaked the scheduled cleanings due to the nasty wet weather right nite-regular cleanings five days per week and deep cleanings two days per week. I continue to use the shortcut for pet tracks intermittently, for wet tracked paws. I haven’t had my Bissell multi-surface floor cleaner out one time since. Now, does this robot clean deeply like I would? No. But it’s pretty dang close. There’s a few spots in my house it can’t get to such as under my sofa, under the coffee table, my pedestal dining table feet…those are things which will have to be moved under any circumstances to clean underneath. That’s ok. Since this robot was so expensive, I did purchase the 2-year extended warranty for added peace of mind.

A few notes: we have all hardwood floors, a one floor apartment, with one low pile carpet in the living room, so fairly easy surfaces to for the vacuum to clean.  The vacuum and docking station look and feel very high quality. Setup was easy following the instructions and it mapped the house pretty much flawlessly on the first try. I was amazed that it identifies things like a cord plugged into the wall as an obstacle and it’s also great that you can set “no-go” areas if you want it to stay away from certain spots. Once mapped it has navigated flawlessly, making its way around furniture and through various rooms without getting stuck. I’ve set it up to run every day, vacuuming the common areas on one day and the bedrooms and bathrooms on the next, the flexibility it great.  I found that it didn’t do a great job of picking up pet hair on the lowest suction setting, but does a great job on the highest, and the battery still lasts two hours on this mode. I was also able to buy the brush version of the roller for the L10 vacuum here on Amazon to better pick up pet hair (it swaps onto the L20 vacuum easily). The self-empty function works flawlessly, though the voice guidance doesn’t seem to warn you when the bag is getting full, which would have been a nice feature.  The mopping function works great on our floors and I appreciate that the app allows you to moderate the amount of water used since we have engineered floors and I don’t want puddles of water seeping into the cracks. The fact that you can have it vacuum then mop (rather than doing both at once) so it’s not simply smearing around dirt was a thoughtful addition. It will clean the mop pads on its own when they get too dirty, and if you set it up to, it will take off the pads before vacuuming your carpet to avoid water damage. Awesome!

I\\'ve seen this issue reported by other users.  I contacted their support, received some troubleshooting steps, and attempted to resolve the issue. As this is likely some sort of problem that isn\\'t user correctable (the pads are connected fine when not operating, I can turn the thing upside down and hold it by the pads), none of the troubleshooting steps resolved the issue. They informed me that they would have to process a replacement. Fine. I understand that complex products sometimes have issues.  I boxed up the robot and returned them item, as instructed, the next day. After being delivered 3 days later to their warehouse I received no follow up information for multiple days.

While it did take a few attempts to get the resolution I was looking for, which hopefully their department has taken to heart, in the end I was made a happy customer by receiving a replacement after extenuating circumstances.  To the robot itself: After ~9 months of using this, I'm going to buy another (thanks again to the excellent customer service I received at the end). While the original robot did have a minor problem with leaking water from the ports, which was addressed and fixed, it performed very well keeping our entire basement floor cleaned. This includes carpet, luxury vinyl plank, and ceramic tile bathroom floor, complete with 2 cats and a cat litter box in that bathroom. The ability to customize several aspects of the cleaning routine means I can ensure the vacuuming happens before mopping, the mop pads get left at the station for carpet vacuuming, and I can easily set shortcuts and routines to keep the litter box area well-vacuumed and spotless. While the app can sometimes be a little unusual to find exactly what you need, it has a ton of features and so learning to navigate through them all is somewhat expected. Overall, a great addition to an automated cleaning routine with pets in our multi-surface basement flooring situation.  A special thanks to the customer service rep who helped work through some extenuating circumstances with the robot being sent from the repair center that was damaged in transit, and helping me to get a replacement robot from that unfortunate circumstance.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': None, 'reviewer': {'name': 'David J.'}}, {'title': 'Upgraded to X40 | L20 Struggled', 'body': \"----- UPDATE ----- It's possible my unit had an issue. When reaching out to Customer service, after troubleshooting, they offered swapping to the upgraded X40 which has FAR superior hardware. The dock area has been clean after running for a month. Overall clean is better with no mopping marks and less deep cleanings required. Obstacle avoidance is better. Litter pickup is great when on max mode. The reduced high means it's clean under more furniture. The stock roller and hair cutting roller I got still match this model and work surprisingly well.  Downsides: The software still has a lot of room for improvement. The app software was almost entirely different between the L20 and X40 and seems to be duplicate engineering efforts. Here are a few recommendations and all seem quite easy. More flexible Google integration (more commands, and room specific commands), allow for 12 hour time. Sort scheduled cleanings by day of week, then time instead of only time.  I highly recommend grabbing an X40, especially if it's on sale. I'm keeping 4 stars as for the price, the L20 leaves a lot to be desired.  ----- Original Review ----- There are a few areas where this product could improve. It struggles with small objects, gets tangled easily, and the floors around the dock often remain dirty. The Google integration is quite limited, and the mapping system can misidentify areas, making it hard to adjust without remapping the entire house. The app is also a bit confusing at first, and scheduling cleanings can be tricky with its 24-hour format.  The roller requires frequent cleaning, and even small debris causes noise issues. Overall, while it has potential, there are some aspects that could be refined for a better experience.\", 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': None, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Yusuf Shurbaji'}}, {'title': 'Game Changer', 'body': 'I purposefully waited several months to write this review so that I could give an accurate description. I have been using this several times a week for approximately 3 months now. It was easy to set up and easy to use; the app was pretty easy to figure out and begin using as well. The machine itself is quiet while in use, it does increase in suction over the area rugs which is slightly louder, but not bothersome. We do hear when the machine goes to the base and empties/ cleans the mop pads, but again, not bothersome for us. We have dogs and cats in the house with the family, so along with the cleanup that we do, this machine makes a huge difference. I think it was definitely worth every penny, and I have already purchased a few of the replacement/ accessory parts (more cleaning solution, replacement mop pads, etc.) for when they’re needed. It has been simple to add clean water and empty the dirty water tank when needed, and we’ve all got the hang of checking the dust bin on the machine as well as the dust bag on the base, and making sure the sensors are cleaned regularly. I love that it identifies obstacles with >60% accuracy so that it doesn’t get anything tangled or worse, drag a mess around the house. Sometimes it misidentifies something, but I’d rather the machine avoid a possible catastrophe and be wrong about the obstacle than the alternative, where it accidentally sucks up a cats tail. I like the performance overall- it definitely is the second best thing to an actual person vacuuming and mopping. I would recommend this especially if you have a larger home as its functionality and performance make it a great tool to have around.

I used to own old zig-zag random Roombas until about 2013 but gave up on them when I decided the the downsides were more hassle than they were worth. Random zig zagging and knocking into every thing was starting to cause wear on furniture and baseboards. Also, they tended to eat things up and get stuck a lot. Using virtual wall, which had to also be programmed, was a hassle.  This thing is completely different and once dialed in has been outstanding. The idea that I could tell it to clean a single room or zone on the other side of the house and that it would just do it and not even have to worry that it would get lost or not finish is mind blowing. Even more so that I could do it from anywhere in the world and even watch it through it\\'s camera.  That said, it\\'s no without it\\'s flaws.  My house is single story 3400 square feet. Mapping presented issues due to the size and limits on how far it will map from the starting point. The base station is in the kitchen, which is on one side of the house. When trying to map from the base station, it will only go a little over 120 feet before it hits a virtual limit and will not go any further. This left the master suite, the laundry room, and a bedroom all at the other end of the house unmapped. The only work around was to map from a starting point closer to the center but then you\\'re not starting from the base station. One massive bug is that if you start mapping without it leaving the base station, it will basically go forever. I finally stopped it after 80 minutes and after it had visited the entire house at least 5 times. Eventually, it started having shifts in it\\'s position which resulted in the nearly perfect map up to that point become distorted as walls it had previously mapped were now being drawn as obstacles and new walls were going up at an angel to the actual walls.  Eventually I discovered that if I click \"dock\" after it\\'s created a map and is revisiting everything it already did in detail, that I could manually save the \"temporary map\". After that, if I manually drove the L20 close enough to the dock and then pressed home on the dock, the robot would dock and add the missing dock location to the map. So after hours of messing with it, I was eventually able to get it mapped and docked.  Another setup issue was not having water. I tried manual mop cleaning 5 times and no water would come out. What I eventually did to fix this was to fill the clean water tank to the literal top and prime the input tube by pouring water into it. That fixed it but this will cause a few reviewers to knock a star or two off.  Other issues.  If you close a door which we sometimes do when it\\'s cleaning in bedrooms and we don\\'t want the sound coming down the hallway into the living room, when it finishes, rather than stopping at the closed door and sending a message asking me to clear the obstruction so it can get home, it just starts randomly wandering in all of the rooms it can get to. It\\'s not lost because the position in the map on the app is accurate to where it really is.  Also, if you close a door and it\\'s part of a room being cleaned, in this case the hallway and the hallway door closing off the bedrooms from the living room, the robot will just stop and say it was obstructed rather than cleaning up go the edge of the door. This is perplexing given that you could put a new obstacle in a room even at a wall and it will happily navigate around it and mark it as an obstacle, but not so with closed doors. The work around for this is to split the two rooms on either side of the door into entry ways about 1.5 feet wide and then merge those into an \"entry\" zone that the door sits in the middle of. However, I\\'d have to do this to every bedroom door adjoining the hallway if I want to clean just the hallway but have the doors closed. Currently I have to open all the doors to all the bedrooms if i want clean the hallway....except for the one that I created the entry zone for.  It really needs to have a concept of doors. We should be able to mark doors on the map and it should understand when doors are open and closed.  It doesn\\'t know when its dustbin is full and will just pack it tight until it\\'s too full to be emptied at the the dock. This happened the first few cleanings and I had to pull all of the dust out of the bins myself. Clearly this means admitting my floors were a mess. After the first complete cleaning, this hasn\\'t been an issue since, but it seems they should be able to know when the bin is full and even more so, should be able to message you in the app if the dock isn\\'t able to empty it. Seems like that could be a photo sensor so it knows when to go home to empty and when it fails to suck out the dust.  Editing is clunky and not complete. When it builds the map, sometimes floor standing items become walls. I\\'d like to be able to edit the walls and mark the floor standing items for what they are.  Carpet marking is awkward. It assumes carpets are parallel to the floor plan rather than at angles which a number of my short pile throw rugs are.  Wish I could save zones since there are several high traffic areas near each other but in different adjoining rooms. I can set zones in these areas and take care of them more frequently without having to do entire rooms, but I have to set it up every time. I can\\'t save a zone config.  Some times rooms next to each other get the same color even though they are split and marked as their own rooms. Wish I could change the color.  The robot will sometimes avoid areas for no apparent reason. No obstacles marked and nothing there at all. I can put zones around the missed spots and it will happily clean them even though it didn\\'t the first time.  Cleaning history shows marked obstacle icons, but you can\\'t click on them and view the photos like you can in the live map. This is super frustrating if you\\'ve already started another cleaning cycle somewhere else.  The scheduled patrol is interesting but useless since it doesn\\'t appear you can auto record video for later review.  Despite the flaws, it\\'s light years ahead of the old zig zagging roombas.  Edit: after living with it for over a week, have run into some annoying bugs.  Floor direction is ignored for zone cleaning. If I pick a zone in a room that has wood floors where I set the direction horizontal or vertical in the settings for that floor type, the robot ignores the setting and cleans against the grooves.  Similarly, if I pick an entire room and select 2x, the first pass will be along the floor direction as specified but the second pass will be perpendicular cleaning across the floor grooves...similar to the zone bug above.  Another issue is that the robot will frequently avoid areas..some times small all the way to large even though nothing was there in mapping and nothing was there during cleaning. Sending it for another cleaning usually results in the ignored areas getting done but it\\'s annoying and happens randomly in every room.  Doing 3x passes in a smallish area with vacuuming and mopping results in the robot sucking up lots of water and basically destroying the HEPA filter. They should prevent this from happening when the area is small enough to force vacuuming first and then mopping second so there\\'s no water on the floor during the vacuuming phase.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 47, 'reviewer': {'name': 'H A.'}}, {'title': 'Good hardware let down by software', 'body': 'The L20 is one of the only two robots currently on the market that purport to be able to keep medium-pile carpets/rugs dry. The other is the Roomba J9+ Combo (also J7 variant by extension). I got both and pitted them head-to-head.  The other unique goal of the L20 is edge mopping. On that, it largely succeeds. The edge mopping has been very effective and reliable, just doesn\\'t get corners as well as it could. It\\'s second only to the Braava M6 in this regard.  However, my biggest issue with the L20 is that it can\\'t lift its mop pads high enough to clear medium-pile rugs/carpet, which is why it also offers the ability to drop the pads off at the dock. The problem with the drop-off idea is that there are many cases where it needs to cross carpet or rugs to get to a place to mop. In order to reach those places, it lifts instead of leaves the mops to traverse the rug. So after mopping around the toilet, it drags that pad across the rug to get back to the station. If I put a no-mop zone around the rug, then the bathroom will be \"unreachable\". The other-related issue is that, even though it detects carpet well, instead of backing off it, it just spins 180 deg wiping its spinning pads on the edge of the carpet. Workaround is to manually create a carpet zone that is about 6\" larger all around than the real carpet. This is overly difficult because, even though the main map shows the detected carpet, it disappears when you go to add a carpet zone. So it becomes a tedious back and forth process of trial and error to get the zone right.  Here are additional issues I have with the L20: 1. Carpet vacuuming performance is sub-par. In my embedded rice test, it picked up 42%, and 52% in intensive carpet mode (but took twice as long). Roomba J9+ picked up 64%. S9+ picked up 74%, as another reference point. 2. On hard-floor vacuuming, the side brush spins too fast flicking light-weight debris into areas it already covered, so doesn\\'t get picked up. J9 does this too. S9+ excels here. 3. Mopping performance is sub-par. I did four separate mopping tests and L20 consistently took more passes to clean the mess than J9+ with Smart Scrub. M6 took even less than J9+. 4. The manual recommends only putting the base station on tile or marble. I only have hardwood or carpet. 5. The recommended/required maintenance defeats the purpose of the auto-mop washing, unless you really need to mop more than 500 sf at a time. You\\'re supposed to empty the dirty water bin after every run. You need to refill the clean water 4x as often as the Roomba (determined by careful consumptions measurements after mopping the same floor). You\\'re supposed to replace the pads after 1-3 months. The bottom of the base station where the pads are cleaned gets nasty, so that needs to be cleaned out regularly too. 6. If your floor can\\'t tolerate cleaning solution, such as a Swedish Finish, then the pad washing won\\'t be very effective without solution. It will just be a cold water rinse. 7. It won\\'t go under bed skirts or drapes. To LiDAR these are impenetrable barriers. Also, glass doors make mess of the maps, so have to go in and edit those. Generally, the J9 mapping is much more accurate. See pics. 8. If you set a no-mop zone and send it to vac+mop, you would think it would just vacuum in the no-mop zone. It doesn\\'t. Won\\'t go in there at all, unless you set it to \"mop after vac\", which isn\\'t an available mode for shortcuts. 9. In general, the app experience is not good. It seems like there are a lot of options, but there are a lot of restrictions, so it\\'s complicated to figure out how to get it to do what you need. It takes way more inputs to do what you want than it should. 10. Voice control with Google Assistant is too limited. You can only tell it to clean rooms that are named with pre-selected names (not custom names), and there is a very limited selection of pre-selected names. Can\\'t launch favorites or zones with voice. 11. There\\'s a low hum that goes on for hours while it dries the mop pads. 12. It doesn\\'t recognize cords when there is low contrast (dark card on dark floor or light cord on light floor). It hoisted itself on to the cord of a plugged-in canister vac to the point of its wheels being off the ground. To its credit it freed itself, but rather forcefully. If it was a table lamp, it might have been pulled off. 13. If you ever stand near it while it\\'s working, it will map your legs, and even if you\\'ve moved quite some time (minutes) before it reaches that spot, it will clean around that spot as if you were still there, unnecessarily missing coverage. 14. Involved procedure to clean a room not reachable from base. You first have to tell it to clean everywhere from the base, then pause it, carry it to the target room, then resume it. It will then spend some time roaming around to figure out where it is, tell you it\\'s failed to locate, then stat cleaning. When it\\'s done cleaning, it will roam around for a while trying to find a path to the base station, then I have to fish it out from wherever it ended up… usually under the bed. Roomba, on the other hand, just pick it up, put it in the room, press the button. It will immediately clean the room and return to where it started when done.  Here\\'s what I do like: 1. Relatively quiet, both bot and station. 2. Unlike the SW, HW seems high quality. 3. Like all LiDAR bots, it navigates well in the dark, including object avoidance. 4. Edge mopping works well and has been useful in real life. 5. The app comes with a nice Android widget, allowing quick access to shortcuts. 6. The app can run on Windows 11 via the Windows Subsystem for Android. This allows for a nice big screen to work with maps. 7. Wheels don\\'t slip when mopping. 8. Has a spot-clean button, which is a lot more efficient then going into app and setting a zone. 9. Cleans up close to objects it recognizes, for example it gets all the debris tracked in from shoes left at the door, without sucking up shoelaces. If I had the risk of pet waste in the house, this would probably not be so good, but I appreciate the aggressiveness for my situation. 10. Good battery life, about 1000 sf for vac+mop.

Decided I wanted to get something with a forward facing camera and AI smarts to try and avoid running over stuff including wires. Also wanted something that could mop our hardwoods. Wanted to avoid the vibrating mob pads like the current Roborocks (except the Q-Revo) because I've read they can cause scratching on floors. The Q-Revo doesn't have a camera and the obstacle avoidance I want.  I was leery about trying out a bot that is so new... from a company I had never heard of with a limited track record, especially at this price point (note I did pick it up during fall Prime $300 off sale which certainly helped).  I fully expected to get it, have it not perform well, and send it back but so far, several weeks in I'm really happy with it. The obstacle avoidance is great. It has only gotten hung on a wire once and that was one that was hanging from a table... black wire... at night. I blame myself on that one. Otherwise, it has never gotten stuck anywhere or drug anything around which was constant with our S6. The map generation is great. I have no complaints with the app. It seems fully featured and highly customizable. I assumed the app would be an issue, but they seem to have their s*** together there as well.  The mopping is where it really shines ;). Being able to kick out one pad to get close to the wall really provides for great coverage. I've included some before and after photos. It really made a drastic improvement on our floors as evidenced by the dirty water that I emptied out. It's not going to remove really stuck on spots... you can see one in one of the photos... but for standard maintenance and keeping things looking good it's great. I was disappointed that when it got here, I found the cleaning solution contains alcohol. The people who refinished our floors told us not to use alcohol products. I thought that might happen and assumed I could just pour my own vinegar-based solution into the cleaning solution tank but didn't realize that there is no cleaning solution tank. You literally insert their cleaner bottle into the unit so there's no way to use your own cleaner. I don't know if this is a way to try and force you to purchase their cleaner or not. Unless and until they come out with a cleaner that does not contain alcohol, I can't go along with this. Thus, I drilled a hole in the top of their bottle, emptied out their solution and filled it with my own with a funnel. Then I inserted that into the unit, and it's been working great. There are warnings in the manual about using their own solution, stating it could cause issues with the base station, but the solution I'm using seems to be working great. I'm using this stuff by the way: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N6EECEY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1  I read some stuff on Reddit about the mob extend ridding up on the wall edge if you have quarter round molding but if that was an issue at some point, they must have patched it as I haven't seen that.  One issue that people have mentioned that I will agree with is if you are mopping and vacuuming at the same time you might end up with wet edges on your rugs. I don't really mind that too much on my entry way rug as it's intended to deal with wet shoes. You can avoid this by setting up your cleaning routine to vac and mop separately in areas where that could be an issue.  This thing is certainly an investment. For people like us that I would call... motivationally challenge.... keeping things clean has never been easy so this thing is a godsend for us. If you're on the fence and waiting for some more people to test it out like I was... I'd say give it a shot. Until Roborock comes out with a Q-Revo with a camera and AI...

The vacuum is fairly powerful and the auto empty works well. Of the three robotic vacuums I've had so far, this one gets the edges of a room way better.  However it's also much taller than my previous vacuums which is annoying. I had to set a no go area around the couch chair to keep it from getting stuck under it everytime. Another thing, if you have a rug with any black on it you will have to tape over the sensors on the bottom to get it to vacuum that area. This worked fine for me since I don't have stairs, but I could imagine it being problematic.  The mop has an annoying design flaw. The Velcro holding it on is at the back of the mop pad, so anytime the robot goes over a bump (i.e. cord or different floor heights between rooms) it folds up underneath and you're only mopping with half the pad. I also don't feel the water releases fast enough so I rewet the pad manually a few times during the mop cycle. Not sure if that's due to the folded pad or designed that way.

You can customize so much in detail with this one. - it’s much quieter than my old roomba but definitely not silent - the self emptying is very quiet - my old roomba would die before making it back to the base but yesterday Consuela charged herself up halfway through then resumed the clean and brought herself back to the base.  Cons: maybe she (consuela) just needs to get used to the space more and will continue to learn and adapt like my roomba did, but she rarely is able to make it through an entire clean and back to the base herself even if I pick up the house beforehand to avoid anything getting caught in her. But each time has gotten a bit better as she continues to map the space. - she is bossy and will scream at you to help her basically until she either dies or you annoyingly have to flip her on her back like a turtle and fish out whatever she’s got, or talk her down from the cliff - the thing that most bothers me is that this is advertised as a vacuum/mop but it barely holds any water and runs out before finishing. For a device that’s marketed as being a 60-day self emptying bin and dials as a mop, they should have some type of water tank within or attached to the home base so that the water will always be full.

Every day, I am happy that I bought this specific brand and model robovac (Lefant M310). I used several other brands previously, but they did not have the many design features that I love about the M310:  · Dust bin is large, super easy to clean, clear (one can see at a glance how full it is and when it needs to be emptied) · Brushless design (is perfect for sucking up pet hairs. I usually run it every two days or as needed. An overload of hair at one time would clog the suction port.) · I love the mop feature (the dampened cloth removes foot prints and enhances cleaning, especially in kitchen and bath.) · I love the small diameter and low height that allows it to go easily under furniture and into narrow spaces. · The flat filter is easy to remove, brush out, and replace. · The robovac approaches objects gently, does not bang into them, and does not damage them. · It is very smart in covering the entire floor area as well as going around the edges and under chairs. · Although it can be programmed, it does not require using an app or remote to function well, which is important to me. · It is quiet (one can be on the phone and listen to TV at the same time) · It runs for more than 2 hours on one charge. · Customer service is excellent and very responsive. I praise Zoey Chang for being so friendly and helpful and sending me spare filters and the mop attachment when they were not yet available on Amazon.

I tested this pretty extensively for a few days as I wanted to give it a fair chance. Considering its price point I knew I wasn’t paying for top of the line stuff but I wanted to see what it could offer.  PROS:  - Vacuum on the hard floors seems to work well enough. Even after running my shark vac it still managed to pick up some debris so I was pleased with that.  - Battery life is excellent. I just ran it for well over an hour and it still has 34% battery according to the app.  - Slim design is nice. It can get under things my shark vac can’t get too because it’s much thicker.  - Google home and Alexa integration works as expected and connectivity to the app instructions were easy to follow.  - App scheduling is nice. CON:  - Water tank will leak on the counter when you’re filling it up. I suppose that’s desirable once it’s snapped into the unit but beforehand it just kinda makes a mess.  - You initially have to get the mop pad wet. That’s understandable. But after a while, even with the water flow turned to high, the middle of the pad dries out and only the edges continue to get wet so you end up getting railroad track style mopping. Completely rendering the mopping functionality useless. (see video)  - The zig zag function doesn’t work in a zig zag. It just does and goes wherever it wants. There is no rhyme or reason. The manual control doesn’t work either. It turns in the direction that you tell it to but stops when it wants not when you tell it to.  - The water tank is small and needs frequent refills.  - Sometimes it finds its dock. Sometimes it doesn’t. If I tell it to go home while it’s near the dock then it finds it without issue. But if I tell it to go home while it’s in another room, it takes it anywhere from 8-15 minutes to find the dock.  - You can’t run this while watching tv. It’s too loud.  - No smart mapping.  - Got stuck on a small entrance rug. This probably isn’t the best vacuum to have if you have both carpet and hard floors as there’s no way to have it not run water on your carpet.  All in all this won’t meet my needs. The mop function just doesn’t perform. Not even well enough to justify keeping. Also, I think the seller is using a dishonest pricing gimmick. I bought this “on sale” for about $150.

It\\'s apparently incapable of cleaning right by its base so dirt just builds up there. It doesn\\'t suck up human hair but just winds it up around the rotating brush, which kind of works, but you have to pull that off and unclog it between every use.  But what I really want to talk about is how much trouble this thing gets in to. It finds \"wall wart\" power adapters plugged in to power outlets along walls behind furniture where it\\'s stuck and has to spin around a lot, and spins up against them until it pulls them out, then drags the cord out. That was before I added horns, too. Sometimes it doesn\\'t even have to be a wallwart. I\\'ll just come home and a lamp will be on the floor in the corner on the opposite side of the room than it was, and it\\'ll take me to realize what happened. I was very confused about this for a while until I saw it happen with my own eyes, where it pulled the bedside reading lamp in to the opposite corner of the bedroom. I added the horns because it was just the wrong height and just immediately got stuck either under a radiator or under the fridge, wedging itself under so that it\\'s wheels are off the ground and it can\\'t move. In some of its escapades, it has pushed a door open I didn\\'t think was possible to just push open (it doesn\\'t react to having hit something until after it has full on slammed in to it), pushed boxes around so that it could get under the bed, then pushed boxes around again so you couldn\\'t see that it had gone under there, then found some thread on a spool in one of the boxes and wound the whole spool up on its main brush, and ran out of battery under there. It took me forever to find it and this mess. It\\'s climbed on top of the cat food tray and apparently climbing on top of that was enough of a ramp that it was able to get on top of the bowl of cat food, where it sat there for a while until I saw what happened just sucking up cat food. It rams in to the cat castle hard enough to knock cat toys off of it, which we\\'ve been placing there to keep them out of its path, then it gets stuck on them or winds them up on its main brush and stops with an error.  It\\'s also not smart about where to go. I keep blocking more and more areas because it just immediately heads to whereever it will get in trouble, get stuck, or really does not need to be cleaned. If the front closet is open, it goes straight there then spends an hour cleaning a closet that no one has used since the last vacuuming. Likewise with under the loveseat... no one has even been in that area, but it\\'ll go just wander off in to faerieland under there. There\\'s a cedar chest in the bedroom that it can barely get under and it\\'ll head straight there and get stuck if that isn\\'t plugged. I got about 20 cardboard cat scratchers to shove under all of the furniture just to keep the robot from going under there and getting lost for an hour instead of cleaning the high traffic areas. I spent weeks just filling in more and more spaces that doesn\\'t need to be cleaned, it gets stuck in, and it\\'s bound and determined to head straight for. I\\'m finding I had to force it to clean main area. I can definitely see the appeal of virtual boundaries or else the magnetic threshold tape that higher-end vacs support. I got this not wanting to deal with an app; even if the app is optional today, tomorrow it might not be and things with apps spam you and are a huge pain, so I appreciate that this doesn\\'t do that and just vacuums.

This little Shark has done a great job at keeping my carpets fresh and clean. It’s really helped with my asthma! I make sure things aren’t on the ground then hit “run” on my phone and walk away. About an hour later, my entire upstairs is vacuumed. I usually run my air purifier at the same time, to keep airborne debris to a minimum. And it’s been a real game-changer for my breathing! After about a week of use, it has accurately mapped out my space. In the app, you can see where it cleaned as well as potential spots it may have missed. The self-dumping feature is great! When I first used it, it collected quite a lot of debris and had to make a trip to the base to dump, and then resumed cleaning where it left off. Now that I run it daily, it collects a lot less each time. I have not seen it get stuck on anything yet. It’s surprisingly good at getting out of tricky spots! One thing I did have to do was put a stopper under a door, as the Shark accidentally started to close the door when it bumped in and then spun around.  I run it at the ”max” level (highest) and I don’t think it’s terribly loud (see video).  The app is easy to use, and I did need to reach Shark customer service for some help and it was very easy to get in touch with a human and they were really kind and helpful.  The other things to note are that it doesn’t come with boundary strips. I don’t think they are necessary, unless you have a big tangle of cords or things that must be avoided. Otherwise, I’ve seen it navigate legs and computer chairs really well. I did get some boundary strips, as I have a staircase I did not want it to fall down. You can buy it as an accessory for about $15.  The other major consideration is WHERE to put the base. It requires 3’ on each side and 5’ in front. I had to move things around and create a “fake wall” in order to meet those requirements.  To be clear, I do not have a lot of animal hair in my environment, so cannot speak to how well it vacuums in those conditions.

I used it for the first time today. I am a family of 5 with no pets.  I will come back and edit this review after I use it a few more times as maybe it will be different after using a couple more times.  As far as suction power goes, it did a pretty decent job.

The self vacuum is a tad bit loud. Though it only lasts for maybe 10-15 seconds so it isn\\'t too bothersome.  I\\'m not sure if the dust bin actually only needs to be cleaned out every 15 days as they say.

I keep the bedrooms closed as a housekeeper takes care of vacuuming those every two weeks. Most of my house is tile floors and I have three small dogs that shed very little.  I've owned a Roomba 960 for about 5 years and was constantly frustrated with it. It got stuck regularly and almost never completed a full cycle. Additionally, we would often turn it off because the noise was so obnoxious. We couldn't run it at night because of the noise and I work from home on regular Zoom calls so I couldn't run it during the day either so the only time available was to run it in the evenings and the noise was too much to deal with while trying to watch TV or even have a conversation. Finally, I had to replace the battery about 4 times and the aftermarket batteries don't work well and the Roomba batteries are seriously expensive.  So....when I saw this Shark, I was skeptical of the price and quality. BUT I WAS WRONG!! THIS IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT!. It is very quiet so I can run it during the day, evening or night with no problems. It rarely gets stuck and only stops when it gets a stick my dogs bring in from the back yard stuck in the roller. I'm OK with that! I now run it every day.  The brushes run slower than a Roomba but there is logic to that as they do a great job of moving the debris into the path of the roller.  The roller-brush (only one) is much narrower than a Roomba but because the brushes do such a good job of guiding the debris, that doesn't seem to matter.  The docking station with the automatic emptying processes works incredibly well. Once the Shark's bin is full, it returns to the docking station and the vacuum (very strong) in the docking station sucks out the debris into a large cup that I only have to empty about once a week. It then goes right back to where it left off and continues its cycle.  When the battery runs low, it returns to the docking station, empties the bin and charges. Once the Shark is recharged, it goes right back to where it left off again and continues the cycle.  The mapping program seems to work very well and I love that the Shark uses a more logical vacuuming pattern compared to the Roomba.  I honestly can't think of any negatives. I would like to be able to just pause the Shark while I'm on a call instead of returning it to the station but that isn't a big deal since its so quiet.

Update: it stopped working after four days. Update #2: I called Shark to troubleshoot, turns out it’s a defective device and they said they could send me a new part, but they were going to charge over $25 to ship it. Pretty ridiculous for a company to sell you a defective device for $400-$500 and then charge you to send a replacement part considering I didn’t break it, it came defective. No more Shark products.  I keep giving this thing a fair try and it’s just so bad. I added a video to show how ineffective this thing is. I ran this Shark one for about 45 minutes, it made it around my entire apartment (though it stopped 4 times telling me there was a blockage or it was ‘too close to a cliff’—when I checked there were no blockages and I live in a one bedroom apartment…there are no cliffs). After that I ran another much much cheaper brand robot vacuum (I don’t think I’m allowed to say which brand on here). But in about 15 minutes it picked up so much more dog hair (and glitter lol) than the Shark did. The video is what was in the dustbin of the cheaper vacuum after the 15 minutes of cleaning *after* the Shark ran for 45 minutes. And yeah, the cheaper brand doesn’t have mapping so it just wanders around and it does have trouble finding the base, but it gets stuck way less often and the Shark almost never maps anyway. Again: don’t waste your money. Down to 1 star after this experiment.  Original review: It only goes row by row, which is a nice option, but there’s no spot clean option or the ability to direct it or anything. I bought a different brand for about 1/3 the price and it’s not perfect but at least you can tell it where to go if you need (with a remote or with the app). For pet hair, this thing mostly just blows it around and picks up maybe half. It’s also insanely loud—I don’t know if I got a defective unit or what but it’s as loud as a 20 year old regular vacuum (even when it’s not on max suction). If it cost $100, it’d be fine and I probably would have given it ~3 stars. But as it is, it’s absolutely not worth the price. Oh and the app is terrible—absolutely useless.

M.'}}, {'title': 'Decent vaccum unit, problematic software', 'body': 'I have some experience with robot vacuums, from an old roomba shop vacuum cleaner, to a recent Samsung robot vacuum. I lost my Samsung to the Marshall fire, so purchased this Shark robot vacuum to replace it. My wife & I had a Shark stick vacuum that we loved, so we thought to give the Shark 911S EZ a try. It cost only $299 at the time I bought it ~25 days ago.  First, the good: The ability of the robot to return to the base and recharge, AND empty its (tiny) dustbin into the base station\\'s dust bin is fantastic. I used the app to program the Shark robot to clean every day at 13h00, so the tiny dustbin doesn\\'t over fill. (If you only vacuum once per week, the robot\\'s dustbin might choke before returning to evacuate contents to the base?) The app will actually develop a floor map of where the robot has cleaned. Tech support is available and the agents speak understandable English....but see below.  Second, the bad: The software that drives this unit AV911S EZ appears to be glitchy. I\\'ve made 5 phone calls for tech support in 25 days, spending well over 4 hours trying to get the robot to operate as designed. It was quite time consuming to get the robot, my wifi, and the app to communicate.  I paid $299 for my model, which has the docking station and attempts to clean in a logical pattern as it builds up a map of your floor plan. This model does not have the AI (Artificial Intelligence) that some very similar Shark models have. This is VERY IMPORTANT, because when you set up the software, the app will ask to choose between AI model and non-AI model. They both have the same docking station, so do not go by the picture on the screen, just remember that AV911S EZ is not AI, so choose \"No\". [Initially the robot would not return to its base. The tech support agent instructed me to delete everything and start from scratch. As the agent guided me through the set up, the question about AI came up and this 2nd time I choose \"no\" instead of \"yes\". The end result was that the robot was able to return to its docking base.] There was still difficulty in pairing the app, the wifi, and the robot. By the statements made by the agent, I gathered that this is a glitchy process that must be repeated until it works. I won\\'t recount the few hours of frustration when the robot would simply run out its battery and stall, as these may have been due to an incorrect set up. If you buy this unit, do yourself a favor and have the agent talk you through the initial set up of the software....there are several places where even a tech-savvy consumer is forced to guess what to do.  Once the robot was paired over wifi with the app, I was able to set a daily cleaning schedule. The robot has rather weak suction compared to my previous Samsung robot, but as the Shark cleans every day, I think it gets a fair amount of dirt. Don\\'t expect miracles: If you run an AC-powered floor vacuum over the rug after a pass by Shark robot, don\\'t be surprised to see a HUGE amount of dirt in the dust cup of the AC vacuum. Its hard to objectively compare vacuum efficiency, but I can say that Shark robot picks up only half as much dirt as the Samsung robot (my previous model is no longer for sale, or I would have bought it again.) But... the large dust cup on the Samsung had to be emptied after every cleaning, whereas the Shark returns to its dock and transfers dust/dirt to the base station.  Another bad point: The Shark needs a lot of attention. Several times during the past few days it has given an stopped cleaning with an app error message that its \"cliff sensors are blocked\". I followed the cleaning instructions and see no dirt on the cliff sensors of this nearly-new unit. Another error message is that Robot\\'s bumper got stuck while trying to clean. Instructions are to \"clean the bumper and make sure it moves freely in and out.\" I see no evidence of obstruction in the bumper. I believe that these are software glitches. I\\'ve spoken to the agents about software issues, asking whether these glitches will be fixed, and when. They seem to understand that the software that drives the AV911S EZ requires a lot of attention. They do not criticize their own product, but they thinly disguise the need to call in for tech help frequently. They urge me not to return the product to Amazon, but to file warranty claims. I\\'m not willing to rely on the warranty. Why don\\'t I trust the warranty? Because if the software is buggy and Shark doesn\\'t intend to fix it, I would spend lots of time working with Shark tech support, until the time I spend far exceeds the time I would\\'ve spent vacuuming manually! Yes, the agents are patient and helpful. But at least three times they\\'ve told me to uninstall everything and reinstall. This is quite time-consuming. My Shark model was significantly less expensive ($299) than the same model now (25 days later)... Now it is $420. Is this the same model, or is it updated? Who can say? I ask these questions but cannot get answers.  Speaking to the point of excessive time: This Shark Robot saves time by emptying its dust bin into the base every time robot returns to the base. The robot requires you to keep your house neater than you might have in the past, as stray objects will interfere with the robot\\'s path--a blessing in disguise. But....I realize that in the month I\\'ve owned the robot, I\\'ve spent more time futzing with it than I would have spent simply vacuuming the floor and rugs!!! I love gadgets, and robot vacuums are cool, but I really want it the robot to SAVE me time.  I am probably going to return this within the 30-day grace period because I don\\'t want to be stuck with a product that may not ever be able to work properly. I would keep it if I had assurance that software bugs were being fixed, but it is not possible to determine this. Today, a decent product is not enough; everything seems to be software driven.

Personalization: The vacuum’s ability to learn and adapt to your cleaning schedule is a significant advantage for maintaining a clean home without constant manual intervention. Versatile Cleaning: The 3-stage cleaning system ensures effective removal of dirt, dust, and pet hair from a variety of surfaces. Affordable Option: Compared to other models in the Roomba lineup, the 692 offers many of the core features at a more budget-friendly price point. Cons: Basic Features: While effective, the Roomba 692 lacks some advanced features found in higher-end models, such as smart mapping, room-specific cleaning, or a self-emptying dustbin. Battery Life: The vacuum’s battery life is decent but may require recharging for larger homes or extended cleaning sessions. Noise Level: The Roomba 692 can be somewhat noisy during operation, which might be distracting in quiet environments. Overall Impression: The iRobot Roomba 692 Robot Vacuum is a reliable and user-friendly option for those looking to simplify their home cleaning routine. Its Wi-Fi connectivity, personalized cleaning recommendations, and effective cleaning system make it a strong contender in the mid-range robotic vacuum market. While it may lack some of the advanced features of more expensive models, it offers great value for its price, making it a smart choice for maintaining daily cleanliness with minimal effort.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 9, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Samrat Roy'}}, {'title': 'Works great!

Easy to hook up home base and connect to the irobot app.  Product packaging states run time is 2 hours, but I\\'ve had this thing run for nearly 3 hours before it died.

The first time it runs it essentially \"maps\" the area and does a pretty decent job remembering thereafter.

I would recommend it for elderly people who have a hard time vacuuming, but i would suggest setting a timer for the middle of the night as well as maybe putting a light on it for trip hazard.

I bought this Roomba to replace my old Ecovacs Deebot N79S, which had started to show its age (earlier than I thought) and stopped cleaning like it used to in the beginning. I made my decision to buy this Roomba based on the reviews, high ratings, and a holiday discount at Amazon. It had much higher rating than the Ecovacs Deebot model I had. It was a wrong decision and here\\'s why:  I don\\'t see much difference between the cleanings this Roomba and the old Deebot did (when it was younger, that is). Surely, the Roomba has more suction power, but it\\'s not a better vacuum cleaner for what one must pay for it excluding the holiday discount I got.  The Roomba is so loud that it rivals my upright vacuum cleaner in that respect. The Deebot was much much quieter. For instance, I didn\\'t have to stop that while I was on the phone. This, I must.  I know these mid-level (and low) model robo-vacuums do not have the best programming embedded in them to do \"smart(er)\" cleaning, but on an equal level, the old Deebot was much smarter than this new Roomba. I have to say this is dumber. I even started verbally arguing with the thing. I rarely spoke to the Deebot. The days of meaningful silent conversations with my robot cleaner have been long over. :-P  This vacuum cleaner is also very forceful; when it hits an object (e.g., a pot sitting on top of a plant stand), it may knock it down. Luckily I was always near my plants when such accident almost happened; I had to \"gently [honest!]\" guide the cleaner to somewhere else though it kept wanting to come back. It\\'s unnecessarily fast and forceful. It gets more confused than the Deebot did when detecting gaps and obstacles. When this Roomba hits my office chair while I\\'m sitting in it, it moves both of us for an inch or two. And, no, I\\'m not that light and I\\'m not joking. What kind of motor did they put in it?  This Roomba always has hard time finding its home base. No, the base is not in an obscured place. When it is running low on battery, it doesn\\'t seem to power down. It keeps cleaning--as loud and fast it was when it started its job--while looking for its home, which sounds like a great idea for maximizing the amount of cleaning, but then it ends up depleting whatever the charge remaining in its battery and finds itself dead somewhere in the house. I don\\'t remember how many times I had to carry it back to its home. The old Deebot didn\\'t have the same difficulty finding its own home base (which was where I placed the new Roomba\\'s) and it powered down when its battery was low. It quietly looked for it and didn\\'t bother with cleaning, which was done already anyway. I am not saying the Deebot never had difficulty in this respect, but it wasn\\'t as consistently bad as the Roomba.  I don\\'t care much for the seemingly-fancy smartphone app one \"must\" use to operate this Roomba either. I guess it\\'s nice to have features like getting a notification when it\\'s stuck or when it\\'s time to clean out its bin, operating it remotely, and setting its cleaning schedule with ease, but these features quickly turned into non-factors after I had time seeing the cleaner in action. The old Deebot didn\\'t have any of these features--I had to use its rudimentary non-that-remote control device to set anything or control it, but I was happier with the job it performed, which matters more.  Also, this Roomba didn\\'t come with a kit that provided extra side brush(es), filter(s)/bin(s), or other parts that need to be changed periodically. The old Deebot came with a kit that provided extra of the same. It\\'s my mistake to assume that the Roomba (for this price) would provide extra parts (at least an extra side brush would be nice as it\\'s one of the first things to go).  So, all in all, I do not recommend iRobot Roomba 692. After our one-way toxic conversations (monologs, that is) reach to their detrimental peak, I\\'m sending this away (I\\'ll probably donate it with a note on it saying that I wasn\\'t happy with it, but someone else who likes conversations with a strong vacuum while it\\'s shouting might -or- drop it off the town\\'s garbage disposal/convenience center without a word).  Lastly, one might think that I\\'m recommending Deebot, which could have easily been any other brand. I am not. I used my experience with it as a baseline, which in turn I used to judge Roomba\\'s performance in the same house with the same obstacle course. You may already have or get a Deebot and dislike it because your expectations are different than mine. My review is based on my own experience with both. What I put here is merely my opinion. Your mileage may vary, as they say.', 'rating': 2, 'helpfulVotes': 40, 'reviewer': {'name': 'B.B.'}}, {'title': \"Tips if you're thinking about a Roomba (updated)\", 'body': 'Here are a few tips if you\\'re thinking about getting a Roomba (which you should!)  1. Wait until Prime Day or an equivalent sale. I bought this model for $220 (tax included). If you live in the Seattle area, watch out for the Amazon deals - Amazon vans will park random places for one day only to offload products at a steep discount. The Roomba is a regular for that rotation - I\\'ve seen this model sold for $140.  2. Do not buy cheap knockoff versions for replacement parts on Amazon. Buy only iRobot products (from them directly if possible). There are a lot of versions of fake products from Chinese companies sold on Amazon. These parts are crappy and could impact the performance / lifetime of your Roomba. One example of that is the replacement air filters. The cheaper versions do not seal correctly, so dust gets into the small cracks and other mechanisms within the machine. Replacing your vaccum will cost a lot more than a $10 air filter.  3. Clean your air filter with a toothbrush after each use to reduce the clog of dust. Replace the filter every 3 months.  4. Do a deep cleaning of your Roomba every 6 months. Use a mini flathead and a small phillips to take off the front cover (you\\'ll need to take off the small, yellow spinning brush first using the small flathead). Be careful because the threads of the tiny screw are mounted in plastic casing. Very easy to strip. Clean out all the hair around the small screw that attaches the spinning brush (after 6 months, this can cause the brush to stop spinning - 90% of the time, it\\'s just hair - side note - this motor is also replacable for only $15 on the iRobot website).  I\\'ve noticed a fair amount of negative reviews discussing the shelf life of Roombas. People are making comments like \"My cats killed our Roomba\" etc. I\\'d like to set the record straight for this awesome company. Basically, in life, you can\\'t get things for free. You can\\'t expect your car, for instance, to function well over time without regular maintainence. Most people hate car maintanance, so it has become widely accepted for most people to pay someone to fix / clean their car. And, for most people this makes a lot of sense. We\\'d rather spend our time doing other things besides changing the oil, checking the tires, checking the radiator, maintaining the engine and so on.  For vaccums, the mechanics are much less complex than a car. However, they still incur a ton of wear and tear like dirt, cat hair, female hair, dust, and eveything else that lands on the floor. Over time, even the best vaccum will break or need repairs if it is not well maintained. In the old days, we had vaccum repair shops because people hated working on their vaccums. Then, everything possible became automated and outsourced. We could have Roomba repair shops that cost $30 to do a tune up of your Roomba. People would probably pay it. But, rest assured, the same people complaining about paying for that would be the same people who complained about the amazing Roomba - the vaccum that does its job with very little work from the human. The only thing is doesn\\'t do well is clean itself. What we need is a cat Roomba.  My closing thought is this one. Spend one hour every three months maintaining your Roomba, and you will save yourself 50+ hours a year (a whole work week) of vaccuming. That\\'s very simple math, but it will require some effort on the part of the human. I purchased mine on Prime Day 8 months ago. I did my first deep clean (along with the regular air filter cleaning with each use) and she is gently purring like the first day I discovered her :-).

We don’t have any family around to help out with chores after baby is here which will leave my poor husband a 5 acre plot of land, a house, three dogs, and a wife/baby to tend to all by himself for a little bit. I also can barely get anything done since I have to vacuum every other day right now. My poor cankles!  Out of desperation I gave this a try since it was on sale and, God bless America, this is the best thing ever.  Ill start with cons since thats what most people really want to know:  Wifi was tricky to connect BUT the best place for the base in my home is on the opposite side of the house from the modem. I could have moved it closer if all else failed but after a good 20 minutes of trial and error, I got it connected. After that, the app was very user friendly i found.  My dogs have a little water spillage by their bowl so hair sometimes sticks from the roller into those spots but its a small space and doesn’t bother me. I usually do a whole house pick up before I start it anyways.  Because of the immense amount of hair this thing picks up, I empty it weekly. Again, not a big deal to me.  PROS:  Literally everything. It does a really good job at mapping my house. It gets in corners shockingly well. Its not perfect but if it misses a spot, you can send it on a “spot clean.” This model doesnt have lots of bells and whistles. No mopping feature, not super silent. However, that usually means it does one thing very well and that is vacuum. Thats all I wanted. Something to pick up dog hair and dirt from dogs and husband. While its not dead silent, its way quieter than my giant Shark pet hair vacuum. I also don’t need something totally quiet. A baby can definitely sleep through it. Its more like white noise to me. And you can adjust the volume of the base from the app. No dog hair has gotten stuck in the rollers but if you find Sharky is leaving behind clumps of hair, you probably need to empty out the base.  Note: I have only hardwood and tile flooring. It goes over the mat by the door very well thus far but keep in mind I have no real say in if this is great for a mostly carpeted home.

It\\'s app enrages me more every single day and I\\'m about to simply put it in the attic because without the app it becomes increasingly useless; I wish I could take away more stars this app is so bad. I\\'m hoping SharkNinja cares enough to read these reviews and actually takes action, otherwise they may go the way of Sonos with their horrible app decisions. This isn\\'t 2005 when iRobot could do stupid things and get away with it because there was no competition. While I\\'m not one to throw money away, I will replace this with something else that actually works and doesn\\'t need an app to do simple scheduled cleaning runs. I could give two hoots about whether it has a \"map\" at this point, just clean the doggone floor -- do the basic thing you claim to be able to do and do it well. Is that so hard?  I\\'m guessing they don\\'t care given they can\\'t seem to do simple things like when I log into their website with exactly the same credentials I use in the app, it doesn\\'t show my registered products, or when I scan the QR code in the app to store the Model and S/N it can\\'t store it for more than about 5 minutes before it literally just disappears. If you can\\'t do simple things, complex ones are probably out of reach.  The system has some kind of serious software bug in it related to map storage. I work for a software company, and all the signs are present that there is a significant problem with the storage system for maps and/or the communication between the app and the robot relating to the map. I say this because our robot just lost its map one day about a month ago. No errors, no problems running, it just literally disappeared. The schedule continued to run, so I didn\\'t notice it until I looked at the cleaning notification one day and noticed that it was reporting a run time of almost 2 hours (which sounded about right) but a 0 ft squared cleaned. It sure made a lot of noise and picked up a lot of dirt for not cleaning any square footage of my first floor! When I dug into the app, the map was gone. Just not there. When going into settings to look at the map, I just get the infuriating purple spinner. No messages, no indicators of a problem, just a total lack of communication about what is going on and no map.  So I set about the task of trying to correct the problem. First, I delete the map and go to try and re-explore. It seems to delete, and it will run an exploration run, but then it just sits with that obnoxious purple spinner and the question about whether the map represents the home properly or should it re-explore, with the Accept button greyed out and NO OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE. I\\'ve re-explored 20 times and left it sitting on that screen overnight for 8 hours with it never finishing. Ever. And this is why it\\'s about to become trash!!! Without running the explore successfully, you can\\'t set the schedule! You can\\'t run a manual cleaning run with the app! If I wanted a vacuum I had to physically go push the button on, I could have bought something a heck of a lot less expensive (which is what I\\'m likely to do at this point).  SO then I thought, like most technology of this sort, it might just need a complete fresh start. Stuff happens, memory gets corrupted and needs wiped, no problem. So I deleted the robot from the app and had to go through the mind-numbing and excruciating process of re-joining to my post 1995 WiFi network which is too fancy and elaborate with its new-fangled 5GHz technology for these developers to figure out (or Shark is too cheap and obsessed with profits to use a more modern WiFi SoC). Go through that process and run the explore another 10 times with no change.  Then I reset to supposedly factory settings. Same result. Same absolute rage-inducing nonsense getting it to connect to the WiFi (though I think I finally figured out the trick on that). I am not convinced it actually DOES reset to factory settings or wipes the memory clean, because I\\'m continuing to have the same problem. Exploration simply will not finish successfully and so I can\\'t schedule or make it clean without having to go under the table and push the button. Total ridiculousness. A factory reset should restore a copy of the firmware as it was when it came out of the factory -- and mapping worked out of the box. Now it doesn\\'t. I am left with the conclusion the reset does NOT actually reset the memory.  This is just infuriating. Oh, and before you say \"contact support\". I have. Crickets and bullfrogs, ladies and gentlemen. So far, crickets and bullfrogs. If that changes, I\\'ll post a new update, though.  Message to SharkNinja -- when you released an app, you became a software company. That has certain requirements and sets certain expectations. You are FAILING to meet any of them.  +++ HOW TO DEAL WITH MODERN WIFI AND THIS RIDICULOUS TWELVE CENT WIFI CHIP +++  The key to making this work is whether your phone is trying to access the Internet or any from anything other than the same 2.4GHz connection this unit is using. So what I have to do:  1. Log into Eero and turn of 5GHz (on my version this is under troubleshooting; nearly every mesh single-SSID system has a mechanism to temporarily disable 5GHz b/c this cheapness is so prevalent in so many devices) 2. Turn WiFi off on phone and leave off for a couple of minutes (this is a precaution to make sure 5GHz is truly not picking up the connection) 3. Turn mobile data off on my phone (airplane mode didn\\'t cut it 2 out of 3 times; turning off mobile data always worked) 4. Turn WiFi back on and make sure Bluetooth is on; if you tried airplane mode and left bluetooth off and don\\'t turn it back on again until the app prompts you, you\\'re hosed and will have to start over from the beginning - I experienced this multiple times 5. Put robot into discovery mode 6. Connect to the robot and go through the unnecessarily plentiful prompts full of stupid and useless information in the \"wizard\" 7. When you get to the network selection screen, your WiFi network SSID should show up --- if it doesn\\'t, one more thing to do is go into your phone WiFi settings and join your 2.4GHz network (keeping the Shark app in the background), which will disconnect you from the WiFi Direct connection with the robot; let it connect fully; then go disconnect from your access point and reconnect to the robot WiFi Direct AP in your phone settings. 1 out of 3 times I had to initiate that re-connection, which I\\'m guessing is due to some sort of timeout happening, but I\\'m not sure.  ***** PREVIOUS REVIEW ***** I got a previous version of this vacuum robot for my wife\\'s business space and was super impressed with it. It didn\\'t really NEED me to use WiFi and the app to make it work, and wow, she knew the floors were dirty, but not THAT dirty. It\\'s done really well for her in the couple of months she\\'s had it.  Come Prime Day 2024, I figured I\\'d pick something up for the house. Our Jack Russell terrier is getting older and shedding like a monster, and I abhor dog hair, so having something that could help us keep up with that was desirable. Having been an early adopter of the Roomba back in the day, the one thing I abhorred and has kept me from a robot vacuum since going through 2 or 3 early versions was emptying the anemic dust bins on these things. The self emptying on my wife\\'s has been awesome and I was looking at this to be even better because AI, right?  Well, yeah, not so much.  As a physical vacuum, the unit cleans pretty well. I don\\'t have any real complaints there, and the self-emptying is nice and has worked well so far. LOTS of dog hair in that bin. More than I realized was present, actually. Gross. But it is hands-free to empty which is pretty awesome. So it does clean (perhaps) even better than I expected.  This unit leaves me utterly disappointed in the app and it\\'s supposed AI, however. The intelligence is pretty artificial from what I can tell, and not in a good way.  Getting the system to map the house took three tries before it decided it actually did need to go into the big 20 square foot, devoid of any furniture, people or other obstructions area in my mud room. It did finally map the full space, and shows the area to be roughly 900 feet. By my calculations that\\'s roughly right, and the map is pretty close in its shape, though there is a big blob in one of the rooms I still don\\'t quite think aligns to reality. But it\\'s close enough, and the vacuum will still go into the area represented by the blob, so I\\'m not really sure what that\\'s about. I guess I could be misinterpreting the display, after all I don\\'t have Artificial Intelligence, I just have my brain.  Where the app falls utterly short, though is there is no true practical use of the intelligence the system has built about the area. It has a map, but can\\'t really use it in a meaningful way! The value of a robot vacuum isn\\'t to make a bunch of racket while running around a specific room while I\\'m entertaining or trying to watch a movie. The value proposition of a vacuum robot is to automate tasks I don\\'t want to do on my own. Like scheduling a cleaning job in a specific room at one time, and scheduling another cleaning job in another room during another time window. Being able to send the robot to a specific room ad hoc isn\\'t in the top 5 basic requirements I would post for a system like this. Top 10, maybe? But not before actual honest-to-goodness helpful AUTOMATION.  But Shark has not deemed the utilization of the map with the schedule to be an important feature for their app. It\\'s an FAQ as to whether you CAN do that, so it isn\\'t like they don\\'t KNOW people want this capability. And multi-point scheduling is something that vacuum robots have been able to do for years (iRobot\\'s app can do this for most models now, for instance, as can other brands). Multi-point scheduling is such a simple app task at this point there are libraries available for plugging that kind of function into a mobile app. Come on, Shark, you aren\\'t in the least bit intelligent if you can\\'t actually use the intelligence to do something useful!!! THIS IS SHAMEFUL and speaks to a complete lack of either 1) understanding your customer use cases or 2) caring enough about your customer to do something besides put your shortcomings into an FAQ.  SO you can\\'t schedule the vacuum to work on specific rooms it has mapped out at specific times, scheduled cleaning is an all or nothing thing. BUT, if you enable a no-go zone to try and, say, keep the dogs from being too overly disturbed during the all or nothing scheduled cleaning, that area is now apparently a black hole singularity for the vacuum and can never be gone into again as long as the circuits of the poor little creature draw power. Unless you of course go to the pain of deleting the no-go zone to get it spot cleaned, and then have to work with the app to maybe successfully recreate it.  The creation of rooms and no-go zones has been a spotty and painful action within the app. Sometimes it works, sometimes it hasn\\'t. I\\'ve had to go so far as to reboot my phone to get the \"resizer\" of a no-go zone to resize or move around on the map and the app acknowledge and save it properly. I\\'m done recreating the zones and will just sweep those from now on, I\\'m so fed up with it. The fact that you can\\'t override these zones for a spot clean, is again a sign of either complete development laziness or incompetence. It\\'s a simple matter of a question -- \"you\\'ve asked to spot clean this area, would you like to override the no-go zone for this session\" and then let the little guy run wild in his heretofore restricted space. It\\'s AI, after all, not just common human intelligence we\\'re working with here!!  The reason that the all or nothing approach to scheduled jobs sucks so bad is that this thing is LOUD. My wife\\'s unit is not loud like this one (I\\'m guessing the \\'superior\\' AI brain of this model must be making the loud clacking sound on our home model, but I\\'m not sure). From the first run taking it out of the box, it has made a terribly loud clacking sound as it runs around picking up dirt. I\\'ve looked at all the troubleshooting steps and the brush isn\\'t clogged, there\\'s nothing stuck in it, and it is firmly in place like it should be, but it definitely seems as if the bristles or the little blue sweeper stripes are hitting the cross bar of the guard hard enough to make an obnoxious sound. I know it\\'s brush bar related, because when the super brain was running around the house for three hours mapping things, it was actually relatively quiet -- enough so that if that\\'s how it was when doing its job, I\\'d have no other problems; alas that\\'s not the case.  SO, when you\\'re trying to get that scheduled all or nothing cleaning done overnight, and the kids are downstairs in the basement trying to sleep, all they hear is a thwack-thwack-thwack-thwack-thwack sound as it runs around the first floor. And since it seems ~900 square feet of space is too much for the system to do on a full charge, it starts doing that thwack-thwack-thwack thing at 3am after it has returned to the dock and recharged.  I do really like the \"return to recharge\" and \"return to empty\" features, don\\'t get me wrong they\\'re awesome, but with all the racket and the all or nothing approach, I can\\'t get the whole first floor vacuumed and the kids a full night\\'s sleep. It\\'s rather sad (first world problem, I know, I know, I should put brooms in the kids hands -- we do that too!) but for what you pay for this device (even on Prime Day) that claims to have an AI engine at play in its favor, I expect more.  And just to be clear, this isn\\'t a house that\\'s filthy with layers of dirt all over the floor by the time the little dude gets going. We swiffer and sweep throughout the day to clean up spot messes and we\\'re not living on a farm or something where we\\'re tracking in mud three inches deep a day. There\\'s kid chaff and some dog chaff around, but this isn\\'t a \"heavy\" mess we\\'re dealing with on a daily basis.  While I don\\'t love the unit, it does appear to me that proper app development and updates would resolve the problems I have (outside of the noise). I could work around the noise with more powerful intelligence brought to the scheduling, though, so I\\'m hopeful they\\'ll put the work in and resolve the shortcomings. If that happens, stars could easily be added to the review.', 'rating': 1, 'helpfulVotes': 14, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Charles'}}, {'title': 'Great for dog hair - it gets my tile and wood floors clean!', 'body': 'The media could not be loaded. I bought this vacuum during this year\\'s Prime Day because I wanted to replace another brand that just wasn\\'t doing the job picking up my German Shepherd\\'s dog hair. I was constantly having to stop the other unit and pull hair out. After looking at online reviews on this one and another popular one and really reading the reviews, especially ones about dog hair I chose to purchase this one. So far I LOVE this one. I have all hard surfaces (wood and tile) in my house and it cleans both really well and here\\'s why. First, the roller on it isn\\'t a \"brush\" roller, it\\'s simpler and hair doesn\\'t get tangled up in it. When I first set up the vacuum it mapped my house and afterward, I was able to set up zones or rooms so I could select specific areas to vacuum such as high traffic areas, etc. After it mapped the house I could see the \"map\" of the house and it was pretty accurate. Then my vac started cleaning and I could even select the level of clean I want also. But wait, there\\'s more! Lol I have the app on my phone so I can select clean, ultra clean, eco/normal/max. I have it on ultra clean. So here\\'s the great part, my last vac was \"random\" whereas this one literally goes row by row to vacuum and it also does the edges. I have included a video so you can see what I\\'m talking about. Then my vacuum, aptly named \"Hair Destroyer\" will take itself home and the base will literally suck all the hair/dirt out into the basin storage and my vacuum goes back out on its\\' merry way to keep on cleaning! YASSSS The unit recharges nicely, is easy to make schedules (I have mine on Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat) and I haven\\'t seen the hair on the floor. It is also cleaning smaller rugs by the doors well.  The clearance height on it is a little higher (about 4 1/2 inches high) but it still goes under the couches and most other furnishings I have. I still have a dust mop for areas around plants in the corners, etc that are not wide enough for it to fit through - hey this thing isn\\'t perfect but it\\'s close. Next, you\\'ll want to know that with as much dog hair that this thing picks up I empty it every 2nd day it runs to keep the bin in the base clean. Some people said it filled up quickly, well mine did the 1st couple of times also because of the amount of hair it picked up.  This unit is not loud, it\\'s quieter than my last one. I read reviews that said it was loud but it isn\\'t. It plays a sound when it\\'s going home to empty and then it plays a different sound when it\\'s going back out. Neither bother me. Be sure to let it map the house, you\\'ll be glad you did. Be sure to register it. I had one issue of it not getting the charge but I think it was user error and when I called customer service (CS) they were helpful and it was back to doing what it\\'s supposed to do. The preliminary steps the CS rep used to determine what was wrong were in my opinion elementary, items I had already done but the customer service rep said it was required. Overall, I really wanted to write this review because I really love this unit.

Overall, I love it, I would recommend this particular vacuum to anyone. But I have never owned a \"smart\" vacuum, just a cheap one that runs around aimlessly so I have no other vacuums to base my opinion off of besides what I think of how this one performs.  Positives first: • row by row vacuuming. It overlaps it\\'s last row so it doesn\\'t miss anything • scheduling. You can set it to auto vacuum whatever day and whatever time you want (see negative below for the other side of this opinion) but I love the scheduling. • does great on carpet and tile. The wheels adjust quite a bit to accommodate the carpet and dropping to the tile off the carpet. • adding \"no go\" areas. On the map on the app you can place a no go area in a mapped out area. For me, I placed a no go around one of my couches because the vacuum doesn\\'t see the back of the couch as a boundary so it had no issue off roading up inside the couch and then getting stuck. Hilarious initially, but at least theres the no go function so I could put an end to it\\'s off roading adventures. • picks up way more than I figured it actually would! • leaves suction lines in the carpet, and no animal hair left after it makes it\\'s rounds. • Cleans up next to EVERYTHING! I figured it would hem haw and somewhat get near things to clean, nope, it gets right up next to every edge. • if it misses a spot (something in the way etc) it will go on cleaning but I\\'m the end make it\\'s way back to that spot to try cleaning it again. • self emptying base that is BAGLESS!!! • Price. Yes it is still expensive, but there\\'s more expensive out there, and for what you\\'re getting I believe the price was good. Caught this one on sale.  Now for the few negatives.... • Scheduling. Remember the positives I mentioned? The negative to the scheduling is you can\\'t set a different time for different days. I set mine to 6 am. So everyday I have it scheduled it starts at 6 am. No 8 pm on Monday, 6 am on Tuesday. You get one time choice. Next thing, you can\\'t schedule it to go off more than once a day. You can only pick if you want it to auto clean that day and that\\'s it. Next thing, if you have it map out your entire house initially, when it auto cleans you cannot choose for it to only clean certain rooms on certain days. It\\'s all the rooms only. So, I only had it map out the half of my house that I want auto cleaned everyday (I have a baby gate that closes off the hallway to the rest of the house so it only mapped my dining room, kitchen, and living room that are all attached). • after you do the initial mapping of your house you cannot \"add a room\" to your map. If you want to add more rooms to your map you have to delete the current map and have it remap the entire house again. • capacity of the base. It\\'s supposed to hold 30 days worth of hair, dander, trash, etc. If you actually live in your house, or have animals, don\\'t expect it to hold 30 days worth of stuff. I have to empty mine every 2 to 3 days, and I don\\'t have a big house or a messy house. • notification messages on the app. Initially on the app it didn\\'t have many notifications about the vacuum, but after using it for a couple weeks and getting it broken it seems like it has notifications constantly. It will have several messages about being near a cliff and it\\'s going to fall off (I have no stairs or anything it gets caught on?), It will constantly tell you that you need to empty the bin or that it has debris blocking the bottom of it that you need to clean. And usually it has none of those and the bin isn\\'t full. It\\'s weird. But worth noting on the review. •also worth noting, very seldom, but on my tile floor sometimes the bristles will actually knock the debris away from it instead of sucking it in. I\\'m sure all of the robot vacuums have this issue.  In conclusion. The scheduling and the mapping mentioned above is my only complaints and something to think about if you\\'re considering buying this. But you should definitely get it if you\\'re on the fence about it!!! I have no regrets about my purchase besides I wish I would have bought it sooner! I love having a clean house that I don\\'t have to physically keep up with to maintain!

Highly recommend this vacuum to everyone, my wife agrees! Happy wife, happy life! Might buy another for my upstairs. For a robot vacuum, it does what I expect and makes my life easier. I don't make it pick up large debris, robot vacuums seem to perform best with small debris. Large debris may get stuck or caught. Lidar works phenomenal, but with some hiccups when mapping house (mostly human error). Routing around obstacles works well, slows around objects and if anything is bumped it's so light and cushioned, it's not a problem. 5 stars overall. 4 stars deep cleaning and suction leaving room for improvement, it's a robot vacuum, what do you expect? Probably has Alexa integration, but I use Google assistant and it works great!  ---  I ordered this back in July 2022 and got it end of the month. I waited some time to let the excitement die a little before posting a review, but it never really did. This is my first robot vacuum and one of the best purchase decisions I have made this year. When researching for the right robot vacuum, I found that most of the highly rated vacuums don't seem to make it past 6 months or a year when reading reviews. Also manufacturers seems to make new models every year, so finding something that is reliable and lasts longer than this timeframe is hard to find. Of course, I am only onto my 5th month of owning this vacuum.  When I broke the vacuum out of the box, my first inclination was to take it out and get it started. But thinking about the other reviews I have read on this vacuum and others like it, I wanted to read the instructions first. This is not a regular vacuum that you plug in and push. It has lots of little parts that make it different and potentially not taking care of it properly could damage the device. So anybody reading this, read the instructions first. Understand how to properly take care of it and clean it. Also, comparing to other reviews, clean it regularly.  Now for my somewhat long review:  Is it quiet? Yes and no. It is a robot vacuum, how loud do you expect it to be? You're not doing the work, but it is. It is quieter than a regular vacuum, but no idea how quiet other robot vacuums are. If a robot vacuum is loud or quiet, who cares? What matters is that it can clean stuff.  Can you watch tv while it runs? Yes you can watch tv. Just turn up the volume a little, no need to blast it like when running a normal push vacuum.  Can it pick up everything? No, it's a robot vacuum. Don't put too much trust in it. What I typically do is remove all obstacles (cords, bags, blankets) from the ground and any larger debris that might get caught in the motors (cotton balls left from the dog, pieces left behind from chewed up toys, strings from rope toys).  Dog hair? My dog constantly sheds, but has short hair. I run it twice per week on thin carpet and once per week on hard floors. I don't notice the dog hair until I see what the vacuum picked up and it does a great job! The majority of stuff this picks up is dog hair and a lot of it. For longer haired dogs or thicker haired dogs, I assume this will get the job done as long human hair doesn't get stuck at all like my regular vacuum does.  Small leaves? It picks up small leaves and debris similar size, but may leaf some behind. It also might get caught in spinning brushes and make a slightly louder noise on hard floor. I waited for it to finish and then pulled the leaf out, no harm.  Dog kibble? Ok this one was an accident, didn't see it against the brown colored floor before starting vacuum. Sounded like the robot was choking and about to die, literally. I had to stop it right away and retrieve the small rock sized (width of thumbnail) dog food from the vacuum.  Can you run it when away from home? I read too many horror stories of vacuums cleaning pet poop, but it is not the reason I don't start it when I'm not home. Like the last two points, if something gets caught, you need to be there to fish it out. I may have spot checked the floor, but even that sometimes isn't good enough. Also, one time a week or two ago, it finally got confused and couldn't move past a futon leg. It kept spinning back and forth (maybe for 5 minutes) until I nudged the futon half an inch, then it broke free of its endless loop. This was the only time this ever happened since I got it. Every other time it does an excellent job of finding its way through, even finding its way through a jungle of table and chair legs.  Lidar mapping floorplan? Simply amazing! I had it map 4 different rooms. The first time was great, but missed a few minor areas, of which was my fault. I left things on the floor and in the way of the robot when it mapped the floorplan. The second time, I removed the obstacles, but it didn't map another room properly. The third time, I removed a chair, which the robot vacuum had just enough clearance to fit under (1st time it went under, 2nd time it did not), so that it can map that area of the carpet and not count it as a wall.  Lidar in general? It works great to avoid obstacles and get around legs of any sort. Only thing is if the leg is curved, like my kitchen table, it doesn't know when to properly maneuver around it. But no worries! The bumper is amazing! It lightly bumps in to obstacles and the vacuum does a minor adjustment to figure out how to go around it.  Damaging furniture? Nope! Doesn't happen. The robot is so careful around obstacles and even when it does bump things, its lightly bumps it and doesn't scratch or anything. When it approaches obstacles (walls or furniture) it moves at a slower pace. This thing is intelligent.  Suction? For a robot vacuum, it does everything it needs to and does it very well. There are different levels for suction in the app, I have only needed to use the normal section. The max suction I have never needed to use, but it is an option if things get too out of hand. There is also an ultra clean option, not tried it, but think it just spends more time going over stuff. If I ever try ultra clean option, maybe need to change deep clean star to a 5, but I'm making the assumption that it will never perform as well as a normal vacuum.  Battery? I run two rooms per day I run it, but sometimes do all 4 rooms when I forget to run it. It lasts easily to finish all 4 rooms with charge left over. I'm guessing lowest percentage of battery life was 35% or 40% after doing all 4, this is a wild guess though, could've been higher. For 2 rooms it's usually at 60% after it's done, that I know for sure.  Emptying? It has a bin that it empties to. If the robot either runs for too long (or not sure if it senses if it is full of junk) it may return to the docking station to empty itself. This system works great, but the bin needs to be cleaned out occasionally. There is also a filter in the bin system that needs to be cleaned, just like regular vacuums may have.  App? No issues running it on my Android. Can select rooms and see the layout easily. Drawing rooms works great as well!  Robotiness? It makes all the noises a robot vacuum should and it's awesome! Just thought you should know! Beep boop boop!  Ratings: I give it 5 stars because as it is a robot vacuum, it meets all of my expectations. 4 stars on deep cleaning and suction because it isn't perfect, but is excellent as a robot vacuum. I haven't used my regular vacuum in the areas that this one runs because it seems to do such a great job. Integration with Google works great! I don't use Alexa with this one. Again, this is one of the best purchases I made this year. Definitely recommend this vacuum to everyone.

My floors look great.', 'body': \"I had been browsing robot vacuums for some time and finally took the plunge on Prime Day. It was easy to set up out of the box, the robot vac is configured with an app on your phone. Steve McClean needed time to charge before he could map the floor plan. I bought Steve for the upstairs which is wall to wall carpet with tile in the bathrooms and laundry room, and a week later added Rosie for the downstairs, which is all hardwood with throw rugs. I followed Steve on his first mapping mission and was impressed that he figured out the stairs on his own. I couldn’t fully decipher the map of the floor plan he produced on the first go round to set up no go areas, I did that step after a few runs when I had completed job maps to compare with. Steve did a great job on all floors the first time out. I had vacuumed with my Shark upright ahead of time and I was amazed by the amount of dust, hair and lint the Steve picked up. Steve goes under beds and tables the upright couldn't get to. After a few cleaning sessions I purchased Rosie for the downstairs which is all hardwood floors with throw rugs. Rosie is scheduled to work every night, I love walking downstairs in the mornings to clean floors. Through the app I was able to set up both robots to specify rooms and no-go areas on the floor plan, and schedule cleanings. When I had an unscheduled call during a cleaning session, I was able to use the app to pause Steve until the call was over. I allowed the app to send notifications to my phone and have received notifications for low battery when the robots are accidentally bumped off their docks and a notification that Rosie was going to fall off a cliff. Turns out she was just tied up in some cords. She stayed there all night until her battery died. Cords are a challenge for the robot vacuums, it has forced me to put away any cords that are not in use and organize those that are. I’m still working on identifying and setting those areas up as no-go. I work at home during the day and have set up Steve’s cleaning times for when I don’t have calls scheduled. The vacuuming itself isn’t particularly loud but the emptying when going to the docking station is. The robots dock themselves for emptying and charging. I had to move Steve to a lower traffic area, so he wasn’t getting bumped and taken off the charger. Overall, I am thrilled to have automated the cleaning of my floors.

It doesn’t have geo-fencing and related functionalities; or water refilling at the base, but you’ll only find these in robots costing three times as much, so it’s not even a fair comparison. This robot has very good specifications and functionality. Battery autonomy for roughly 2 hours of operation; and a water tank for about 30 minutes (more below). It also includes a charging base and the robot can automatically park into it. I’ve had it for two weeks and I’m very happy with it.  Breaking it down: this is my honest experience with this robot, the Vipsun Z1, and I’ll lay it out like I’d like to have read before buying, with all the important info about how it works from the user’s perspective.  Instructions in the box contain graphics detailing all parts and accessories. They’re simple, and contain everything you need to know to assemble the robot’s parts.  The link for the app goes to their website, but I highly recommend you find it on Google or Apple stores (app is “ROPVACNIC”), because apps are vetted there (security) and you’ll also be able to get updates; while a manual install from their website will be static and not update.  The only initial setup is wi-fi. For me this step worked without issues. Instructions also include troubleshooting, should the connection fail; and alternative ways to connect, which is very thoughtful, especially if you’re not very tech-savvy.  Unboxing it, you just need to put the brushes in place, the dust box with air filter/refillable water tank and the pad with the mop on it – that’s it!  Included are also: an extra pair of brushes; an air filter (consumables); and an IR remote that allows for all basic operations: power on/off, select automatic, manual and other working and send to charge.  To start, just put water in the tank, power it on, select automatic mode and it just goes and does its thing – it doesn’t get any simpler than that; even granny will love it!  The app has added functionalities and works also when you’re not home: seeing robot status, running time, battery percentage and any error. You can change vacuum power (high/mid/silent) and water rate (high/mid/low/off); see consumables life; and “find my robot”. You can set schedules with: starting hour, day(s), water (on/off); and recurrence.  Battery lasts for about 2 hours in medium suction and water for 30 minutes in low flow. Robot stops at 15% battery to go find the charging base. Charging takes a little over 4 hours. Not draining the battery and the slow charge are good for a longer battery life span. Quicker charging isn’t really necessary, since autonomy should be enough for most houses.  Robot doesn’t have geo-fencing, so once it starts cleaning, it’ll go in random trajectories and through all open space. It has short-term obstacles and wall memory and does a very good job in going around chairs and furniture feet to ensure good cleaning; and following wall edges.  To work with the robot’s absence of geo-fencing, you can close doors to have it clean rooms individually or just hallways and adjacent areas. You can also put obstacles in door passages or hallways to limit the working area - good to keep the robot from wetting all floors (it’s random, remember?) while you’re also there.  It’s very important to get as many wires off of the way as possible. It actually does a good job in not getting stuck with them for the most part.  Sometimes, I’ve seen that the mop isn’t leaving its whole width of the floor wet, so I set the water flow to medium; it seems that the water flow isn’t exactly precise.  Since the autonomy of the water is about 1/4 that of the battery, what I do is when I want to start a run, I take the removable box from the robot, empty the dust box, manually wash the mop pad in the sink with a little dish soap, so it’s clean and already wet (for longer low water flow). I put the mop pad back in the fittings, then a little no-rinse and no-foam wood floor soap in the tank and the rest with water. Fit the mop pad in the box before filling the tank, otherwise the water will drip freely through the tank’s holes.  It has happened, though, after one or two water refills in the current cycle, to still find 30% or 40% of the water left after the 30 minutes, so I suspect that if you just keep it working continuously, it might automatically turn off the water so it lasts longer, but most times it just drains the tank in 30 minutes, so that’s what I count on.  So, there you go, that’s my personal experience with the Vipsun Z1 after two weeks, what I’ve learned about how it works and how to make it work the best for me, according to its characteristics. I’m very happy with this purchase, especially given the price and what you get for it. After you read this (wow, you made it here?!...)

I have found that it vacuums best when using the \"Strong\" Suction Adjustment. I am surprised at how much hair one Viszla produces. The vacuum, dubbed \"Optimus Grime\", finds dog hair, dirt, and other debris. The dust box has plenty of space to handle the debris it finds. It\\'s easy to remove the dust box and empty it over a trash container.  Setting \"Optimus Grime\" up for the mop function is simple. Just add water to the tank.

Keep in mind, the water tank will need to be replenished about half-way through the cleaning.  \"Optimus Grime\" does not map the room. Instead, it bounces off furniture and other objects.

This innovative gadget seamlessly integrates vacuuming and mopping functions into one sleek device, making household chores not only more efficient but also surprisingly enjoyable.  One of the standout features is its versatility. It effortlessly transitions from vacuuming carpets and hardwood floors to mopping tiled surfaces with just a switch of the cleaning attachment. This dual-functionality saves me both time and effort, as I no longer need to switch between different tools or appliances.  Moreover, the device is impressively easy to use. The controls are intuitive, allowing me to adjust settings and navigate corners without any hassle. Its lightweight design makes it maneuverable, even in tight spaces, and the battery life is more than sufficient for cleaning multiple rooms on a single charge.  In terms of performance, I am thoroughly impressed. The vacuum suction power is strong enough to pick up dirt, dust, and pet hair effectively, while the mop attachment effectively removes stains and leaves floors sparkling clean. The device handles both dry and wet messes without any issues, maintaining consistent cleaning performance throughout.  Another feature worth mentioning is its low maintenance. The removable dustbin and washable mop pads are easy to clean, ensuring the device is always ready for the next cleaning session.  Overall, the Vacuum and Mop Control device has exceeded my expectations.

It knows the names of objects, rooms in the house and areas without being told. It never gets stuck!!!

Not complicated like unwinding hair (my daughters have really long hair and they shed like the dogs) from a brushroll.  THE CONS My last vacuum came with floor strips that you could place across doorways, tops of stairs, etc to keep the vacuum from entering. This was helpful so that I didn\\'t have to close all the bedroom doors to keep the vacuum out. (My kids leave clothes and charge cords and thing lay around in their rooms--things the vacuum would get hung-up on.) This one doesn\\'t have that feature. It has sensors so that it doesn\\'t run into things like furniture, but the sensors don\\'t notice things that aren\\'t at least a couple inches tall.  The run time is close to an hour. That\\'s plenty of time to clean my living room and kitchen, but if you have a larger space or more rooms the battery may not last.  The biggest con is that the app stopped connecting to the vacuum. I LOVED the remote feature. Especially so that I could keep an eye on battery level, but it hasn\\'t worked for a long time. I\\'ve had the vacuum about 18 months and for the last half of that, I\\'ve been patient, hoping app updates would correct this, but every so often I try to connect the app to the vacuum and it fails to pair. It\\'s not user error. It\\'s a fairly simple process and I\\'ve done it before. If the app worked I\\'d have given it four stars.', 'rating': 3, 'helpfulVotes': None, 'reviewer': {'name': 'MrsM'}}, {'title': 'Works Great', 'body': 'I was skeptical because it was so cheap.

I called customer service and they helped with stup*d troubleshoot process that I had already done my self like, clean everything, take it on and off from the outlet etc. Then, after this, the robot stopped charging. They told me to send an email with a video, my order number and the ASIN. Ok, I did everything.  But the problem is they take up to 48h to reply to your email, not with the answer but with more questions. First then said they didn't find my order number from amazon (like I'm sorry, how and why would I made a order number up?). Then they told me they couldn't open the video, but then they suddenly could and they noticed I was getting mad. After, they asked me for a picture of the charger to make sure it wasn't fake. Now they are asking for a picture of the motherboard. I don't even have the tools for that.  This is absurd!! I got this robot like 2 months ago, I'm still in the 12-month warranty policy, and instead of helping, they are making this a bigger problem than it already is. Do not buy this brand. Buy iRobot, its more expensive but the robot is better and their costumer service are great. OKP LIFE NEVER MORE!  Update: after this review they finally send me a new robot. From one stars, I can give 2. They keep pushing me to update here. It is said that I need to complain in order to get my issue done. But at least it was done and I thank the team for that. Rose was the one who helped me. I don’t even blame her, she was cordial and helpful. The problem is mostly about the procedures and value of the company.\", 'rating': 2, 'helpfulVotes': 8, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Catarina Valladão'}}, {'title': \"Good for it's price\", 'body': \"Honest review here. It actually has better suction than most I've seen. It has been working my upstairs for a week and hasn't found all thr areas of the rooms yet, so I'd give it's navigation skills a 2. It has a filter to prevent dust from escaping, however the fine dust sticks to the filter and I have to take that out and shake it. Because of its size, I empty it every day and the empty process is cumbersome. It does recognize the stairs and has not fallen, so that is also a plus. It was super easy to program. My overall rating is a 3.5, I gave it a 4 simply because I paid $70 for it, and in the world of robot vacuums, that is a steal. There are better robovacs out there, but for thr price, it holds its own\", 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': 2, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Devon Megan'}}, {'title': \"Can't access app\", 'body': \"I just received the vacuum a week ago, and I would normally not write a review this soon. But there are already an issue. First, let me say that the unit seems to operate well. It runs a linear pattern instead of the random pattern of many units. It is quiet. It is running on hardwood and does a very acceptable job. Don't know what it will do on carpet. My problem is that the app will not load. I know there are things controlled through the app that there is no other way to access. I've tried to contact service, but they have not responded. Only other comment so far is that there is no 'dock' button. If I want it to return to it's charger, I have to pick it up and move it there.\", 'rating': 3, 'helpfulVotes': 2, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Gary J. Kleier'}}]}, 'reviewsTotal': 921}}}\n"
