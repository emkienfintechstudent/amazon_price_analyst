      "Body: I’ve had this vacuum for only 1 year but it’s already deemed itself useless. It gets stuck in the dumbest places on nothing and doesn’t know how to get out so it just turns off. It’s advertised to be able to go over surfaces but it doesn’t. It also constantly runs into things and hasn’t mapped out our house like advertised. It’s very loud when it is running and only runs for about an hour, if it doesn’t get stuck somewhere and turns off by then. I’m disappointed considering how high the reviews were before I bought and still are. Maybe I got a defective one but I’m about ready to throw this thing in the trash. *UPDATE 07/26/22* STILL THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY. This thing is set to go off at 9am every day. It goes off at exactly 2:11pm. I work from home now and almost always have meetings during that time. The vacuum is loud as shit and is like a cat who constantly wants into only the room I am in. We've reset it multiple times to fix the time, doesn't work. Sometimes it even goes off in the middle of the night at 1, 2, 3am for NO. REASON. Then gets stuck on air and screams for 2 minutes.

Luckily I kept my \"old\" upright vacuum which is about 11 years old and still working beautifully. I tried to call IMartine, but no one ever answers. I send a message to the website and they send a video with instructions. I also called Amazon but they said it is now six months so they cannot help and that I should call IMartine. Unfortunately, this seems to be the end of this vacuum. I am now 70 years old and really looked forward to the ease of having the house cleaned without any stress of having to bend down to move it around or to move wires. I am extremely dissapointed at the response to this distressing situation. No more IMARTINE for me\n",

However, within just a few months, it had already fallen down my stairs 8 times and the side brushes quit working all together. This caused the vacuum to quit altogether. This is in spite of me following all of the manufacturers cleaning and maintenance instructions that came with the vacuum. My vacuum worked for 3 months. This vacuum has a manufacture's warranty for 1 year. I contacted Amazon after the vacuum quit working and they provided a link to the manufacturer to file my concerns. I submitted all of my findings along with how I maintained the vacuum. They responded within three days asking for the same things I already provided along with a video of the problem. I replied with the requested information and then all went silent. I emailed them a again 1 week after submitting their required information. It took them 1 week to respond saying they are investigating a solution. All correspondence stopped at this point. That has been more then one month. This vacuum needs to be taken off of the market.

It became caught in certain areas where I had to redirect it, so I was glad I did not leave it to run on its own. However, when I tried to use it a 2nd time it refused to work. it would not come off the charging pad, no matter what I did.

      "Body: Play Video After comparing multiple different brands of robot vacuums I decided to take chance and buy this product instead of the name brand one to save some money as it had pretty good reviews... just learn from my experience and spend the extra cash. Do you have furniture in your home? if so, don't buy it. Do you have rugs or bath mats? If so, don't buy it. DO you expect dirt or fur to be picked up? if so, don't buy it. This vacuum has actually turned into a running joke at my house because if the vacuum is turned on myself or my daughter have to \"babysit\" this thing because it is inevitable that it is going to get stuck on any and every piece of furniture, and it will avoid any messes at all cost. At this point, the vacuum stays on the charger and I just sweep daily because the constant getting stuck on furniture and beeping is enough to drive a person insane. The sensors as advertises, are none existent, it runs into any and everything, humans, pets, walls, furniture. The one good thing I have to say is that the battery charge last at least 2 hours, which would be an awesome feature, if only it actually did its job, but at this point all I hear is 2 hours of beeps, so this is a very fancy appliance that has grown to collect dust. This vacuum is the first and only item in my burn book \"mean girls reference\".\n",

I’ve read the manual and followed all the “error instructions” and still nothing. Sensors have been looked at, it’s been charged, and I even swapped the brushes to the replacement ones that came in the box and still no luck. Received it late September and didn’t bother opening the box because we were moving to a new home soon. After moving in last week I was excited to try the vacuum and it worked well for one go round.

After 6 months, it started making this awful LOUD sound when vacuuming. It is still picking up great, but that noise is intolerable. I reached out to iMartine and they have not responded, through email OR phone. Their support phone number goes to a VM box that is FULL and wont take any messages. DO NOT buy from this company unless you enjoy throwing your money away! I don't have much hope at this point but I would like a replacement. Also my remote works but the timer on it has NEVER worked. and yes the time is right and the set time is right, it just never turns on.\n",
      "Title: A disposable vacuum\n",
      "Body: I bought this in August 2020 and it worked great for about ten months. After that, it began to rattle and make an intolerable loud noise while operating. I contacted seller and they suggested I clean it thoroughly, which I had been. I oiled the side of the beater brush so that it would spin smoothly, but that only temporarily fixed the horrible, loud noise. The battery began to lose power after ten months of use too. It would run for twenty minutes, then need to go back to the dock to recharge. Now, 14 months later, it is totally dead. I wouldn't recommend this vacuum unless you are vacuuming maybe 500 square feet, or less, maybe once per week or even less, if you want it to last. Not recommended for bigger spaces, or a home with pets. Save your money and the environment and invest in a quality brand, like a Roomba. The NY Times has a good review article of better quality robot vacs.\n",

      "Body: I'm a busy guy so anything to save time is incredibly exciting. Unfortunately, this was more of a time-kill than a time saver. It worked great the first couple of weeks, and cleaning and emptying the storage is a fairly straight forward process but the negatives far outweigh the positives. Ultimately, I will be returning. - It's really good with hair. Litter, sprinkles, little pieces of dirt it doesn't suction at all even right after the machine has been cleaned. It takes spilled cat litter and spurts it around spreading it all over the room and ironically creates a bigger mess. - It moves with really no rhyme or reason. It moves aimlessly and after a whole hour still misses entire chunks of the floor. It's incredibly frustrating to watch. - Will need to cover the same spot 2 or 3 times to get a good clean. - It gets stuck at least once per cleaning use despite my furniture being lined up against the walls. - It's a lot noisier than I thought it was going to be. I'm fortunate to live in a house. In an apartment with non-carpeted floors, there are high chances that it would be too noisy. - Overall it's less frustrating and more time-saving to use a regular vacuum and just do it yourself.\n",

Sometimes it says its fully charged but it won't respond to the remote unless I flip it over and hit the power button a couple times, then when it comes on it says it's not fully charged. I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money on this cheap vacuum.\n",

      "Body: My perspective: I hace 3 German Shepherds and I live in a rural area in the desert. This is my second robovac. My first was an ILife. I LOVED IT! She (Rosie) went haywire (started going in reverse) in less than a year but while she was working my floors were spic and span. I decided to try something a little more expensive WITHOUT the mop feature hoping to gain some longevity. So I purchased this one with a beater bar (Marti). SO Rosie and MArti clean like a woman and a man. Rosie ...Spic and span but totally went bazerk after 7 months and now needs therapy. Marti has a well thought out clean out ..... SOOOO much nicer. That is where the good ends. Why Marti comes with a beater bar I will never know.. It does nothing but pick things up and deposit them on my 2 throw rugs (I have bare floors). NOT ONCE have I emptied dog hair from the hopper! Marti just wraps it all around himself and then beeps angrily at me for \"Maintenance\" I have run this vac for 2 weeks and had to \"service him\" 4 times. I swear it is like we are dating! Rosie picked up EVERYTHING and never complained. Marti runs around the house and SQUEAKS CONSTANTLY as if he is saying ..\"look at me I am cleaning\". Rosie was so simple. Hit go and she would take off. Marti I have to \"warm him up\" on the remote and dang near get on my knees and touch the remote to Marti to get him to go. every 3 days I have to shave the hair off his beater bar and wiggle his drive wheel. (I cannot get it removed so I have to wiggle it until some debris comes out. Marti's receptacle NEVER has any hair in it...only dirt. Rosie picked up dirt and hair and rocks. Marti just collects the hair around the wheels and beater bar. overall, Marti was more expensive, less effective, noisier, and constantly gets stuck on the recliner.\n",

      "Title: Gets stuck frequently - Disappointing!!!\n",
      "Body: It has been almost four months since I bought this robo vac. I've used it 8 or 9 times in that timeframe. It worked like it was supposed to initially, redirecting itself whenever it bumped into a piece of furniture and returning to its docking station when its battery got low. But then it started stopping and beeping at me every one or two minutes. It would stop and beep in the middle of the floor, so it wasn't even doing it when it got stuck under a piece of furniture. I then had to re-start it manually. It would then work for another minute or two before stopping and beeping again. This meant I had to be in the same room with it in order to restart it each time. Also, it stopped returning to its docking base on its own. It would just run out of power in the middle of the floor, and I had to return it manually. It's pretty useless if I have to supervise it this carefully. It's much faster and more efficient just to clean your floor with a regular vacuum cleaner. I finally threw out my iMartine. This was my first robot vac and it will be my last. What a disappointing experience!!\n",

      "Body: I was so excited to get the real Roomba for Christmas. My daughter wanted the same for her birthday. Not wanting to spend the $$ on a Roomba I bought her this one. After comparing the two I vote - Robot iMartine1600! Quieter, doesn’t get stuck, cleans better. This one doesn’t find his way home and has a remote vs iPhone compatible but this doesn’t matter to me. Imagine my surprise to see my older daughter also bought the iMartine 1600 and moved her Roomba to the basement! Update-first one died after two weeks. Wouldn’t charge. Replaced it and the replacement did the same thing- would not charge! Returned\n",

      "Body: Does not run for more than a few minutes at a time on carpet. It will stop and beep called company and tech support they told me to shake the vacuum to fix it of course that didn’t work would not buy it again wanted to trade it in apparently I can’t do that just get the run around on how to shake it to try and fix it.\n",
