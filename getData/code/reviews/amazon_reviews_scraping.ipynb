We have 4 cats and 2 dogs, so the hair and dust that comes along with pet ownership is a daily challenge and this has seemed to help tremendously with keeping house presentable and not having to do a deep clean when having visitors. From the living room to the kitchen floor is slightly elevated and was able to get up over the lip and continue on its way. Every time I empty the collecting compartment it is full and extra confirms its effectivness. We haven't tried the mopping feature yet and briefly tried to register vacuum to app with no success. Overall for the price well worth it.\n",
      "Title: Great product for the price.\n",
      "Body: Love this vacuum. Have been using it for about 3 weeks now. Love how quiet it is, it has very good cleaning suction picks up all my dog hair. And mops as well. I bought this is a replacement to my other name brand one and I must say I was surprised in how much better it was than the more expensive brands. It can be used as a vacuum only or vacuum and mop at the same time. Would definitely buy again and recommend.\n",
      "Title: Truthful Review\n",
      "Body: I gave it 5 stars because I got it on sale and its worth the value I paid for it. Would I get a different one if Im willing to pay more…yes. This vacuum works awesome. You have to change the settings to maximum suction for best results but works good on low. Mop works but if you add the water it will drag the wet pad over your carpet. At first one of the wheels was having a problem I thought I would have to return it but it’s worked its self out. I have a dog that sheds and it’s awesome with picking up dog hair. The remote doesn’t turn it off and the manual directions doesn’t really work. It also has a app that one will turn it off but manual still doesn’t work. Over all it works great now I want one that is self emptying and has a smarter mop system. Over all this is great its the gateway to investing in one. Love it over a regular vacuum hands down!\n",

I can now put my baby to sleep on time while knowing that my kitchen floors would be clean in the morning. The box comes with the instructions manual. It is easy to set up and start using.

      "Title: Exactly as expected\n",

      "Body: I always thought a Roomba was a luxury item, until I saw this one at a discounted rate. I love everything about Buddy Marshmellow, the name my daughter and I gave it. Easy to assemble and use. There’s an app that you can download to schedule cleanings and manual direction, very simple to use. It’s quiet and picks up very well. It goes back to its home base with the press of the home button. I highly recommend the Tipdiy Robot.\n",

      "Title: Exceeds my expectations\n",
      "Body: I love the fact this vac didn't have a rotating brush, because things get rolled up in the brushes. I am using it on a tiles floor which I will also mop so having a straight suction is preferred. I like that using the remote I can increase or decrease suction. When mopping, I can also select the amount water used while mopping. It did exactly what it was supposed to do. It does a thorough job cleaning. I would definitely recommend and buy again down the road.\n",
      "Title: Robot vacuum cleaner Performance and battery life.\n",
      "Body: Robot vacuum is working perfectly all over the place in the house. Picking up all the dust small crumbs and moving all over the place. Best thing is doesn’t fall off when reaching to stayers case. Battery life is long enough to clean three bedroom and living room even though reaching to kitchen too. I’m impressed. ❤️ the product. 👍👍👍\n",

      "Title: New and improved model - well-designed and versatile\n",
      "Body: I am a previous customer of a RopVacNic robot vacuum that did not have the mop. This newer one is quite versatile, doing both regular vacuuming and tile/wood floor mopping. It's as good at obstacle avoidance as the previous model. Now our home is cleaner than it used to be. Progress!\n",

      "Title: Great for what it does\n",
      "Body: I bought this vacuum for my beach condo. I already had the ROPVACNIC dry vac and like how it performs. Even if I first vacuum with my upright, then let the ROPVACNIC go, I am continually amazed how much additional dust and debris it collects. So when they came out with this vacuum with a mop feature I thought it would be good to try in the condo which collects a lot of sand. So far I am just as impressed. Set up and initial charging was simple. I have not yet tried the app as I wanted to test the basic performance. It cleaned well, has great battery life, and is very quiet. Seems to be very intuitive as to how to get out of jams. The mop feature is nice but it will not replace general mopping. It wets a microfiber cloth that is attached with Velcro along the bottom. It doesn’t suck up dirty water will not deep clean your floors. I really do highly recommend this little vacuum, it performs as well as my original ROPVACNIC and the mop feature is a plus. I do not think you will be disappointed purchasing this unit.\n",
      "Title: Excellent for the Price!\n",
      "Body: It's the first time i own one of these and i'm honestly surprised on how good is for what i paid, it's rare to find other Roomba that vacuums+mops at this price range, recommended!!!!\n",
      "Title: Game Changer!\n",
      "Body: This thing is so much fun! I have personally named mine “Alfred” but that’s besides the point. One thing about Alfred is that he does not connect to the WiFi is my current living location. I work for a Housing department at a college and therefore am partially paid with an on campus apartment, meaning that I use the college’s WiFi. You need to have your own 2.4ghz connection to properly connect using the app. The remote still works perfectly fine with Alfred, but you do need to purchase AAA batteries as it does not come with any. I also want to mention that I’ve only had it for 3 days so I cannot talk about long term usage, but I can confirm it vaccums and mops very well! You do have to be careful about chargers or any sort of cords touching the ground as it will grab them and keep moving forward which either results in your cord being relocated or the robot getting stuck! Since this robot doesn’t have a tank with its charger, you need to clean it out every couple times it cleans your place (probably every time if you have a large space).\n",
      "Title: Very quiet. Cleans well.\n",

      "Title: Amazing Price for Such a Powerful Vacuum and Mop Combo Cleaner\n",
      "Body: I rarely write a review for a product. But I am very happy about this new robot of mine. For a low price, most robots can only vacuum. I like the fact that this one can mop too. Compared to my old Shark vacuum, this one is way stronger and has more functions. The cleaner is easy to set up and the App is easy to install. I LOVE the Manual mode option in the App. I usually let the robot clean in Auto mode, BUT when I see it running to places I don't like, I can press the Manual mode and direct it to a different direction, without having to stand up and move it. In addition to the App, this robot comes with a remote control, which is a bonus if you don't want to download the app.\n",

      "Body: From the moment I set up this vacuum, I was impressed by how intuitive and easy the process was. I love the ability to control it with my phone, and how agile it is while on the go. What’s even more remarkable is how effectively it cleans. My floors have never looked better! Whether it’s navigating around furniture or picking up every speck of dust, dog hair, and debris, this little device works tirelessly and flawlessly. It charges quickly, and the battery lasts long-term. It takes alot in and doesn't require emptying as often as I thought it might. I have very long and large wooden floors, so no longer having to worry about daily sweeping or vacuuming has saved me countless hours of effort. Its efficiency, thoroughness, and ability to tackle various surfaces are truly impressive. I am genuinely amazed at the technology behind this product and how seamlessly it fits into home.

      "Title: Not cat proof lol\n",
      "Body: So, this little vac is great. I named her Beastie. She doesn't pick up bigger things, like pieces of cat food, but does do a good job with dust and cat hair. And, we have 30 rescue cats! The remote is tricky, because when you push the \"on\" button, it flashes red. I didn't think it was working, but pushed other buttons and the commands worked. The only complaint I have is she doesn't always want to go \"home.\" I've tried pressing the home button from the dining room and the dock is in the living room and no response. It seems she needs to be right in front of the dock to actually put herself onto it. Now, why did I post a picture of one of our cats, Julia? Hence, the title of this review! She figured out how to push the button and get Beastie to vacuum, and then she follows her and tries to bunny kick her! Therefore, we have to keep her turned off when she's not in use!\n",

You don’t have to go back through and sweep after this robot vacuum because it performs flawlessly, things don’t get tangled up inside, and is an a time saver. It is easy to set up and use. The suction power is incredible! It picks up our hair and my pets hair really well. It’s not cheaply made like others, inexpensive, finds its away around the house and back home to charge easily and holds good charge. This vacuum is super smart and the mapping feature works.\n",
      "Title: It works well!\n",
      "Body: We have had this robot vacuum for about two weeks and it has been working very well for both hardwood floors and rugs. It has good suction power. It is very easy to set it up and very straightforward for cleaning. It is not noisy and navigate the house nicely. Overall, this robot vacuum is a very good alternative for some expensive ones. It dose its job, as expected, with a very affordable price.\n",
      "Title: Does it's job\n",
      "Body: I have only been using this for two days so here are my thoughts: 1. I haven't used the mopping feature yet so I can't comment on that. 2. The directions are a little funky and could be more clear. 3. It is easy to start and set up though. 4. This will not pick up big pieces of food or items (goldfish, etc). 5. It does pick up all of the crumbs from my toddler and cat hair though. 6. It can get under my couches which is very nice. 7. The sensing works pretty well but can definitely go wonky sometimes running over things it shouldn't. Overall it seems to work well and it definitely makes things easier for me! My toddler also enjoyes it chasing him.\n",
      "Title: Very quiet! and convenient\n",
      "Body: Play Video I'm not new to robot vacuums, but we really needed an upgrade from my old Roomba and decided to give this one a shot since it has mopping capabilities. It is notably quieter compared to my old model and performs quite well with vacuuming and mopping. It's easy to use and keeps the floors tidy with minimum effort; thus, this is great for daily cleaning. I also appreciate the included remote control, which adds convenience. The water tank is small, but that's fine for me. I didn't want a big, bulky machine taking up space in our already small living room. Overall, it's a great fit for our needs.\n",
      "Title: Better and longer lasting clean with great mop function\n",
      "Body: Amazing product, cleans and mops very well and is sturdy and much more efficient and has more charge in one cleaning than my previous one. I am super impressed by the mop function and this has helped me to automate cleaning at my place on a schedule from my app- awesome experience!\n",
      "Title: Affordable option\n",
      "Body: I haven’t used this for long, but so far I am really liking it! It doesn’t get stuck too often and picks up a lot of dust and dirt. One thing I do like from my previous model is hair doesn’t get stuck in the brush bristles as much. The dirt container is also larger. Overall cuts back on sweeping and vacuuming which is a win! I haven’t tried the mop feature yet or the wifi, but I am excited finally try it out.\n",
      "Title: Efficient and effortless\n",
      "Body: This robot is easy to use and efficient at cleaning. It’s able to mop in places I can’t normally get to easily like under furniture, etc. the sound is very minimal too for my dogs sake. Would recommend this to the busy body who doesn’t have time to vacuum and mop every day like me\n",

It feels sturdy and well built and battery power has not been an issue. We are super excited for the mop feature to clean our laminate flooring and has done a great job.

The app with Bluetooth connection is easy to setup and use on your phone.\n",
      "Title: Super efficient for the price\n",
      "Body: I have two dogs and the winter makes it hard to keep paw prints wiped and mopped up. This is perfect! This doesn’t replace my normal cleaning but it’s good for the in between when I don’t have a lot of time. I was pleasantly surprised how much dust and hair this picks up as well. Comes with an app that you can tell it what to do from the app.\n",
      "Title: It is not perfect but it does the job\n",
      "Body: Upon the first trial test of this new robot mop/vac, I found that the machine has some hits and misses. Firstly, the good points: it is quiet, vacuums well, does not leave any puddles on the floor, has a long running time, has a big compartment for water containment and debris collection, and leaves the area where it cleaned a bit shinier. The bad points: it gets stuck on the edges of stairs and does not know how to turn around from stair edges, the mop does not thoroughly clean stuck on stains like dried dirt or food, and there is only one mop pad that comes with the unit so the user has to frequently use the same mop pad. I recommend this vacuum mop if you are looking for something to help you maintain a somewhat clean floor on a regular basis. I don’t think it is appropriate to use for a deep cleaner.\n",

      "Body: I am a big fan of timesaving. I love robot vacuums but this is the first time I have used one with a mop attached. It works surprisingly well. Definitely worth the price. I will use it for touchups to extend time between regular mopping. I foster animals and have 6 dogs and 6 cats. Dirty paw prints are a daily event so it is nice not to have to bend over and clean them up all the time. Let the robot do it! It's not the Jetson's Rosie but it keeps the floor clean.\n",

The vacuum works great and is slim enough to go under my cabinets and it picked up everything on the floor. I have 3 dogs and a cat so I vacuum and mop alot. I next tried out the mop adding the water and the mop attachment and it worked great! I have tile and wood floooring and it went through my living area and kitchen quickly and efficiently. I absolutely love my new robot vacuum and I highly recommend the product.\n",

I appreciated not having a roller brush to dig the pet hair out.\n",

      "Body: Play Video We’ve had this vacuum for one day, and so far, for initial impressions: - There’s no roller brush, the vacuum relies on suction to suck up dirt and debris from the floor, with the help of two side brushes. - Surprisingly, I cleaned the dustbin, and it does pick up its fair share of small debris despite not having a roller brush. - We tried it on carpet, and unfortunately it was not so great at picking up hair. So far, acceptable for a budget robot vacuum.\n",

      "Body: This is my 2nd time purchasing. Gifted the first one and got rave reviews! The product does an excellent job vacuuming. Better than a regular vacuum cleaner because it goes under your furniture to get the dust bunnies. Very quiet and efficient. Easy to set uo as well and you can even set a timer to have it work when you are away! I love it! For mopping, I only use it for my wood floors, as I like to scrub my kitchen and bathroom. I definitely recommend. You won't be disappointed!\n",
      "Title: Best Robot Vacuum for the money\n",
      "Body: I have had several robot vacuums over the years. They typically perform well enough to keep the pet hair in check but I still have to go back and mop every weekend. It was a real pleasure to discover that there is an all-in-one robot vacuum that will perform both functions. The mop is not for heavy duty cleaning like big spills or stains, you will still need some elbow grease to deal with those, but for small spills that dry and leave rings, spots, etc. It's perfect. The rotating brushes are superior to both the robot vacuums I've owned before and instead of a roller in the center, which always gets bound up with pet hair and carpet fibers, it has a port that sucks up the material into the detachable bin. This is a superior design for people who have hardwood floors and low pile carpets like area rugs around different areas of the house. You can't go wrong with this model at this price point.\n",
      "Title: Great robot cleaner that both vacuums and mops\n",
      "Body: We were looking for an additional robot vac cleaner since our original cleaner got dedicated to our craft room over the garage. Our original robot cleaner was a ROPVACNIC and we were pleased the way it vacuumed the floors, both carpet and LVP. So, we were happy to find out that they came out with a robotic cleaner that vacuums and mops. This robotic cleaner is awesome. In addition to mopping this new model has new features such as being able to control the vacuum suction and has a longer battery life. It comes with a remote or you can download an app and control the robot from your phone. Both are easy to use. The vacuum suction is more powerful on this model and my carpets look great picking up more dirt that I expected. The best part is the mop feature! Not only does it mop but it saves my back! I have a bad back and mopping the kitchen floor was always a chore. My kitchen floor looks great, so this is definitely a game changer for me. I am very pleased the results on both the carpet and tile/LVP floors. This is a great robotic cleaner and you can't beat it for the price.\n",

      "Title: Great product!\n",
      "Body: Upgraded from the regular vacuum and we love the new addition. The vacuum suction is much better and the mop keeps the floor looking fresh. We love the way it keeps our hardwood fresh and clean looking. Great product that doesn't break the bank and does what it says it does. Also the app is awesome being able to control from anywhere is Great.\n",
      "Title: Very pleased\n",
      "Body: I always thought that a robot mop was a waste of time. But I have to admit that I am pleasantly surprised with the performance of this robovacumm. Though it did take a while to clean the room, it did a great job cleaning it. I haven't set it up with the app, so I don't j know if that's why it didn't map the room. Once I do this, I will update my review. I couldn't get it to avoid my carpet, though I kind of rolled it up so it wouldn't go thru it. Other than that, I'm very satisfied. It's not loud, and it left the floor spot cleaned. Certainly recommended.\n",
      "Title: Awesome robot cleaner\n",
      "Body: Play Video I love this robot! It vacuums and mops all by itself. I can use my phone, a remote, or press a button to make it go. It’s so easy to use! It cleans while I play or sleep.

      "Body: I had another brand robot vac, but wanted to try one with mop feature. It’s much quieter than my other one & was pleasantly surprised how much the vac picked up. The mop feature is great to have between deep cleanings as well.\n",
      "Title: Vacuum and mop\n",
      "Body: I bought the vaccum when I moved in a two bed apartment 1000sqft and it did a great job on a single charge. So I decided to upgrade and buy this one with the mop feature and it works great it has more suction power compared to other vaccum mop combo with a lesser price point. It does a good job of mopping too with a single charge. I would definitely recommend this one\n",
      "Title: Great vacuum\n",
      "Body: I have an older version of this and added this to my collection! This brand truly works so well. The dust compartment is much larger than most. Connecting it to wifi look less than a minute. Super happy with my purchase\n",
      "Title: Super great cleaner!\n",
      "Body: I just used my new Robot Vacuum Cleaner G90 and I am impressed! We have two dogs who tend to get the white kitchen floor dirty and muddy. The Robot Vacuum Cleaner took care of the dirt and washed the floor! With the remote control app, I was able to steer it to do the edges and do a spot clean. It was fun to watch the Robot clean my floors while I could tend to other chores. There was plenty of water in the tank to clean the kitchen floor and the dining room floor with some left in the tank. It was easy to set up and very easy to clean. I highly recommend this product!\n",

      "Title: High quality cleaning at a fraction of the price.\n",
      "Body: This robo vacuum is the best one I have ever owned, while also being the cheapest. The unit has great suction and the mopping function is almost non existant at this price point. It also comes with extra brushes and filters that doesn't seem to be standard with other brands. I highly recommend this vacuum.\n",
      "Title: Impressive!!!\n",
      "Body: I have to admit that I was skeptical at first. I couldn't conceive how it could mop and vacuum but it does. I have always been afraid to have one because I am handicapped and I feared it would go under the bed, out of my reach. With the app and/or remote I don't have to worry about that. It works very good, it is easy to clean and the mop feature does good on my hardwood kitchen floor. I can't imagine that the more expensive robot vac/mops can do a better job.\n",
      "Title: It's worth the price.\n",
      "Body: I recently upgraded to the Tipdiy Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo, and overall, it’s been a solid addition to my cleaning routine. I live in about a 900 sq ft condo with two cats, so hair and debris are a constant challenge. The vacuum does a great job of picking up cat fur, dust, and dirt, which is a relief considering how much shedding my cats do. One thing to note is that it’s slower than its previous model. While it does a good job covering the area, it takes a bit more time to finish cleaning than my old robot vacuum. I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about this at first, but I’ve come to appreciate the trade-off because the battery life has significantly improved. It runs longer now, which means I can set it to clean and not worry about it running out of juice halfway through my condo. The mop function is also a nice touch. It doesn’t replace a deep clean, but for regular upkeep, it does a good job of handling spills and light messes, especially with the cats around. It’s easy to set up, and I love that it can switch between vacuuming and mopping automatically. Overall, while the slower pace is noticeable, the longer runtime and improved cleaning performance make up for it. If you have pets and a medium-sized space like mine then it is a solid choice for daily maintenance.\n",
      "Title: Robot Vacuum with Very Useful features\n",
      "Body: My primary reason for purchasing a robot vacuum cleaner is to control the accumulation of pet hair and dust on the floor, particularly under the table and against walls. While running the vacuum at least every other day, I can do other tasks. I am very pleased with the purchase, and the vacuum helps me to meet the pet hair control objective. The positives for this product are: *Front loading water tank and filter assembly *Changes course when encountering obstacles *Good suction of pet hairs *Different cleaning modes to apply to a variety of cleaning scenarios *Mopping function helps remove dust and very light stains *Lightweight and low noise level *Reasonably priced Cons: *The instruction booklet doesn't explicitly state how to use the mopping or spot cleaning modes *Frequent emptying of dust tank is necessary *Not programed to detect areas of very low clearance Overall, I am very satisfied with this robot vacuum. The available functions/modes are very useful for my objectives (keeping a large open area from accumulating significant pet hairs and loose dirt/dust). An example of a useful mode is in the spot cleaning mode. If there is a specific area with dirt or hairs, the vacuum can be quickly placed there for the spot cleaning mode. Then, the auto mode can be resumed. The mopping mode comes in handy to remove fine dust that is commonly tracked onto the floor (see wet streak in the video). These uses can free up time to concurrently do other tasks around the house. Finally, the vacuum is reasonably priced for the features available.\n",
