The mapping is abysmal, truly, we have run Bruce (if you can name a Shark branded robot vacuum, what other name than Bruce would you choose) 25 times, he is nowhere near mapping our house, compared to my brothers robot from a competitor who rhymes with BOOMBA, which did it in three runs. This Shark does not even play the same sport....this prevents me from doing room specific vacuuming. And that is it. Unless you have a multi story house, where this feature is a must have, set Bruce and he will clean you house. Wonderfully. Next, the not so great, Bruce is so mentally challenged. For a smart device, he is pretty dumb, but you want to know something, Bruce is determined. He will get the job done. He may have to fumble and bumble his way about, but he will get it done, and, if you watch, he does get a little smarter each time, just a little, but it is noticeable. Bruce used to do the house in large, long swaths, now he breaks it into one half of the house, then the other, and just the today, a new feature, he went around the perimeter of the house, cleaning the base boards. Small steps.As for his vacuum, top notch, perhaps too good.  Bit of advice, if you get your own Bruce, run the beast on low suction for at least the first 4 or 5 runs....another con, Bruce does not know when he has eaten too much, and like a greedy guppy, he dies...locks up and cries for help... remember, I told you Bruce is not bright, but he is a work horse. When this happens, you cannot tell Bruce to restart, he has to start over, and hopefully one of Bruce\\'s engineers will fix this, since Bruce will never know how much he has consumed, he has not the ability. Perhaps a command to send him to his base to empty himself, or a shorter duration than the 30 or so minutes it defaults to.Oh, and the base, the self empty….I am sure robot vacuums before the base were fine, if tedious, since you had to clean them every time….but the base, oh the base is pure genius. Bruce’s base is perfect, we take up with a button, and open it with a button, and never have to touch the refuse. No bag to buy, just push a button, the bottom opens  and all that stuff drops out.If you have not noticed, but this family loves Bruce, we are now looking at getting Bruce a skin, to spruce Bruce up a bit…We have had Bruce for a week now, barely, but already Bruce has made an impact. I absolute honesty I cannot recommend this product enough, it works, it has quirks, but it works, and very well.Bit of adviceTurn on all your lights until your Bruce gets a good map of the area, he is a camera based robot and needs to “see\" the ceiling, mostly, for landmarks.Run it on low the first few tries, while Bruce bounces around the first few runs, then move to medium and so on. Remember, Bruce has no sesnor in his bin, he uses a set algorithm that tells him to go back to his base and dump his load. It is terrible. But his vacuum is great, so he gets too full too fast. I can manage it a little for the quality of his cleanup.Because our house is neither toddler nor robot ready, we did not have all our rooms ready, and so we began mapping with the bedrooms and bathrooms doors closed. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, the mapping is not great, but it does move forward, slowly. Bruce stared being more efficient in our great rooms’ right about the time we added the bedrooms and bathrooms.  Our house, 3 bedroom, 2 bath, 2 great rooms and a heart kitchen, Bruce can do it on one charge now, I think because we basically added one room a day after his initial runs.I think you can tell, Bruce has been a wonderful addition to our home, truly, a robot vacuum was a luxury I didn’t think worked. It works and now I know what gift I will give every new home owner I know. There a lot of options out there, some a lot cheaper, and if those meet your needs, get them, some a lot more expensive, and aside from one specific feature Bruce does not have,( multi floor mapping)  I cannot imagine they  are better.UPDATED 2/19/20Mapping works  now, had to delete the map once , run it three times, and bang! house mapped. Room specific vacuuming unlocked! Suggestions to others having issues. Delete the map and ( and I think this part is important) run the vac with every light you can on. The robot \"see\" and makes its map on your ceiling, the more light, the better it see\\'s.To reiterate, my little robot, Bruce, has literally changed my house...cannot recommend enough.Updated 2/5/21A year later and no regrets. One of, if not, the best purchases I have made for my home. I will state again Bruce is an addition to the house and family, he is almost a pet....a very dumb, but very hard working pet....he is like a toddler...he seems to always want to be where you are... He cleans your floors and carpets...If you are on the fence about buying a robot vacuum...let me put  you at ease...buy one, this is no longer a luxury to my home, they are a requirement, utterly worth every penny. As for a Shark...I love mine. Works great, does what it is supposed to do. The only house I wouldn\\'t think this is perfect for is multi floor homes. Short of that... a must have.4/28/23 Still the best purchase we have made for our home cleaning. No change there...but a small observation...recently replaced some furniture and changed the layout of our home. We had to move the dock from a north to south orientation to an east to west...and, I swear, it now navigates even better than before.\\nRead more', 'date': '2020-02-04', 'verified_perchase': True, 'review_imgs': []}, {'reviewer_name': 'Peter Harrison', 'review_title': '\\nGreat little robot cleans all our hardwood floors. Great customer service, too.', 'rating': 5, 'review_text': 'When my wife and I downsized to a home with about 1000 square feet of living space, we knew we wanted a robot vacuum to keep the 80-year-old white oak floors clean. We wanted four things from our robot: A self-emptying dustbin and charging station, to have it connect to Alexa so we could verbally have her tell the robot to start cleaning, and to be able to tell it to go clean one or more specific rooms.Roomba and Shark both have systems that can do all those things. We chose this Shark IQ system because there were lots of reviews saying they did a better job on hard floors and because the Shark vacuum is quite a bit less expensive.We have no regrets. The Shark IQ is a great system for our needs. It will clean all six rooms on our main level and our two small hallways on a single charge, it efficiently navigates its way back to the self-empty charging base to empty its dustbin when it fills up, then returns to where it left off and finishes the job and returns to its base to empty again and recharge.Alexa integration is pretty good, too. When my wife or I leave for a long walk or to run errands we ask Alexa to, \"Tell Shark to start cleaning,\" then tell her,  \"Rosie Jetson\" (the name we gave our Shark), when she asks, \"Which robot?,\" and off Rosie goes. By the time we get back the vacuuming is done. Yay!Some reviewers have claimed their Shark was not able to map out their home\\'s floorplan. We didn\\'t have that problem. After about a week of cleaning our home Rosie Jetson had mapped our floor plan. Once that was done I spent a few minutes outlining each of our rooms in the Shark Android app, gave the rooms names (kitchen, dining room, etc.), and that was it.Once our floorplan was entered we could ask Alexa to, \"Tell Shark to clean the kitchen.\" Then, after clinging to the left wall of our living and dining room and navigating around our dining room chair legs, Rosie makes it to the kitchen, vacuums, and returns to base. Job done. Awesome!OK. Now it\\'s time to tell you the sad stuff. Rosie was not our first Shark IQ robot. The first unit we received from Amazon was a refurbished unit, and it was defective. Our first Shark would not connect to our home WiFi, so it could not communicate with Alexa, my smartphone, or map out our floorplan. We called Shark for technical support and, after trying to troubleshoot our robot for 30 minutes, Shark Tech Support declared our original unit dead-on-arrival and sent us a brand-new replacement self-emptying Shark system. The replacement works like a charm and Shark\\'s customer support was excellent.There are also some things Rosie doesn\\'t do well. She doesn\\'t sweep nto and vaccume all the way into corners and other spaces she can\\'t fit into including a cornet next to our sofa that has an end table with legs that are too close together for her, she gets tangled up in lamp and extension cords (more on that in a moment), we have a set of lightweight nesting occasional tables that she pushes around an inch or two each time she bumps into them,and my wife\\'s tennis shoes, which live under our dresser, get re-arranged and pushed to the back against the wall when she vacuums.I addressed the problem with lamp and extension cords by buying a cord protector/cover and will build a little wooden square of 1x2 furring strips to put under our dresser so my wife\\'s shoes don\\'t get pushed to the back. Simple fixes, but you should be aware that robot vacuums aren\\'t smart enough (yet) to avoid these shortcomings.So here\\'s our bottom line: We\\'re really happy with Rosie Jetson, our Shark IQ robot vacuum.Pros:* Does a great job of vacuuming our hardwood floors and the carpet mats at our two entries.* Maps the floorplans and can be told to vacuum a specific room.* Self empties its own dustbin into the charging base.* Cleanings can be scheduled using the Shark app.* Responds to voice commands to \"start cleaning\" via Alexa or Google Home.Cons:* Pushes lightweight things around sometimes.* Cannot clean into corners or tight spaces, so you\\'ll still need to vacuume manually now and them.* Dirt doesn\\'t just disappear. You have to empty the self-emptying base now and then. You also occasionally need to clean the floor brush, particularly if you have household members with long hair.* Rosie Jetson, the Robot Maid from the Saturday Morning \"Jetson\" Cartoons I grew up with, could dust, too. Our Shark robot doesn\\'t even try.Maybe next year, Shark people?\\nRead more', 'date': '2021-01-03', 'verified_perchase': True, 'review_imgs': []}]}, 'remaining_credits': 932}\n"

       "    'review_text': 'Where to start?With the bad, let us get that right out of the way. The mapping is abysmal, truly, we have run Bruce (if you can name a Shark branded robot vacuum, what other name than Bruce would you choose) 25 times, he is nowhere near mapping our house, compared to my brothers robot from a competitor who rhymes with BOOMBA, which did it in three runs. This Shark does not even play the same sport....this prevents me from doing room specific vacuuming. And that is it. Unless you have a multi story house, where this feature is a must have, set Bruce and he will clean you house. Wonderfully. Next, the not so great, Bruce is so mentally challenged. For a smart device, he is pretty dumb, but you want to know something, Bruce is determined. He will get the job done. He may have to fumble and bumble his way about, but he will get it done, and, if you watch, he does get a little smarter each time, just a little, but it is noticeable. Bruce used to do the house in large, long swaths, now he breaks it into one half of the house, then the other, and just the today, a new feature, he went around the perimeter of the house, cleaning the base boards. Small steps.As for his vacuum, top notch, perhaps too good.  Bit of advice, if you get your own Bruce, run the beast on low suction for at least the first 4 or 5 runs....another con, Bruce does not know when he has eaten too much, and like a greedy guppy, he dies...locks up and cries for help... remember, I told you Bruce is not bright, but he is a work horse. When this happens, you cannot tell Bruce to restart, he has to start over, and hopefully one of Bruce\\'s engineers will fix this, since Bruce will never know how much he has consumed, he has not the ability. Perhaps a command to send him to his base to empty himself, or a shorter duration than the 30 or so minutes it defaults to.Oh, and the base, the self empty….I am sure robot vacuums before the base were fine, if tedious, since you had to clean them every time….but the base, oh the base is pure genius. Bruce’s base is perfect, we take up with a button, and open it with a button, and never have to touch the refuse. No bag to buy, just push a button, the bottom opens  and all that stuff drops out.If you have not noticed, but this family loves Bruce, we are now looking at getting Bruce a skin, to spruce Bruce up a bit…We have had Bruce for a week now, barely, but already Bruce has made an impact. I absolute honesty I cannot recommend this product enough, it works, it has quirks, but it works, and very well.Bit of adviceTurn on all your lights until your Bruce gets a good map of the area, he is a camera based robot and needs to “see\" the ceiling, mostly, for landmarks.Run it on low the first few tries, while Bruce bounces around the first few runs, then move to medium and so on. Remember, Bruce has no sesnor in his bin, he uses a set algorithm that tells him to go back to his base and dump his load. It is terrible. But his vacuum is great, so he gets too full too fast. I can manage it a little for the quality of his cleanup.Because our house is neither toddler nor robot ready, we did not have all our rooms ready, and so we began mapping with the bedrooms and bathrooms doors closed. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, the mapping is not great, but it does move forward, slowly. Bruce stared being more efficient in our great rooms’ right about the time we added the bedrooms and bathrooms.  Our house, 3 bedroom, 2 bath, 2 great rooms and a heart kitchen, Bruce can do it on one charge now, I think because we basically added one room a day after his initial runs.I think you can tell, Bruce has been a wonderful addition to our home, truly, a robot vacuum was a luxury I didn’t think worked. It works and now I know what gift I will give every new home owner I know. There a lot of options out there, some a lot cheaper, and if those meet your needs, get them, some a lot more expensive, and aside from one specific feature Bruce does not have,( multi floor mapping)  I cannot imagine they  are better.UPDATED 2/19/20Mapping works  now, had to delete the map once , run it three times, and bang! house mapped. Room specific vacuuming unlocked! Suggestions to others having issues. Delete the map and ( and I think this part is important) run the vac with every light you can on. The robot \"see\" and makes its map on your ceiling, the more light, the better it see\\'s.To reiterate, my little robot, Bruce, has literally changed my house...cannot recommend enough.Updated 2/5/21A year later and no regrets. One of, if not, the best purchases I have made for my home. I will state again Bruce is an addition to the house and family, he is almost a pet....a very dumb, but very hard working pet....he is like a toddler...he seems to always want to be where you are... He cleans your floors and carpets...If you are on the fence about buying a robot vacuum...let me put  you at ease...buy one, this is no longer a luxury to my home, they are a requirement, utterly worth every penny. As for a Shark...I love mine. Works great, does what it is supposed to do. The only house I wouldn\\'t think this is perfect for is multi floor homes. Short of that... a must have.4/28/23 Still the best purchase we have made for our home cleaning. No change there...but a small observation...recently replaced some furniture and changed the layout of our home. We had to move the dock from a north to south orientation to an east to west...and, I swear, it now navigates even better than before.\\nRead more',\n",

       "    'review_text': 'When my wife and I downsized to a home with about 1000 square feet of living space, we knew we wanted a robot vacuum to keep the 80-year-old white oak floors clean. We wanted four things from our robot: A self-emptying dustbin and charging station, to have it connect to Alexa so we could verbally have her tell the robot to start cleaning, and to be able to tell it to go clean one or more specific rooms.Roomba and Shark both have systems that can do all those things. We chose this Shark IQ system because there were lots of reviews saying they did a better job on hard floors and because the Shark vacuum is quite a bit less expensive.We have no regrets. The Shark IQ is a great system for our needs. It will clean all six rooms on our main level and our two small hallways on a single charge, it efficiently navigates its way back to the self-empty charging base to empty its dustbin when it fills up, then returns to where it left off and finishes the job and returns to its base to empty again and recharge.Alexa integration is pretty good, too. When my wife or I leave for a long walk or to run errands we ask Alexa to, \"Tell Shark to start cleaning,\" then tell her,  \"Rosie Jetson\" (the name we gave our Shark), when she asks, \"Which robot?,\" and off Rosie goes. By the time we get back the vacuuming is done. Yay!Some reviewers have claimed their Shark was not able to map out their home\\'s floorplan. We didn\\'t have that problem. After about a week of cleaning our home Rosie Jetson had mapped our floor plan. Once that was done I spent a few minutes outlining each of our rooms in the Shark Android app, gave the rooms names (kitchen, dining room, etc.), and that was it.Once our floorplan was entered we could ask Alexa to, \"Tell Shark to clean the kitchen.\" Then, after clinging to the left wall of our living and dining room and navigating around our dining room chair legs, Rosie makes it to the kitchen, vacuums, and returns to base. Job done. Awesome!OK. Now it\\'s time to tell you the sad stuff. Rosie was not our first Shark IQ robot. The first unit we received from Amazon was a refurbished unit, and it was defective. Our first Shark would not connect to our home WiFi, so it could not communicate with Alexa, my smartphone, or map out our floorplan. We called Shark for technical support and, after trying to troubleshoot our robot for 30 minutes, Shark Tech Support declared our original unit dead-on-arrival and sent us a brand-new replacement self-emptying Shark system. The replacement works like a charm and Shark\\'s customer support was excellent.There are also some things Rosie doesn\\'t do well. She doesn\\'t sweep nto and vaccume all the way into corners and other spaces she can\\'t fit into including a cornet next to our sofa that has an end table with legs that are too close together for her, she gets tangled up in lamp and extension cords (more on that in a moment), we have a set of lightweight nesting occasional tables that she pushes around an inch or two each time she bumps into them,and my wife\\'s tennis shoes, which live under our dresser, get re-arranged and pushed to the back against the wall when she vacuums.I addressed the problem with lamp and extension cords by buying a cord protector/cover and will build a little wooden square of 1x2 furring strips to put under our dresser so my wife\\'s shoes don\\'t get pushed to the back. Simple fixes, but you should be aware that robot vacuums aren\\'t smart enough (yet) to avoid these shortcomings.So here\\'s our bottom line: We\\'re really happy with Rosie Jetson, our Shark IQ robot vacuum.Pros:* Does a great job of vacuuming our hardwood floors and the carpet mats at our two entries.* Maps the floorplans and can be told to vacuum a specific room.* Self empties its own dustbin into the charging base.* Cleanings can be scheduled using the Shark app.* Responds to voice commands to \"start cleaning\" via Alexa or Google Home.Cons:* Pushes lightweight things around sometimes.* Cannot clean into corners or tight spaces, so you\\'ll still need to vacuume manually now and them.* Dirt doesn\\'t just disappear. You have to empty the self-emptying base now and then. You also occasionally need to clean the floor brush, particularly if you have household members with long hair.* Rosie Jetson, the Robot Maid from the Saturday Morning \"Jetson\" Cartoons I grew up with, could dust, too. Our Shark robot doesn\\'t even try.Maybe next year, Shark people?\\nRead more',\n",

I especially love the automatic cutting tool for the rolling brush. The little guy docks, cuts off any threads or hairs that are wound around the brush, and gets right back to work. It's quieter than the other  two we tried, does a better job picking up debris, and using the map in various ways is simple. We got ours on sale for more than 40% off, so great little machine for the money!\",\n",

My favorite feature is that once your space is mapped you can draw on the map where you want barriers to be... For example I have two small rugs with thick pile that were causing problems so I drew a little rectangle on the map where they lay and the vacuum will avoid that space completely... No annoying rubber barriers on the floor. I love coming in to my space each morning to fresh lines on the carpet! It always goes back to it's home, I adore the self emptying (years ago I had one that didn't and that was the main complaint... Having to ptyit after nearly every session!) 10 out of 10 I highly recommend.\",\n",

       "   'review_text': 'This is my third robot vacuum, both of the other two were different brands. I fully understand robot vacuums don’t do well around obstacles such as rugs or furniture however, in the past the first one or two runs, it is easy to establish trouble areas within the household, figure out which rugs need to be picked up, etc.I have had this vacuum now for two weeks and I might as well vacuum the house manually for as much time as I spend saving this thing.I do not know that it is any shorter than my other models, but due to the suspension, it will squat and go under recliners, brace pieces On chairs and tables Only to get stuck because the brush is then pushed so far into the carpet it gets matted up.More on the small (horizontal brush) It is much longer than other models I have seen, and I think this attributes to the amount of tangling it does. Sometimes it stops the vacuum other times the brush gets tangled, and the vacuum moves on without it since it only pops on.This brush also gets caught on Every rug in the house As well as small transitions in the floor from one room to another (Other models I have seen tend to struggle with flimsy rugs or ones that don’t lay correctly, this one struggles even transitioning from hard floor to medium ply carpet.As I am writing this, it is currently trying to climb up the recliner for the third time while it cannot seem to make a successful transition when carpet is A quarter inch taller from one room to the next, it will give all of its battery life to attempt climbing over The inch and a half horizontal leg that sticks out from behind the recliner 2 inches.*** My Takeaway is that if I had not purchased this on sale, I would definitely send it back, but I did get a very good deal on it and I still have a couple more weeks to decide (I may keep it just to use for the dining room and robot proof one room of my house)This design could be improved greatly if it had two shorter horizontal  brushes instead of one long one And if The programming Was more sensitive to being stuck it would do less damage to its brush and my carpet and be easier to rescue.',\n",
