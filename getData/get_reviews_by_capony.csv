I will come back and amend a review if the item starts to fail sooner than it should4 stars: Does its job well and even surprised me5: Does its job exceptionally well and/or is more durable than what its price-point should suggest. Absolutely endorse this buyI'm not sure why this is called ""AI Ultra"" because while it does map out the area it will still try to shove its face into everything which you can hear the attempt. It often goes to an area that I don't want it to or I will have an area mapped out that i want to clean but it decides to skip it.I usually only let it vacuum while I'm home because i have to literally stop to guide it or move it off any obstacle that isn't nailed down. The suction itself is less than a handheld stick vacuum. I know this because i tested it once and I picked up even more dog hair.The water carrying compartment often leaks water which will cause problems if it gets onto the charging contact points.In less than a year I have had this replaced twice and both times have been a hassle. They did ultimately decide to replace it both times but IT IS NOT FREE. You have to pay for shipping which must be the most expensive shipping option for something that takes 3-10 to arrive.The most recent experience of troubleshooting goes like this: first call lasts about an hour of doing several things of trying to fix it which ends in recommending buying a new battery which btw IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY. They suggest that i buy a new battery. Just so everyone is aware I was quoted ~$80 to buy the battery on the phone. Amazon sells the shark branded batteries for ~$60 but there are plenty of compatible batteries online for ~$20. After purchasing the battery I called back and spent 30 mins explaining to them that I have already troubleshooted, bought and replaced the battery and still had issues. They told me that i had to go through the physical troubleshooting again so i called back the next day and DID DO TROUBLESHOOTING AGAIN. They did charge for shipping yet again which is a frustrating. Eufy is a direct competitor to this and I have had minor issues I could explain on the phone but never had me start a video call to go through a litany of troubleshooting measures. If i didn't already spend money on this unit I would switch. Might still end up switching if it breaks again after the warranty expires. FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE. If you're going to charge $400 DO BETTER.",2

                 this robot vacuum gets stuck under the simplest things like a bedroom dresser.

RB5PWJSAZC7FK,Works well,I've had this vacuum for quite a while now. Seems to work very well other than I still can not get it to connect to my Android phone. I have spoke with their customer service department and it wasn't very helpful. So I just hit the start button before I leave,4
R1VYX4KK6R8UF0,Stopped working,"I bought this vacuum in July. Absolutely loved it for a couple months… now it doesn’t work. It only cleans one 6x2 rectangle randomly in the center of our living room and then docks. I have messed with all of the setting. I have messed with map, deleted the rooms, removed no-go zones. I have factory reset everything. I have cleaned it out and wiped it down. Nothing. The only way I can get it to work is by disconnecting it from WiFi AND the app and just pushing the clean button on the top, but even then it only does a slightly larger area.

I have factory reset everything. I have cleaned it out and wiped it down. Nothing.

They suggest that i buy a new battery. Just so everyone is aware I was quoted ~$80 to buy the battery on the phone. Amazon sells the shark branded batteries for ~$60 but there are plenty of compatible batteries online for ~$20. After purchasing the battery I called back and spent 30 mins explaining to them that I have already troubleshooted, bought and replaced the battery and still had issues. They told me that i had to go through the physical troubleshooting again so i called back the next day and DID DO TROUBLESHOOTING AGAIN. They did charge for shipping yet again which is a frustrating. Eufy is a direct competitor to this and I have had minor issues I could explain on the phone but never had me start a video call to go through a litany of troubleshooting measures.

It only cleans one 6x2 rectangle randomly in the center of our living room and then docks. I have messed with all of the setting. I have messed with map, deleted the rooms, removed no-go zones. I have factory reset everything. I have cleaned it out and wiped it down. Nothing.

Absolutely endorse this buyI'm not sure why this is called ""AI Ultra"" because while it does map out the area it will still try to shove its face into everything which you can hear the attempt. It often goes to an area that I don't want it to or I will have an area mapped out that i want to clean but it decides to skip it.I usually only let it vacuum while I'm home because i have to literally stop to guide it or move it off any obstacle that isn't nailed down. The suction itself is less than a handheld stick vacuum. I know this because i tested it once and I picked up even more dog hair.The water carrying compartment often leaks water which will cause problems if it gets onto the charging contact points.In less than a year I have had this replaced twice and both times have been a hassle. They did ultimately decide to replace it both times but IT IS NOT FREE. You have to pay for shipping which must be the most expensive shipping option for something that takes 3-10 to arrive.The most recent experience of troubleshooting goes like this: first call lasts about an hour of doing several things of trying to fix it which ends in recommending buying a new battery which btw IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY. They suggest that i buy a new battery. Just so everyone is aware I was quoted ~$80 to buy the battery on the phone. Amazon sells the shark branded batteries for ~$60 but there are plenty of compatible batteries online for ~$20. After purchasing the battery I called back and spent 30 mins explaining to them that I have already troubleshooted, bought and replaced the battery and still had issues. They told me that i had to go through the physical troubleshooting again so i called back the next day and DID DO TROUBLESHOOTING AGAIN. They did charge for shipping yet again which is a frustrating. Eufy is a direct competitor to this and I have had minor issues I could explain on the phone but never had me start a video call to go through a litany of troubleshooting measures. If i didn't already spend money on this unit I would switch. Might still end up switching if it breaks again after the warranty expires. FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE. If you're going to charge $400 DO BETTER.",2

After purchasing the battery I called back and spent 30 mins explaining to them that I have already troubleshooted, bought and replaced the battery and still had issues. They told me that i had to go through the physical troubleshooting again so i called back the next day and DID DO TROUBLESHOOTING AGAIN. They did charge for shipping yet again which is a frustrating. Eufy is a direct competitor to this and I have had minor issues I could explain on the phone but never had me start a video call to go through a litany of troubleshooting measures. If i didn't already spend money on this unit I would switch. Might still end up switching if it breaks again after the warranty expires. FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE.

You have to pay for shipping which must be the most expensive shipping option for something that takes 3-10 to arrive.The most recent experience of troubleshooting goes like this: first call lasts about an hour of doing several things of trying to fix it which ends in recommending buying a new battery which btw IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY. They suggest that i buy a new battery. Just so everyone is aware I was quoted ~$80 to buy the battery on the phone. Amazon sells the shark branded batteries for ~$60 but there are plenty of compatible batteries online for ~$20. After purchasing the battery I called back and spent 30 mins explaining to them that I have already troubleshooted, bought and replaced the battery and still had issues. They told me that i had to go through the physical troubleshooting again so i called back the next day and DID DO TROUBLESHOOTING AGAIN. They did charge for shipping yet again which is a frustrating. Eufy is a direct competitor to this and I have had minor issues I could explain on the phone but never had me start a video call to go through a litany of troubleshooting measures. If i didn't already spend money on this unit I would switch. Might still end up switching if it breaks again after the warranty expires. FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE.

It often goes to an area that I don't want it to or I will have an area mapped out that i want to clean but it decides to skip it.I usually only let it vacuum while I'm home because i have to literally stop to guide it or move it off any obstacle that isn't nailed down. The suction itself is less than a handheld stick vacuum. I know this because i tested it once and I picked up even more dog hair.The water carrying compartment often leaks water which will cause problems if it gets onto the charging contact points.In less than a year I have had this replaced twice and both times have been a hassle. They did ultimately decide to replace it both times but IT IS NOT FREE. You have to pay for shipping which must be the most expensive shipping option for something that takes 3-10 to arrive.The most recent experience of troubleshooting goes like this: first call lasts about an hour of doing several things of trying to fix it which ends in recommending buying a new battery which btw IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY. They suggest that i buy a new battery. Just so everyone is aware I was quoted ~$80 to buy the battery on the phone. Amazon sells the shark branded batteries for ~$60 but there are plenty of compatible batteries online for ~$20. After purchasing the battery I called back and spent 30 mins explaining to them that I have already troubleshooted, bought and replaced the battery and still had issues. They told me that i had to go through the physical troubleshooting again so i called back the next day and DID DO TROUBLESHOOTING AGAIN. They did charge for shipping yet again which is a frustrating. Eufy is a direct competitor to this and I have had minor issues I could explain on the phone but never had me start a video call to go through a litany of troubleshooting measures. If i didn't already spend money on this unit I would switch. Might still end up switching if it breaks again after the warranty expires. FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE.

They suggest that i buy a new battery. Just so everyone is aware I was quoted ~$80 to buy the battery on the phone. Amazon sells the shark branded batteries for ~$60 but there are plenty of compatible batteries online for ~$20. After purchasing the battery I called back and spent 30 mins explaining to them that I have already troubleshooted, bought and replaced the battery and still had issues. They told me that i had to go through the physical troubleshooting again so i called back the next day and DID DO TROUBLESHOOTING AGAIN. They did charge for shipping yet again which is a frustrating. Eufy is a direct competitor to this and I have had minor issues I could explain on the phone but never had me start a video call to go through a litany of troubleshooting measures. If i didn't already spend money on this unit I would switch. Might still end up switching if it breaks again after the warranty expires. FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE.

I have factory reset everything. I have cleaned it out and wiped it down. Nothing.

They suggest that i buy a new battery. Just so everyone is aware I was quoted ~$80 to buy the battery on the phone. Amazon sells the shark branded batteries for ~$60 but there are plenty of compatible batteries online for ~$20. After purchasing the battery I called back and spent 30 mins explaining to them that I have already troubleshooted, bought and replaced the battery and still had issues. They told me that i had to go through the physical troubleshooting again so i called back the next day and DID DO TROUBLESHOOTING AGAIN. They did charge for shipping yet again which is a frustrating. Eufy is a direct competitor to this and I have had minor issues I could explain on the phone but never had me start a video call to go through a litany of troubleshooting measures.

It only cleans one 6x2 rectangle randomly in the center of our living room and then docks. I have messed with all of the setting. I have messed with map, deleted the rooms, removed no-go zones. I have factory reset everything. I have cleaned it out and wiped it down. Nothing.

Absolutely endorse this buyI'm not sure why this is called ""AI Ultra"" because while it does map out the area it will still try to shove its face into everything which you can hear the attempt. It often goes to an area that I don't want it to or I will have an area mapped out that i want to clean but it decides to skip it.I usually only let it vacuum while I'm home because i have to literally stop to guide it or move it off any obstacle that isn't nailed down. The suction itself is less than a handheld stick vacuum. I know this because i tested it once and I picked up even more dog hair.The water carrying compartment often leaks water which will cause problems if it gets onto the charging contact points.In less than a year I have had this replaced twice and both times have been a hassle. They did ultimately decide to replace it both times but IT IS NOT FREE. You have to pay for shipping which must be the most expensive shipping option for something that takes 3-10 to arrive.The most recent experience of troubleshooting goes like this: first call lasts about an hour of doing several things of trying to fix it which ends in recommending buying a new battery which btw IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY. They suggest that i buy a new battery. Just so everyone is aware I was quoted ~$80 to buy the battery on the phone. Amazon sells the shark branded batteries for ~$60 but there are plenty of compatible batteries online for ~$20. After purchasing the battery I called back and spent 30 mins explaining to them that I have already troubleshooted, bought and replaced the battery and still had issues. They told me that i had to go through the physical troubleshooting again so i called back the next day and DID DO TROUBLESHOOTING AGAIN. They did charge for shipping yet again which is a frustrating. Eufy is a direct competitor to this and I have had minor issues I could explain on the phone but never had me start a video call to go through a litany of troubleshooting measures. If i didn't already spend money on this unit I would switch. Might still end up switching if it breaks again after the warranty expires. FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE. If you're going to charge $400 DO BETTER.",2

After purchasing the battery I called back and spent 30 mins explaining to them that I have already troubleshooted, bought and replaced the battery and still had issues. They told me that i had to go through the physical troubleshooting again so i called back the next day and DID DO TROUBLESHOOTING AGAIN. They did charge for shipping yet again which is a frustrating. Eufy is a direct competitor to this and I have had minor issues I could explain on the phone but never had me start a video call to go through a litany of troubleshooting measures. If i didn't already spend money on this unit I would switch. Might still end up switching if it breaks again after the warranty expires. FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE.

You have to pay for shipping which must be the most expensive shipping option for something that takes 3-10 to arrive.The most recent experience of troubleshooting goes like this: first call lasts about an hour of doing several things of trying to fix it which ends in recommending buying a new battery which btw IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY. They suggest that i buy a new battery. Just so everyone is aware I was quoted ~$80 to buy the battery on the phone. Amazon sells the shark branded batteries for ~$60 but there are plenty of compatible batteries online for ~$20. After purchasing the battery I called back and spent 30 mins explaining to them that I have already troubleshooted, bought and replaced the battery and still had issues. They told me that i had to go through the physical troubleshooting again so i called back the next day and DID DO TROUBLESHOOTING AGAIN. They did charge for shipping yet again which is a frustrating. Eufy is a direct competitor to this and I have had minor issues I could explain on the phone but never had me start a video call to go through a litany of troubleshooting measures. If i didn't already spend money on this unit I would switch. Might still end up switching if it breaks again after the warranty expires. FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE.

It often goes to an area that I don't want it to or I will have an area mapped out that i want to clean but it decides to skip it.I usually only let it vacuum while I'm home because i have to literally stop to guide it or move it off any obstacle that isn't nailed down. The suction itself is less than a handheld stick vacuum. I know this because i tested it once and I picked up even more dog hair.The water carrying compartment often leaks water which will cause problems if it gets onto the charging contact points.In less than a year I have had this replaced twice and both times have been a hassle. They did ultimately decide to replace it both times but IT IS NOT FREE. You have to pay for shipping which must be the most expensive shipping option for something that takes 3-10 to arrive.The most recent experience of troubleshooting goes like this: first call lasts about an hour of doing several things of trying to fix it which ends in recommending buying a new battery which btw IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY. They suggest that i buy a new battery. Just so everyone is aware I was quoted ~$80 to buy the battery on the phone. Amazon sells the shark branded batteries for ~$60 but there are plenty of compatible batteries online for ~$20. After purchasing the battery I called back and spent 30 mins explaining to them that I have already troubleshooted, bought and replaced the battery and still had issues. They told me that i had to go through the physical troubleshooting again so i called back the next day and DID DO TROUBLESHOOTING AGAIN. They did charge for shipping yet again which is a frustrating. Eufy is a direct competitor to this and I have had minor issues I could explain on the phone but never had me start a video call to go through a litany of troubleshooting measures. If i didn't already spend money on this unit I would switch. Might still end up switching if it breaks again after the warranty expires. FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE.

R1RF6ZQB0IA07,A glitch in the Matrix,"Buggy software. Once, it decided to vacuum at 2:30am, waking up the entire family. Today, it cleaned 2 square feet and returned to base, despite being asked to vacuum several rooms (see photo). After mapping your whole house, if you move some furniture there's no way to re-map just one room -- you have to re-map the whole house, which means picking up EVERYTHING first. Cleaning performance is decent, but it lacks the air puff feature to get dust out of corners. The rotating brushes get snagged on even medium area rugs, had to buy replacements. If you have a shag area rug, you can exclude it on the map by dragging and pinching, but it's impossible to get the region exactly right so you'll have a foot around the rug which never gets cleaned, or the vacuum tries to clean the edge of the rug and gets snagged. Finally, Shark plays games with pricing, and the 50% off price is the rule not the exception. Worth it at 299, but there are better options.",2

R1124EFEQ8SUM7,Waste of time,"I was so excited to finally get one of these, but that was short lived. The app is a joke and doesn’t work well. Vaccum will not matrix clean any room on the first attempt. When I send the vacuum out it turns around quickly and goes back to the dock. On the off chance the vacuum makes it off the dock ther is a high probability it wont make it back. Unfortunately I’m out of the return period otherwise this piece of crap would be going back instead of going in the trash. $300 in the trash can.",1
R3291FLDREET06,Waste of money - do not buy if you have lots of pet hair,"I bought this to replace a cheap robovac that finally died. Loved the upgrade on this one that it self emptied. Well what a complete waste of money! Pet hair clogs it up pretty quickly. It actually deposits tufts of per hair on edges of rugs etc. they are actually worse after vacuuming. It’s supposed to not have to be cleaned or emptied for a month, but I have to clean it every time it runs. It does a decent job on just dirt on hard floors, but seems to do next to nothing on my rugs, and like I said, actually leaves rugs dirtier. I wish I could return it or sell it. The only reason I haven’t just tossed it in the trash is because it was so expensive. Don’t waste your money if you have shedding pets!!",1
