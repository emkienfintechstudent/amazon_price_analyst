      "Title: Doesn‚Äôt work\n",
      "Body: This came, did not work so I sent it back after the seller never replied. Had to speak to Amazon support 4 times since it kept saying return denied. Then they charged a $127 restocking fee. Do not buy from this seller\n",
      "Title: Waste of time\n",
      "Body: I was so excited to finally get one of these, but that was short lived. The app is a joke and doesn‚Äôt work well. Vaccum will not matrix clean any room on the first attempt. When I send the vacuum out it turns around quickly and goes back to the dock. On the off chance the vacuum makes it off the dock ther is a high probability it wont make it back. Unfortunately I‚Äôm out of the return period otherwise this piece of crap would be going back instead of going in the trash. $300 in the trash can.\n",
      "Title: Waste of money - do not buy if you have lots of pet hair\n",
      "Body: I bought this to replace a cheap robovac that finally died. Loved the upgrade on this one that it self emptied. Well what a complete waste of money! Pet hair clogs it up pretty quickly. It actually deposits tufts of per hair on edges of rugs etc. they are actually worse after vacuuming. It‚Äôs supposed to not have to be cleaned or emptied for a month, but I have to clean it every time it runs. It does a decent job on just dirt on hard floors, but seems to do next to nothing on my rugs, and like I said, actually leaves rugs dirtier. I wish I could return it or sell it. The only reason I haven‚Äôt just tossed it in the trash is because it was so expensive. Don‚Äôt waste your money if you have shedding pets!!\n",
      "Title: Obnoxiously loud\n",
      "Body: Play Video\n",
      "Clunky and loud.\n",
      "Title: So far a terrible ptoduct\n",
      "Body: There is no instruction book. The map setup misses door openings as well as the 20 foot opening between kitchen and living room. This far I have not found online nor by fiddling with remapping ANY INSTRUCTION S how do make the shark clean more than 122 sq feet. Currently its a failure of a product.\n",
      "Title: Not \"very good\"\n",
      "Body: List as \"very good\" condition, but came with a bad cliff sensor which makes it not be able to function. Maybe check and see if the device works before you say it's condition is \"very good\". I am now trying to track down a replacement sensor, which has not been easy so far. Do not trust this seller!\n",

      "Title: It is not pet friendly.\n",
      "Body: We purchased this vacuum because we have dogs that shed. We have used it for less than 5 months and it has thrown an error code stating that the brush roller isn't working. I do not recommend this product.\n",
      "Title: The Inbred 4th Cousin of iRoomba\n",
      "Body: this robot vacuum gets stuck under the simplest things like a bedroom dresser. The funnier thing is, it will go behind the door of the bedroom and shut itself off on the doorstop unless I block the spring doorstop. That‚Äôs right, it actually turns its own power button off every single time on that doorstop.\n",
      "Title: Wouldn't buy again\n",
      "Body: It was a good idea. Wouldn't buy again. After having 2 years, it no longer works.\n",
      "Title: Stopped working\n",
      "Body: I bought this vacuum in July. Absolutely loved it for a couple months‚Ä¶ now it doesn‚Äôt work. It only cleans one 6x2 rectangle randomly in the center of our living room and then docks. I have messed with all of the setting. I have messed with map, deleted the rooms, removed no-go zones. I have factory reset everything. I have cleaned it out and wiped it down. Nothing. The only way I can get it to work is by disconnecting it from WiFi AND the app and just pushing the clean button on the top, but even then it only does a slightly larger area. So disappointing especially after spending so much and loving it at first.\n",
      "Title: Great while it lasted\n",
      "Body: Great than after a few months quit charging.\n",
      "Title: It‚Äôs loud\n",
      "Body: I bought this to replace what I had with the same type because my old one ran into poo where I had a guest dog and gross ‚Ä¶ but the new one is loud ‚Ä¶ like really loud and makes a clicking noise. Not happy at all about it but so far it works üòë\n",
      "Title: Disappointed\n",
      "Body: Problem with mapping and cleaning progress cant be seen in maps. Poor suction power.\n",
      "Title: Loud doesn‚Äôt empty properly\n",
      "Body: The dirt always plugs up so it won‚Äôt empty into bin\n",
      "Title: Worked 3 times\n",
      "Body: It worked three times and stopped working. Live Assist is also very busy so it is difficult to get them. However, once you get a representative then they can be helpful.\n",
      "Title: Junk vacuum. Doesn‚Äôt deserve even one star.\n",
      "Body: This is the second remote vacuum we‚Äôve owned and it is the worst. It does not pick up dirt very well. It misses spots. It gets stuck on the wooden vents and edges of thicker area rugs. Wish we had bought the IRobot again. No wonder this one was on sale. Just missed the 30 day return window. We do not recommend this vacuum.\n",
      "Title: Totally useless\n",
      "Body: we bought the Shark mainly for its mapping feature: this totally fails and robot goes into the no go zone each time.\n",
      "Every time it runs one of the brushes falls off, mainly when it goes from a rug to tile .\n",
      "The run time is @30 minutes.Ridiculous.\n",

      "Do not buy a Sharkproduct is the short advice.\n",
      "Title: IShark robot\n",
      "Body: If you have dogs don't buy it. I have used roomba exclusively. I have a Shark Rotator Professional vacuum and I just love it. I thought I would try the Shark iRobot but I hate it. The unit sucks. I have two dogs, a Boxer mix & a Doberman Lab mix. The machine can't handle the hair and I run it daily. It only has one roller and a brush in back of the roller which causes the hair to pile up on it. I had to go back to roomba.\n",
      "Title: Don't waste your money\n",
      "Body: This is the third robot vacuum we've had, and it's the worst one yet. I thought a name brand one would be better, it isn't. Tried giving it time thinking the mapping would get better, it didn't. Constantly needing to relearn. It doesn't detect anything to avoid.\n",
      "Title: after three machines none seem to work very long\n",
      "Body: Purchased this Shark machine on 3-2-2024 replaced it twice and they are trying to replace it now with a new machine on 10-30-2024. I had to agree to wait 2 weeks even though I can buy one on Amazon and have it delivered in about three days. Just lets you know what Shark thinks about the existing customer. Just get the next fool on the line and reel him or her in. It is all about the MONEY not taking care of the customer. The next shark I see will be on the end of a line in water.\n",
      "Title: Started having issues after 6 months of daily use\n",
      "Body: I'm just listing 2 of the major issues; 1. The vacuum started stopping elsewhere (no obstruction on the floor or stucked objects or even after cleaning) on the room without completing its job. It normally docks when running out of battery but over time it started once a week until almost every day. 2. Vacuum started acting and not charging while docked unless you apply a little pressure on top of the vacuum closer to the charging terminal post. The docking station did not move and once in awhile it charges but most of the time it won't. It's acting like a loose contact.\n",
      "Title: Side wheels fell off\n",
      "Body: Side wheels fell off and have no idea where to buy them. Lasted about a month\n",
      "Title: Worked beautifully for about 2 weeks & hasn't worked right since\n",
      "Body: This vacuum worked beautifully for about 2 weeks & hasn't worked right since. I had it scheduled to run each morning on my main level & all was fine until it started throwing out an error code about 2 weeks in. I took the roller out, cleaned it off (even though it was not at all jammed as the error was indicating) and it still wouldn't run. I ordered a kit of replacement parts thinking maybe the roller that it came with was bad and it worked again for maybe 3-4 days then the same error came up. Took everything apart, cleaned again & now its just a pricey floor decoration because it will not run due to the \"jammed roller\" that is not jammed at all.\n",
      "Title: Side brush stuck error of death\n",
      "Body: Bought it in January and side brush motor already burnt out. Cant replace and Shark won‚Äôt accept warranty because it wasn‚Äôt purchased from an authorized dealer. Update; called shark back today and they approved the warranty.\n",
      "Title: Disgusting!\n",
      "Body: Bought this vacuum and was sent this DISGUSTING vacuum PLEASE SEE PICTURES. It full of Very thick dust, hair and all kinds of filthy thing! Absolutely disgusting! I cant believe this thing was even sent out, it belongs in the dumpster and should be burned! AGAIN SEE PICTURES\n",
      "Title: Don‚Äôt bother\n",
      "Body: This is the worst machine that was ever built. Its app is completely unstable, and as soon as you get it, set up and behaving as you‚Äôd like, it no longer remembers you and you have to set it up all over again. Dysfunctionality is fine, if it actually effing worked on a regular basis. But because of its inability to continue after initialp set up makes this a colossal waste of money\n",
      "Title: Doesn't last 2 years\n",
      "Body: My robot has been stuck on \"error number 2\" for some time now. Sometimes if we grease the wheels or help the brushes move as it first starts it'll run, but most of the time it doesn't anymore. So Disappointed. A Google search will tell you that this is a common error. They clearly haven't perfected the machine yet and it shouldn't be for sale until they do.\n",
      "Title: Doesn't live up to the hype\n",
      "Body: I have to say, I have had this vacuum for 5 months and it does an ok job vacuuming the floors but to this day still does not have a map of the house, one of the main requirements I had in buying it. I have given it time like support posts but it's not developing and I have given up trying to get it fixed. I will gift this to someone as a first robo vac this December as I will be replacing it with another Roomba\n",
      "Title: It‚Äôs not going to give out while under warranty\n",
      "Body: It works good enough if you‚Äôre aren‚Äôt perfectionistic. But I neglected to charge it after a few months in the winter because I mostly used it in the sunroom, which we don‚Äôt use in the winter. I did replace brushes, the beater bar, filters, anything that came in the kit I bought. Well, it stopped charging altogether. I have yet to try a new battery but sheeze! For the dough we plunked down, you would think a little break wouldn‚Äôt kill the dang thing! I say look elsewhere. I can‚Äôt justify NOT getting my money‚Äôs worth for quite a while. A dud for sure.\n",
      "Title: Beware of warranty\n",
      "Body: The unit died a few months after the 1 year mark. Of course the warranty is only for a year, and nothing can be done after the warranty. For the money spent on this product, I would expect it to last more than a year and a few months.\n",
      "Title: Shark Ai\n",
      "Body: Says has Ai included to avoided objects. First day and it ran over a pile of dog poop and smeared it all over.. also will just push the dog food bowl around the house, definitely no attempt to even avoid. So in my short experience the AI detection doesn‚Äôt work at all\n",
      "Title: Does not return to home\n",
      "Body: This vacuum came defective and would not return to its base after running in my home. I returned the vacuum after one use with its original packaging including the original box all the plastic that came with I did not throw away anything and I packaged it up the way it came. But the seller charged me a 20% restocking fee. I paid over $400 for the vacuum and only received a refund of $350. Terrible service will not buy a shark again.\n",
      "Title: Fail!\n",
      "Body: Sharkira saved our lives at the beginning. We‚Äôve had her for a little under 6 months (2 months of which we didn‚Äôt use her due to a renovation). She dies in the middle of the house, makes a terrible rattling sound despite being clean as a whistle, and empties all of the contents on the floor when you try to return it to the charging station after dying mid-clean. Incredibly disheartening.\n",
      "Title: It does not track where it has vacuumed and seems to pick different rooms every night\n",
      "Body: Again, I don‚Äôt like the fact that it doesn‚Äôt track where it has been other than the reports confirmed for to the next day. One day. It will vacuum one room the next day I‚Äôll vacuum two rooms the next day to vacuum one room again the next day to vacuum three rooms.\n",
      "Title: Doesn‚Äôt re dock to charge\n",
      "Body: This Robo vac has a very hard time staying on the dock and staying charged. I do have a dog in toddles, but if you see the video the vacuum did not even seem to moved, and it was not charged. I had to tap it for it to like wake up and recharge. When it vacuums it vacuums really good, but to be honest, the charging is an issue I think if I could, I would return it.\n",
      "Title: Don‚Äôt Waste Your Money\n",
      "Body: I originally bought the all white unit back in July 2024, by September 2024 the robot was already not working. I tried to troubleshoot with Shark and when that didn‚Äôt work they sent me a replacement robot as my unit is still under warranty. It‚Äôs been a few weeks running the replacement unit and it is also not operating correctly. It‚Äôs always missing sections of my home now. I have tried troubleshooting and remapping my home with no success. Neither Amazon or Shark will issue me a refund for this defective product. There is only a 30 day return window so Amazon will not honor a return even though I have had this item for less than 90 days. So I‚Äôm just stuck with a product that doesn‚Äôt work. Save your money!\n",
      "Title: Not durable and poor mapping\n",
      "Body: This unit has always had one problem or another. As a result it would vacuum on occasion, but not at all reliably. The biggest problem is that after about 6 months (1-2 months of which it didn't run at all), it started regularly giving errors about the bumper being stuck. Yes there is a process to clean the sensors. However i started having to do this in about a weekly basis. Also since it has never really mapped out my house, I eventually test the map for it to remap from scratch. Since then it has never been able to actually create a new map and just drives aimlessly. The dust bin says it is full when it is not, so it stops randomly if it hasn't already stopped fit the \"stuck bumper\". Just completely useless for what was paid for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm really frustrated as we live in the country with time floors and when it worked, it was great for picking up the daily sand and dirt that gets tracked in from us and the pets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: I've reduced it to one star. It has been failing with even more issues and it is effectively completely non-functional. The front bumper has a shield that has fallen out, so the sensors are now exposed, and seem to also be failing. Also after moving the base location to allow it to be more central in the house, it failed to generate a new map. Now after having had it powered off for a month, I went to try setting it up again, and the app has forgotten the robot, and can't even reestablish a Wi-Fi connection even though everything else is working fine. Absolute trash in less than a year. I've debated trying a different brand, but I think this may have just put me off these things all together.\n",
      "Title: JUNK\n",
      "Body: DO NOT BUY! This robot has been abysmal in cleaning, mapping, and challenges. The company replaced all the inners (battery, etc.) WITHIN THE FIRST 30 DAYS. They even said that since I bought the warranty from Amazon, their warranty was null and void, which is ridiculous. They also charged for the new parts. I called for support when it started ignoring the map settings AGAIN. I was told they would transfer me. Seven minutes into the call with the same person, they asked me a question about the version of the app. There had been an update the day prior, I was unaware and I asked them if this would fix the problem. They said no, they would have to transfer me (second time they have said this to me). I continued to wait, and they never transferred me to a technician to help. After 10 minutes, I gave up. DON'T BUY IT DOESN'T WORK, AND THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS NON-EXISTENT!\n",
      "Title: Do not buy a Shark Vacuum\n",
      "Body: I've been using my Shark vacuum for about a month, and now it's giving me an error code related to the front bumper. The machine isn't working at all. I live in a small house with laminate flooring‚Äîno carpet and no animals. I've followed all the recommendations I found on YouTube for clearing the front bumper, but nothing seems to work. This is my third Shark vacuum, and honestly, they don't seem to last very long. I'm getting pretty frustrated! Any help would be appreciated -\n",
      "Title: Awful robot and service\n",
      "Body: Mine broke in 1.5 years and it is so expensive for shut a faulty machine. When I called Shark they said my warranty had passed and I can buy a new one. Terrible product and service. I will never buy a Shark again.\n",
      "Title: Waste of money\n",
      "Body: Didn‚Äôt last long but unfortunately couldn‚Äôt return it. Always malfunctioning, getting caught on furniture, not docking. It was a waste of money.\n",
      "Title: Spinner\n",
      "Body: I have replaced the spinners twice they do not stay on\n",
      "Title: Nope! Horrible experience.\n",
      "Body: I bought this vaccum in July and loved it. Loved everything about it. Then Helene hit. We lost power and internet for a week. I then spent 8 hours over the course of 4 days on the phone with the help desk trying to get it back on-line. It will no longer recognize my router, it says password incorrect. Which is not true. The last tech support fellow, even sent me a beta app for this issue and informed me that if the power is out more than 3 hours this will happen again, if I don't download the spectrum app and change my router password. That was all a bridge to far for me. 2 more hours on the phone to change more passwords load more apps and for nothing. I didn't need the spectrum app when I install it fresh from the box and The password wasn't a problem then either and he could t tell me why now. I asked them to replace my 3 month old robot and they were not willing. This thing is very expensive, unsupportable, hot garbage. I'm going to buy a Hoover now.\n",
      "Title: I hate this vacuum, constantly breaks\n",
      "Body: I absolutely hate this vacuum and it was a complete waste of $250. Less than a year into owning it stopped running the blueprint of our house and would only go to \"living room\". 5 feet from anything in any direction. After working with Shark on repeatedly phone calls to reset the firmware it worked again for about a month. Then it went completely dead all together unable to detect that it was on the charger and unable to charge at all. One day this week it sparatically turned on again and charged. Once again it only detects \"living room\" and not the other 3 rooms. This thing is a complete piece of garbage.\n",
      "Title: Not good with pet hair!!\n",
      "Body: I bought this mainly for pet hair. Its supposed to have the tangle free roller. From day 1 I would have to go around the house and pick up piles of dog hair. 2 weeks in and I came home to the device dead on the floor and the roller stopped up. There wasn't anything in the bin. Don't bother with this. It's too expensive to be so ineffective.\n",
      "Title: Quit working soon after purchase\n",
      "Body: I am so disappointed in this product. It quit working only after 3 uses. The times it did work I had to monitor it because it would get ‚Äústuck‚Äù and stop. I‚Äôll probably never again buy a shark product.\n",
      "Title: Buggy Firmware\n",
      "Body: The convenience of this product is great, if only it would work properly. It frequently tries to run outside of the scheduled hours, even at 3am for example. I‚Äôve had to resort to using smart plugs to disable it in the evening. Even then, it‚Äôs impossible to keep this product running on a consistent schedule. This seems to be a major firmware bug with no way to update it.\n",
      "Title: Worked decently for 2 whole months before it quit\n",
      "Body: For two months, I loved this robot vac. It worked great, picked up tons of dog hair and made my life easier. Until it didn't. It now gives the \"disconnected\" message, I've tried reconnecting, and so far nothing works. I will now try connecting through a \"new robot\" process and if that works I will upgrade my rating to two stars and no more, since I feel I shouldn't have to do that process with a fairly new purchase.\n",
      "Title: Horrible\n",
      "Body: Don‚Äôt waste your money lasted almost a month\n",
      "Title: Poor excuse for a smart robot\n",
      "Body: Ove the past three years, this Shark robot has constantly disappointed. It gets lost and rarely goes to specific rooms like the kitchen. Instead it chooses to do the whole floor.\n",
      "Title: Doesn't work\n",
      "Body: Battery runs out very quickly, doesn't work at all.\n",
      "I gave it the benefit or the doubt, and kept it longer than I should\n",
      "Title: Best to Avoid\n",
      "Body: This waste of hundreds of dollars functioned properly approximately 5 times before giving a ‚Äúdust cup error‚Äù. I‚Äôve reinstalled the dust bin properly and fully cleaned the filter, however it is still giving the error. Attempts to contact Shark regarding this issue have been about as successful as clearing this error. I highly recommend looking elsewhere if you are in the market for a robot vacuum!\n",
      "Title: Engine damage in less than 2 years!!!\n",
      "Body: It worked for 1 year and 10 months only, then stopped working! I called Shark customer service and was told to do few things, then was told the engine is damaged and I have to buy a new one!!! I live alone, no kids, no pets and was using it once a week!! It didn't even last 2 years, very poor quality!!!\n",
      "Title: Worst robot vacuum I've ever owned\n",
      "Body: This had great reviews and I caught it on sale, but very quickly it became apparent the vacuum was vastly inferior to other models I've used. In a year it's been inert a majority of the time, because when it runs it's bad at vacuuming, it gets stuck on the tiniest rug edge, can't come close to a bathroom rug without eating it and dying, and gives constant errors. Now with the latest app update it's completely inoperable. Based on cost and usage I probably paid about $5 per hour of operation for this utterly worthless product. Hard do not recommend.\n",
      "Title: After 3 months to the day ready to throw it out\n",
      "Body: At first she worked like a charm. Then she started to forget where her base was. Now she wanders aimlessly looking for home until she runs out of juice and I have to go in search of her.\n",
      "Title: Serial Number scratched out\n",
      "Body: This ‚Äúnew‚Äù product arrived jumbled in the box. Appeared to have been previously opened. There were no instructions. After further inspection, the serial number on the bottom of the unit was scratched out.\n",
      "Title: Don't buy\n",
      "Body: Stopped working after only months of use. It either says move to a new location, move to flat surface (which it's on the ground!), or just spins in circles. Wouldn't recommend\n",
      "Title: Doesn‚Äôt work and customer service is entirely unhelpful\n",
      "Body: It doesn‚Äôt work on pet hair for carpets which is the main reason I purchased. It then stopped working all together and after a very unhelpful 30 minute wait listening to the most annoying voice recording I have ever heard approximately 100 times, a very unhelpful person informed me it was my fault for not knowing that in addition to regularly cleaning the brush roll I‚Äôd have to also pull out the pin which was stuck to its base. Because I ordered this thing on AMAZON shark wouldn‚Äôt replace the brush roll so after spending over $300 on a machine that is over $500 full price, I will have to replace the brush roll for a vacuum cleaner that doesn‚Äôt work for the primary purpose I purchased it for. 0 stars. I guess I‚Äôll get one of the even move expensive robots next time. Very frustrating experience with the shark brand and I will not be purchasing any of their products in the future.\n",
      "Title: Not AI and does not last long\n",
      "Body: We've had this device for about three months and it initially cleaned okay, but the feature that limits its cleaning area didn't really work. Instead of cleaning only the necessary area, it cleaned the whole area every time, which was more than I needed. Then, suddenly, it stopped working. It took us quite a while to figure out how to get it to display an error message, which allowed us to identify the issue. It turned out that a small piece of hair was causing the problem. Unfortunately, by the time we found the issue, it was past the return window.\n",
      "Title: Never worked.\n",
      "Body: Received in durable packaging. Not damaged. Defective. Never worked. Switched out for cheaper brand that works well.\n",

      "Total garbage\n",
      "No help from customer service\n",
      "Title: Too many error messages!\n",
      "Body: I am having a continuous error message \"I can't empty debris into the dock\" I've cleaned it, rebooted it and can't eliminate the error for several months. I want to return it. I purchased it 10/10/23. I am finished with this!\n",
      "Title: Just bought 2 months ago, used less than 10 times, broken\n",
      "Body: I bought this machine on amazon prime day (July 2024). I used less than 10 times. Just a random day I want to use it again and it pop up with error message (error 6, bumper stuck). I followed the instruction on the guide for troubleshooting, and do the factory setting. The bumper actually works really well. But It keeps popping up the same error message. Because it had passed the date for returning the product, I could not return it (this is how the customer service replied). Spend several hundred buying a broken product, not worth it.\n",
      "Title: Don‚Äôt waste your money!\n",
      "Body: Play Video\n",
      "It is called Linus, it stopped working after 6 months. Will not hold a charge. Put it in the closet then remembered it! Took it for repairs, it is toast. This home that Linus lived in is pet free and kid free except for the occasional Grandkids ü•∞. It did not have to work hard at all. Alas it‚Äôs a piece of crap and I will sadly be looking for a different brand.\n",
      "Title: Ordered new and received used\n",
      "Body: Vacuum arrived already used and dirty.\n",
      "Title: Terrible Experience\n",
      "Body: We have just purchased our first house and with 2 dogs we knew a robot vaccum would be a great fit with our very open floor plan and Hardwood surfaces throughout our home. We purchased this because We have heard of some great experiences, but unfortunately this was not the case for us:/ We had our robot vaccum running for about 3 weeks until one day I came home to what seemed for it to be bead in the middle of the room. After some checking and placing it back on its charger it kept giving and error number 6 (bumper Stuck) We tried EVERYTHING you can think of to troubleshoot before lastly removing the bumper which was pretty easy to make sure everything was in order and in fact it was perfectly normal. I called customer service who was useless after being on hold for over 30 minutes. They told me they would have been happy to help but because I removed 5 little screws from the bumper all they could do was give a 10% discount from a 600 dollar value (it‚Äôs literally half that on amazon lol). So basically we got to three weeks from a vaccum that was mid (barely cleaned against the floor and wall) couldn‚Äôt get any help, and tried to get ripped off. Im not one to write reviews but this was simply terrible. I am going a different route and hoping for a better experience. I‚Äôm sure other work great but would have love to have some support not even a month after purchase. I‚Äôd seriously consider looking at others even if they are a tad more for a better product and better service.\n",
      "Title: I give up\n",
      "Body: I have owned this for over a year now. Worked wonders for a month and then I've had nothing but trouble. It stops constantly, won't pick up debris and I have tried everything under the sun to get it to work. I have cleaned every part, I have installed new filters and brushes, but I give up. I wish I had bought a warranty because now I'm out the money on this. DONT BUY THIS.\n",
      "Title: Junk\n",
      "Body: One of the worst products I‚Äôve ever owned!\n",
      "Title: Don't buy used from Amazon services llc.\n",
      "Body: Bought this used. It appeared to be sold by Amazon and shipped by Amazon. Apparently Amazon.com Services, Inc was the seller. It looked like it was sold by Amazon Resale renamed from Amazon Warehouse.\n",
      "I recieved a robot that worked for less than one foot and could not go on. Why sell an obviously untested broken unit? It was packaged nicely and the collection bin looked good. The vacuum did not function. I was replacing a Shark Robot that I liked very much until it quit. Don't make my mistake and by used from Amazon. Amazon has changed for the worst. The refund system is slow and misleading. I am still waiting for them to refund my money to my account.\n",
      "Title: Doesn't Work!\n",
      "Body: Don't Buy this.... Hasn't worked after tons of calls and replacement parts.... Still nothing.\n",
      "Title: Broke after 6 months and the number to support won‚Äôt connect for help\n",
      "Body: I loved this product while it lasted. Some background we have all tile floors in our home. It easily navigated around furniture after it programmed a route around our home. It stopped charging a few months ago but I could get it to charge if I turned it on/off multiple times. If you take a chance and get this I would suggest a warranty since mine broke way before year was done. Also doesn‚Äôt seem like the product owner supports their product. I will be trying a different brand and won‚Äôt be repurchasing this one. Sad how things seem to be manufactured to fail.\n",
      "Title: It didn't clean\n",
      "Body: This is the 2nd Shark I bought in 1 month. Neither one of them picked up dog hair. Both only ran for about 20 minutes but report said they ran for an hour. I had to run them 2 or 3 times to pick up most of the hair. I even called Shark and they couldn't help.\n",
      "Needless to say the next one I buy will not be a shark.\n",
      "Title: 2 year update.\n",
      "Body: It's never worked well. The bristles fall off every single time we run it. The map has never worked and 75% of the time the robot gets stuck under our dining room table. It's labeled as an off limits area to avoid this. Wish I had saved up for a better one even though this one was over $400 when I bought it.\n",
      "Title: Disappointed!\n",
      "Body: Worked perfect for 3 months and now it will only vacuum a very tiny area. I have tried all of the reset tips and tricks and it just will not vacuum the entire house like it used to.\n",
      "Title: Stops working after 2mos?\n",
      "Body: App no longer working, product support put me on permahold. The problem is you can‚Äôt run this robot without the app. Amazon chat is AI no assistance there though it states 90 assistance? Not a good investment IMO.\n",
      "Title: Side Brush Motors\n",
      "Body: Didn‚Äôt even last a year and side brush motor is broke. Verified everything is clean too apart down to motor . Rotates just fine but still get the side brush error\n",
      "Title: Doesn't connect to wifi\n",
      "Body: After 9 months of use, the robot decided not to connect to the WiFi anymore‚Ä¶ useless now. Can‚Äôt even get in touch with the Shark support team‚Ä¶\n",
      "Title: Constantly clogged\n",
      "Body: Entry to in robot dust bin gets clogged with pet hair so it stops cleaning and nothing makes it into the dust bin. Replaced filter to try to resolve but same issue keeps happening. Pretty disappointing for a 500 dollar vacuum\n",
      "Title: Way too basic and terrible movement\n",
      "Body: This robot vacuum was worse than the Roomba i3 I previously owned. It was all over the place, very loud, and didn‚Äôt vacuum well.\n",
      "Title: Seller stinks\n",
      "Body: Bought it used like new and wouldn‚Äôt ya know it don‚Äôt work\n",
      "Title: Error 6\n",
      "Body: This product is less than 90 days old and now has an error 6 code that I cannot clear. I have removed the bumper as instructed...cleaned everything and reassembled. To no avail. Restored factory settings. Still giving error code 6. Our first Shark lasted like 4 years.....this one is a dismal failure....\n",
      "Title: No work .. he keeps turning around and does nothing\n",
      "Body: Play Video\n",
      "He doesn‚Äôt work.. he keeps going around ..see video attached\n",
      "Title: Stopped cleaning all the rooms and will not remap the house\n",
      "Body: Bougth the vacuum at the end of June. Unit worked great for two months. Then it stopped cleaning all the rooms on the map. Tried to remap the house and the unit will not do that now. Called customer support and then they tried to pass me to another agent who did not answer. That agent was supposed to call me back within the next 48 hours but it took 4 days. After several transfers finally got a technician that had to do a video call to watch my unit malfunctioning. My case was then passed to the software group. After waiting several more days they contacted me and had another video call to watch my unit malfunction. I was told I would need to send it back for replacement. This was now the middle of September. 10/13 I received an email that my order was cancelled and I would be refunded on 5-10 days. After 13 days I have no refund. Called again today and now have to wait 3-5 days for an email from a supervisor. Frustrating customer service and response.\n",
      "Title: Not even close to the Irobot\n",
      "Body: This is probably the worst money I have ever spent on Amazon. Horrible app, mediocre cleaning at best. Save your money and spend a little more to get the irobot\n",
      "Title: Works great WHEN it works\n",
      "Body: I bought two of these. When they came the 1st one didn't work. I had to call and get a replacement battery. Then three weeks later the vacuum upstairs stopped working. Apparently it needs a battery as well. These units are WAY TOO expensive for 100% failure on two units within 3 weeks of time. I would not recommend them. Like I said, they work great when they work, but they are not reliable\n",
      "Title: Short Lifespan\n",
      "Body: I purchased the Shark in April and have been trouble shooting issues for the past month or so. It is no longer working as it did when first purchased. It consistently stops cleaning for no reason. I have tried contacting to get additional support, but unable to get anywhere. Do not recommend this purchase.\n",
      "Title: Constantly complaining something wrong\n",
      "Body: If I added up all the time I have to rescue this whiny robot that something is wrong I could swept the house 50 times. The most high maintenance thing in my house. I‚Äôll try again in 10 years\n",
      "Title: So many issues\n",
      "Body: Broke so many times and finally died a forever death in under 2 years. Our first robot vacuum (not shark) lasted over 5 years. Not sure if we got a lemon but severely disappointed, especially for the price.\n",
      "Title: Awesome if you enjoy being frustrated\n",
      "Body: This thing worked amazing...for the first 6 months. The hardware works good, the vacuum portion does what it was designed to do. However, the software couldn't be worse. It constantly goes to the wrong area, or does 1/4 of the room you tell it to go to, then returns to its dock. It will even give you a report of the job it did, if I tell it to do the whole house, it's own report will show one or two single file passes through half of the rooms.\n",
      "And when you call tech support, they have you rotate the map 180 degrees on your phone. This get the vacuum to work decent enough for you to end your conversation with them. Then it immediately stops working again. I like every other aspect of this vacuum though, the self emptying dock and hardware are awesome. It just doesn't have any \"smart\" features that actually work.\n",
      "Title: PC of crap\n",
      "Body: Not happy\n",
      "Title: Don‚Äôt buy\n",
      "Body: If I could give this a 0 star I would.\n",
      "Title: This item sucks\n",
      "Body: It does not clean to the level thats required for pets as advertised. I am very disappointed in this product\n",
      "Title: Charging issues\n",
      "Body: Stopped charging after about year will not hold charge,\n",
      "Title: Doesn't work as advertised\n",
      "Body: Would love my money back. It doesn't work and I've only had it since June. Suction is horrible. Will not pick up dog hair. It keeps telling me brushes are stuck and roller needs assistance. Very disappointed üòû Do not purchase.\n",
      "Title: Don't Believe the \"Self Cleaning Brush Roll\" & Only Lasts 11 Months\n",
      "Body: Edit after 11 months: robot on a full charge but gave up mid clean and disconnected. No buttons working, not responsive. Too much money to spend on something that didn‚Äôt even last a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Works well in a two cat home to keep the floor from feeling dirty, but I bought this model because of the \"self cleaning brush roll\" that magically prevents hair wrapping. If you have medium length hair or more, it just wraps itself right around the middle of the brush roll and needs to be regularly cut away. Dissapointed.\n",
      "Title: Quits working\n",
      "Body: Worked for a few weeks flawlessly. Then it started having bumper issues. And now it won't work at all due to, \"make sure bumper moves freely\". I have watched all the youtube videos trying to fix it, and supposedly it's a warranty issue that shark has to fix. I had an older shark model that was just worn out so I thought I'd upgrade... I was wrong. This model does nothing different than the old model. I wish the issue would of shown up sooner before the warranty expired. Don't buy this one. Get an older model with less sensors\n",
      "Title: Brush motor failed\n",
      "Body: Brush motor failed in less than a year. I‚Äôve always cleaned hair and debris from not only under the side brushes but also the entire vacuum and replaced the filters every 3 months. This is my second shark robot vacuum in 3 years. Both vacuums failed due to side brush motors.\n",
      "Shark: I suggest a better side brush motor and an easier replacement process for the side brush motor. Guess it‚Äôs time to switch brands.\n",
      "Title: I DIES every few weeks\n",
      "Body: This product works great for a few weeks and then dies. I have had mine for six weeks. I am now on unit number three. The first two died within two weeks each one for different reasons. I call support and they replace it for me but with a one year warrantee I will be out of luck when it runs out. In short this product is not reliable.\n",
      "Title: DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE LIVING IN OVERSEAS\n",
      "Body: So one of the main reasons I bought this vacuum cleaner was because of the different functionalities it has and the ease of configurations. Well all of that is possible unless you are living abroad as it is my case as I'm currently assigned to a job postion in Central America.\n",
      "The problem, well you just cannot download the Shark Clean app, so you don't have access to all of the functionalities of the vacuum, and to be honest this wouldn't bother me if I would consider that the machine itself is having a great suction performance in it's standard operation mode, but apparently you need the app to configure this.\n",
      "\n",
      "So.... Just simply DO NOT PURCHASE WHILE LIVING OVERSEAS!\n",
