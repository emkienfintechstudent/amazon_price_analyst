What I like: -VERY easy to use. -easy to follow instructions -has a sticker on the bottom so if it ever stops and beeps, you can flip it over and it says exactly what the beeps mean (one beep means one thing, two beeps means another--which is SUPER helpful!). -color on top clearly shows what mode it is in (blue-ready to go, orange-needs to charge, red-problem to fix-such as emptying the tray). -very quiet. I can work on stuff with it in the room and it does not bother me at all (my dog also does not mind it). -works great on white carpet and easily transitions from my living room to dining room (which has a slight bump). -when its low on battery, it does not die where it is at, it just turns off the vacuum then finds the home doc and charges itself. -just works really well. I run it everyday and I am impressed by how much stuff it gets (especially when it goes under things such as the couch). -if it gets caught on a cord, it usually takes 5-10 seconds but then it stops the suctioning and moves away (releasing the cord or other item). However if you have a small cord you should put it up (and you should regardless, I just noticed it doing this a few times and thought it was neat, but I do try to pick up all cords).  What could be improved: -nothing really in particular to this. -It does not work well on anything black, but this is true for all robot vacuums. It sometimes gets stuck when it goes on the black carpet we have with the black chairs (I suspect because it can not detect them), but this has not happened often. My dog has a black mat for her food and water and it always bumps into it and spills the water, but again, this would occur with any robot vacuum. -Also, make sure the doc is against a wall because otherwise it will move and never charge (self explanatory, but I did not do the first time and it kept trying to doc and was just pushing the doc around the floor). -Finally, you do have to dump out the vacuum particles almost every time you run it (if you do a full circle/battery cycle). It is really easy to dump and beeps when it needs to be emptied. Again, nothing really negative, just something to note.  Overall, I really like this! It does a nice job cleaning up the dog hair and other things that get on my floor and saves me a lot of time not vacuuming daily. If you have a dog, I would watch them with this first before you use it. My dog was initially scared of it but sniffed it\\'s \"butt\" and now they are cool and she does not mind it at all. Pleased with this product and would recommend! :)  **UPDATE** On another note, Eufy has amazing customer service! I received an email from them addressing each of my \"what could be improved\" components with more information on the product. Very impressed.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 5313, 'reviewer': {'name': 'CF'}}, {'title': 'Works for Me!  Floors noticeably cleaner, cat hair gone...', 'body': 'I have been surprised by the price/performance of the Eufy 11s Max. I was never willing to pony up hundreds of dollars or (gasp!) $1,000+ for a robot vacuum. The $139 Eufy has made my entry into the world of robotic cleaning a good experience. In the past, I have relied on Rubbermaid\\'s (Commercial) Microfibre 18\" mop and Bona hardwood cleaner. I still do for spills and mopping my upstairs hardwoods and vinyl planks on the ground floor.  This modest Eufy 11s Max does a great job of picking up the cat hairs from 4 furry friends, tracked cat litter, dust and all the rest of the debris that magically accumulates on 3k sq. ft. of flooring. Its cleaning power improves and eases the way for any subsequent wet mop scenario.  - Excellent along baseboards and thresholds, hardwoods, vinyl planking, under sofas - Quiet - Automatically increases suction power on carpets (iQ) - The remote control allows me to easily direct the 11s Max to different rooms I want to clean - Very good at avoiding falling down stairs - Renewable parts on this unit are easily available and reasonably priced - Ricochets around like a drunk...but knows its way \"home!\" - Source of endless fascination for the cats  -Not so good on Persian, Afghan or Caucasian carpets with fringe. (I fold them up or, in some cases, tuck the fringe under the carpet ends. I prefer to use a good vacuum with less brush action on fine carpets.) But the Eufy does a nice job on the underside of carpets, especially along the edges where dust, hair and debris seem to gather. Again, this is where the \"manual\" dimension of the remote control proves to be an actual advantage.  I\\'m learning to clean, then shift boxes and other obstacles out of the way to allow other areas to get a better cleaning in alternate \"Auto\" sessions.  My eyes and my bare feet tell me the Eufy 11s Max is doing a good cleaning job. The amount of cat hair in the disposal tray seconds that conclusion.  It may not be the smartest, most powerful or \"very best\" robo vacuum you can buy but its great performance and $139 price tag speak to me.  Unfortunately, it hasn\\'t been able to explain why cats prefer hurling hairballs on my carpets instead of the hard flooring.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 76, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Amazon Customer'}}, {'title': 'Cleans well but very noisy', 'body': 'My previous Shark IQ self empty was having issues so it was time for a replacement. With some research it was clear that the Eufy was considered one of the better self emptying robots especially at the price point. This robot does not work with magnetic strips as my previous robot did and has a very high-pitch sound when it runs. The noise is pretty obnoxious despite the level of suction you have it set to and my fiancé requests that i don’t run it when we’re home. The app is easy to use, gives realtime map tracking, connects easily, it seems to adapt well to furniture and layout changes, and it gives you 120 minutes of battery life per clean. I also appreciate that it doesn’t run into walls, furniture, cabinets, etc. Our biggest complaint is how loud it is compared to our previous robot but it handles dog hair well and clearly does a good job so we’re just putting up with it lol', 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': 18, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Corinne'}}, {'title': 'Great value! Eufy is hardworking!', 'body': \"I just renovated a 1960s rancher, and had to move in while reno was still ongoing. Needless to say, there was and is lots of dust. To add to the mix, I have three cats whose favorite hobby is shedding. A 60 year old, self-avowed cat lady, I could not keep up with the dust and hair. I had a Shark robo vac which I used on a carpeted floor. It did not do a great job, and I was constantly getting messages that Lurch's sidewheel was stuck, usually under a king sized bed. I would have to rake it out from under with a golf club. The Shark also left cat hair in the carpet. I took the Shark, along with my three cats, to my Florida condo where there was no carpet. The Shark still got stuck, could never find its dock, and just didn't do a great job cleaning.  This Eufy beats that Shark like a drum! I have no carpet in this house, but do have a couple of washable rugs. Eufy does a great job on the LVP, hardwoods, and rugs alike. The only time it has gotten stuck was when it sucked up an electrical cord. Its bumper is more sensitive than the Shark's, so Eufy doesn't push lightweight items around.  Eufy was easy to set up, and did a good 30 minute run right out of the box. There's a remote control with it, and a nifty tool for cleaning the brush. The instruction book is a bit vague on what all you can get it to do, and the icons in the book didn't match up with the ones on the remote, but I haven't used the remote for it yet, as it runs perfectly by just pushing the go button on Eufy's back.  It sucks up and collects all the cat hair it can find, and is still getting its share of construction gerbis. I thought I would never be able to walk barefoot in this house, but Eufy has changed that!  Eufy finds its dock when the charge gets low. Its low profile enables it to get under sofas and chairs.  The collection tank is easy to empty and clean. The brush is easy to remove, and the tool makes for easy and quick cleaning of it.  Eufy is reasonably quiet.  My only complaint is that Eufy doesn't sense stairs and drop offs like my old Shark. The first time I turned Eufy on, it raced straight for the sun room doors, and over the edge-a good 6 inch drop-and landed on its back like a dying bug. The construction is strong enough to withstand the drop, but I block off that opening when Eufy is now on the job.  Eufy's full charge gives a long run time that will clean a good 1000 feet of space.  Overall, Eufy is a powerful little vac, and well worth the price. There's no app, like with the Shark, but you can set it to run with the remote.  If you have hard floors and pets, don't hesitate to get this thing!  Caveat: I cannot attest to how much cat weight Eufy will support, as I cannot get mine to ride it.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 54, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Avid Reader'}}, {'title': 'Not durable, makes loud noises after a short time', 'body': 'At first, I loved this little thing, and like many named it (Gary). It was impressive how every day it had a tray with a bunch of dust and dog hair in it. In my experience with vacuums and electronics, your product will last much longer if you take good care of it. Before going to bed, I \"Gary proof\" the house, picking up any random charging cables, socks, etc, and putting the dogs up so they don\\'t have an accident streaked all over the house. I run it early morning at 2am. I empty the tray every morning, which takes less than a minute. Every week or so, usually monday morning, I spend less than 5 minutes to take the side brushes and roller off, and remove any hair/strings. This is probably much more frequently than you HAVE to do it, but with my experience in maintenance, I prefer to do it more often and regularly.  He\\'s a dumb vacuum, and occasionally gets stuck in weird places, or will grab a low hanging wire and get caught up, but it\\'s a good thing he\\'s dumb. We don\\'t have true AI, so spending a ton on special sensors and algorithms to pretend that a smarter vacuum has been created, is just a waste of money. When looking at reviews for all the major robovac brands, they all get stuck occasionally and have issues. I don\\'t care that Gary sometimes gets stuck, because it doesn\\'t happen too frequently. A dumb robovac that runs regularly and has a decent battery life will make for a much cleaner home, and with much less effort, than vacuuming on my own. Will it sometimes miss a spot? Sure, but it eventually gets to it. Are there spots it can\\'t get to? Yes, but those are spots that I\\'d have to get the hose and attachments out for anyways. Up to this point, I\\'d give this vacuum 5 stars. It\\'s effective, and at a much more reasonable price than the competition. It does everything I need, and doesn\\'t have a lot of extra crap thrown in there. So, why 3 stars then?  It\\'s not durable. There is something wrong in the design of the roller brush, or the containment of the roller brush, and it starts making a loud vibrating noise after a few months. I purchased it in May of 2018, and by August it was ridiculously loud. After a bunch of minor tests, that were already answered and then ignored in my initial email, and video I provided of how loud it was, they agreed it was faulty. Anker/Eufy sent me a replacement, after I sent mine back. They let me keep the extra accessories, such as the spare side brushes, the hair removal tool, and even the charging dock, and sent me what appeared to be a brand new robovac, packaging and accessories just like it ships from Amazon. It\\'s now February, and the robovac is making the same loud noise again. I\\'ve done some extra troubleshooting on my own, and narrowed it down to the brush, or brush holder. As it\\'s spinning, it\\'s vibrating. All of the contact points are plastic. If I take the brush out, it stops vibrating. I put some thin foam tape between the enclosure of the brush and the plastic casing that holds it in, to see if the brush was causing it to vibrate. That didn\\'t stop the sound. It\\'s like the brush is bouncing around in it\\'s housing. It looks like the spinning brush wears away at the casing that holds it in place. I don\\'t see a way to repair it on my own, or to prevent it from happening again. We\\'ll see how Anker handles the issue the second time. I\\'m not looking forward to dealing with it again, and I\\'m hesitant to recommend this to anyone else.  It\\'s important to note that I work from home, so running it during the day isn\\'t conducive to me working. When it\\'s working properly, it\\'s quiet enough to run at night and not be a bother. It will randomly bump into a door sometimes, so if you\\'re a light sleeper, it may be a problem, but for our family it\\'s not an issue. It\\'s only after it degrades and start making loud noises that it\\'s an issue. If you have an empty house during the day, and it wouldn\\'t matter if it\\'s extra loud when it runs, then it would work perfectly fine.  Edit:3/11/19 After some confusing back and forth with Eufy Support, they\\'ve replaced my 11S with a 30C and even through in some boundary strips. Initially they just wanted to replace it completely, but I was concerned that it would just break again, this time out of warranty. They offered to upgrade to the 30. After I sent it, another support rep reached out saying they should have troubleshot the robovac more, and not to send it in as they had some other tests to do and if that didn\\'t fix it, they could fix the roller. I let them know I already sent it. I asked if they could send me a 30C so I\\'d get wifi as well, and I\\'d pay the difference. They said they couldn\\'t ship the 30C because Amazon owned it. While waiting for my robovac to get to them, the 35C came out, and it\\'s listed for sale from their website. I asked if that could be sent instead, and again I\\'d pay the difference. They said they couldn\\'t, but they\\'d ship an extra boundary set for the confusion earlier. I thought they said they\\'d send the 30C, not the 30, so responded that would be good. They cleared it up saying they could send the 30 with an extra boundary strip or the 30C without it. I chose 30C without. They decided to send the 30C and the extra boundary strip! Way over the top support, trying to make me happy. I wasn\\'t upset, or being a jerk about it, they were just extremely accommodating. Based on the great customer support (minus minor confusions, some on my part) I\\'m bumping it up to a 5 star. They really stand behind their products. I also think any future issues that may pop up can be alleviated with troubleshooting the roller brush, which should be replaced occasionally anyways.', 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 33, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Eric Jones'}}, {'title': 'Surpassed My Expectations!', 'body': 'I recently purchased the Eufy L60 vacuum robot cleaner, and I must say, it has truly exceeded my expectations!

After a couple friends raved about their robovac\\'s, I made excuses like \"My home layout is too complex!\" and \"I\\'ll need three of them to vacuum my home!\" But, the robot wars have made them cheaper and better, so I decided to finally give in on a good deal with this new model from a well trusted brand. I wasn\\'t willing to pay for units with home mapping features and no-go zones, but with this unit, I don\\'t feel I even need it. Turns out, I am absolutely thrilled with the performance and price point of these Eufy\\'s.  There is little doubt this unit is just slightly smarter than a bag of hammers. Thank goodness I can make it do it\\'s work at 4AM when I don\\'t care how many times it goes over the same spot or misses something that is just \"right over there you stupid bleeping robot!\" But, day after day, this hunk of electronic sensors strapped to a vacuum comes home with a bin full of stuff. I\\'m at the point where I don\\'t even know where it gets the stuff and I\\'m seriously questioning my ability to clean my house. And also somewhat ashamed of the filth that I\\'ve lived with and didn\\'t even know about.  It goes places it probably shouldn\\'t and if you have any degree of OCD, it will hurt your brain to watch it. It goes under furniture and shelving where it barely manages to escape, plays ping pong with table/chair legs for a bit and it has an inexplicable infatuation with the clear storage totes under my guest bed. It\\'ll really like one area/room for awhile, but then will go elsewhere, only to be back 2 minutes later...and you\\'re like, \"Well, that was the *least* efficient way to do that. Whatever, a goldfish is smarter than you.\" Whenever I\\'m in the kitchen doing something, it has the whole lower floor it could be cleaning, but it will insist several times on cleaning the spot right under my feet. It loves to chase my cats and in turn, my cats will engage it in a battle of home domination, swatting it and trying to eat the spinny brushes while it charges. One cat will lay on the lower step and lazily swat at it as it goes by. Just when you think there might be the slightest sense of intelligence and you\\'re having this \"It\\'s alive!\" moment, it reminds you how dumb it is by gently ramming itself into a piece of furniture. I don\\'t know how it does it, but despite looking like it couldn\\'t find it\\'s way out of a paper bag, it somehow manages to find home base for charging most of the time.  But, it gets around, even in an ever changing layout. It deals with my wood floors, several area rugs and a section of medium pile carpet without much incident. It hasn\\'t once tried to go over a stair in my home. It gets probably a good 70%+ of a complex, 1,000 square foot U-shaped layout of my main floor, with plenty of furniture making navigation much worse. But, it does that 70%+ every day and I don\\'t even have to think about it. Based on the sheer amount of cat hair and dust this thing picks up daily, I\\'d say the suction and pickup mechanisms are pretty good. I can\\'t tell you if they\\'re better than older Eufy or other branded units, but the spec\\'s say so.  I was worried about how much of my lifestyle I\\'d have to change to adapt to this thing. Turns out, very little. I can still leave stuff around if I want and it won\\'t try to eat everything in its path. It does occasionally try to commit robot death on various cat toys the kitties leave about, but that\\'s maybe one 1 out of 10 times it needs saving. I have a rug in my kitchen that it loves to push into a pile, but that\\'s only a minor annoyance and doesn\\'t cause it harm. I have to be careful not to leaving charging cords and such about. Once every couple weeks it won\\'t find it\\'s way all the way home, but it\\'s usually pretty darn close to the charging station by the time it dies. I thought it might become inconvenient to \"save\" the unit from it\\'s self-inflicted stupidity, but the value it provides exceeds the inconvenience.  I can see why people like these things. And there\\'s a good chance I may buy the three I need, maybe this one or maybe others. But, for now I\\'m pretty happy with this one. It\\'s a 5 out of 5 cat toy and a pretty useful home appliance that will save you time and improve your home\\'s upkeep. I\\'ll update this review with any significant changing opinions, but for now this \"dumb, smart thing\" gets 5 stars.  Update: About 4 months after running this thing daily, one of the side brush motors started to malfunction. Normally, a product malfunctioning that soon would irk me to reducing my review stars immediately, but I sucked it up and contacted support. I requested, specifically, to do a self repair of the brush motor right out of the gate. They didn\\'t request for me to send it in for repair, demand an expensive cross shipped replacement or question my self-assessment to repair equipment that I owned. They just told me they have the part in stock, requested I send them a video of the problem, asked for the address and put the brush motor in the mail. They then confirmed that if this didn\\'t make it work right, they would still support me until it did. They worked with me exactly how I wanted them to, stood behind their product 100% and for that, not even a single star will be reduced from my original review.  Update 2: I knocked two stars from my review. Not because of the unit, which is still great, but because of the replacement air filters. They are $11 for TWO of them! That\\'s nearly 3 times the price of the previous filters, or about a $65 annual operating cost when changing them out once a month. IMO, that\\'s simply too expensive for a vacuum and even my high end upright isn\\'t nearly that expensive to operate using *HEPA grade* vacuum bags. Not just that, they are incredibly terrible for the environment by requiring you to buy the substantial plastic filter housing every time. Had I known this at the time of my purchase, I would have selected a different unit - probably the initial version of the 11S.  Final Update: I\\'ve decided to just let this thing die a slow and painful death. Both of my side brush motors went out, as did the one that I replaced. It\\'s still marginally effective without them, but definitely not as good as having them. Eufy\\'s support reached out to me several times, which was great, but I have better things to do than rip this thing apart every few months to fix plastic parts that will fail again in 3 months. I expect more from something I\\'m paying $200+ for, definitely not three of the same exact failures within a year. Oh, and there\\'s much cheaper 3rd party filters available for this guy now.', 'rating': 3, 'helpfulVotes': 1802, 'reviewer': {'name': 'J.

There is no good reason for an appliance to connect to the internet. It cleans well. Has cut way down on the daily sweeping chore. I really like that it goes under the furniture (most of my furniture). Easy to empty and I do so when it occurs to me and is convenient to do so. It has yet to \"ask me\" to be emptied. I probably do it once a week or so when doing other chores. Quietest vacuum I\\'ve ever had (though also the smallest). Con: Doesn\\'t get all the way into the corners, so one has to weep the corners out once in a while. Can get stuck under some furniture (in my case where I have a tapered toe kick board under a book case that it can sometimes wedge itself into). Has problems with electric cords and strings.

As it moves randomly, it can take some time to vacuum a space thoroughly.', 'rating': 4, 'helpfulVotes': 3, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Saturnine'}}, {'title': 'Well worth the money for saving time, energy, and effort', 'body': \"This (really long) review is for the Eufy 11S Max robot vacuum (Robovac). Please note “Max” vs regular 11S. They may look the same; but the Max uses a different filter and has the higher 2000pa suction. Otherwise the functions and options (other than suction choices) are the same. I've used the 11S Max for the last month on my low pile carpet (about 80% of the roaming area) with the rest being tile or linoleum flooring. It has been quite fascinating to watch so I've actually put about 85-90 charge cycles on the unit over the last month (yes, three times a day on most days and it's still finding more dirt/dust than I would expect).  Right up front, I'd definitely buy another when it comes time to replace this one. After comparing how I vacuum my flooring, especially to pick up my biggest carpet enemy; short stray bits of dried grass stems, the “random” wandering of this vacuum model made more sense to me than the other fancier choices. Most vacs do a good job with dust, dirt, sand, cheerios, etc. but these stem pieces are only picked up by a vacuum when it comes at the stem with the brush roller pretty much parallel to the stem. That means random directions will more likely get these pesky problems than an organized back & forth cleaning approach. Granted it may take a few cleaning cycles or several passes over the same area during one cycle; but since the Robovac has completed its first 5-6 cycles I rarely find them anymore or if I do spot one it's not for very long.  Robovac is a big time saver as well as an energy saver for me. I would use my canister vacuum about an hour each week for routine cleaning and once a month for 2+ hours to do a more thorough cleaning. A watt-hour meter indicated that my canister vacuum used 5-6 kw-hr of electricity each month. Robovac uses about 12 watts continuously for about 4 hours when charging (surprisingly less than the 5-6 hrs listed in the manual; but it is brand new). Once the battery is charged, the power consumption drops to about ½ watt. When Robovac is away cleaning, the charging base uses just ¼ watt for the homing beacon. So if used just once a day; Robovac would only use about 60 watts per day. That means once-a-day cleaning would only use 1.8 Kw-hr energy per month. By letting Robovac take over the regular weekly cleaning with once a day operation (or less), I'm able to cut my electric bill by an easy 3-4 kw-hr/month.  With that said, there are a few things that I think need improved:  First, there should be an interlock on the dust bin – Robovac will merrily go off about it's scheduled cleaning cycle without the bin installed! So if removed for emptying; don't forget to re-install the bin before the next scheduled operation. Plus, I noticed on a couple occasions, that I wasn't paying attention and I left one corner was about 1/8” out from fully inserted. Not sure if that will cause suction leaks; but you need to make sure the bin is completely inserted.  Second, you can't select “max” (or any power level) when using the remote to manually clean an area. It appears to only operate on “standard” suction with manual operation (i.e., when Robovac is not running a regular cleaning mode and you chose to override it's direction). In addition, if you select the remotes' edge or spot cleaning modes it will automatically go to “max” power for the duration of that mode and you can't choose IQBoost or standard power level on those selections.  Third, I don't know why the 20 minutes for edge cleaning or 30 minutes for quick cleaning was selected. Robovac can make it about 60-70% around my home in the 20 minutes of edge cleaning. If edge cleaning mode was permitted to run until it made a trip all way around and back to the charging station where it could dock to finish that mode would work better. An alternate solution would be if I could set the cycle time for edge cleaning and quick cleaning modes. Plus I'd like having an option for it to simply stop when the time is up rather than automatically returning to the base. When I want just one room cleaned; I'll set Robovac to auto or quick mode in that room, then close the door or put down a barrier, and return later to stop it manually and take it back to the charging base. If I don't return in a timely manner Robovac will be trying to locate the charging base and running the battery down.  Fourth, Robovac cleans edges using only its right side pretty much all of the time. It would be helpful to have it randomly choose using either the right or left side whenever edge cleaning. I watched it edge clean a carpet/wall area three times going only in a counterclockwise direction (right side) and it still didn't pick up all the dust bunnies. I used manual control with it hugging the wall on its left side and it picked them up with no problem. Also, be aware that manual operation, when Robovac is not already working in a selected cleaning mode (overriding current movement), only works while the remote buttons are pressed. Robovac stops all functions shortly after a button is released when used manually.  Fifth, I really don't need to run Robovac on a daily schedule – there should be a weekly scheduling capability even for the least expensive robot vacuums. It shouldn't be that difficult or expensive to update this model to correct this issue. Even if it's the same set cleaning time, every day for the selected days; just give me the ability to schedule cleaning cycles one to seven times a week.  Sixth, when the battery runs low, Robovac can take forever, if it makes it back at all, to the charging base. I will routinely go looking for it if I haven't seen it return within 10-15 minutes after the approximate cleaning time has passed. The age-old solution for solving a maze (your home from Robovacs' perspective) is to constantly follow along obstacles using just one side (Robovac does recognize when it's circling something like a coffee table and adjusts accordingly after a 360 degree rotation). This method is how Robovac tries getting closer to the charging station when it's more than about 15ft away and not in line-of-sight (the charging base emits an infrared signal for homing action – make sure you keep Robovacs' bumper and the base clean). Sometimes Robovac occasionally gets diverted or the software tells it to try something different) and it will go off in another (often wrong) direction (extremely frustrating!). I highly recommend observing Robovac perform it's return operation from various areas in your home. I ended up placing a 2x4 along the end legs of my sofa as Robovac was consistently going along the side skirt, under the skirt at front of the sofa, then around the front leg exiting the side of the skirt, and then heading straight across the room. It would then go thru three other rooms and come back to the sofa again. The 2x4 forced Robovac to continue edging under the sofa, along the back wall, and out the other end which has an end table that mimics the 2x4 at the opposite end. Before using the 2x4, Robovac took well over an hour to get back to the charging base (it eventually changes up it's routine, usually after three tries) and required 5 hrs to recharge. With the 2x4, Robovac has been able to get back from the far end of my house to the charging base in under 20 minutes very consistently. While the ability to improve Robovacs' return mode is really limited to what you can do, the key point I'm making here is that the battery will always give you more charge cycles (longer life) before needing replacement if you can get Robovac back to the charging base as soon possible.  Seventh, pay attention to the thin rubber wiping strip on the brush guard. After 60+ cycles I noticed the ends of the thin rubber strip (about 1/16” of it's height) were tearing away. I believe this was most likely due to moving back and forth over edging from tile/linoleum to carpet or maybe due to the floor mounted furnace registers in my home. I simply trimmed the torn bits off to keep them from getting caught by the brush. After about 100 cycles I noted the rest of the 1/16” strip was now gone. This impacts the tile/linoleum cleaning far more than carpet; but it is something to watch for. I highly recommend checking the rubber strip during brush cleaning and purchasing a brush guard replacement as part of a maintenance set. Hopefully the manufacturer will improve the thickness or type of material used to prevent or at least reduce this problem occurring in the future.  Next, a few helpful hints I've learned or didn't find in the owner's manual:  The “bowl” shape on top of the charging base with the white LED is just right to hold the remote control, button-side up. However, I prefer to turn remote controls' button-side down to keep them cleaner so it's up to you if you use it or not.  I've had a few occasions when Robovac actually bumped into the charging base so it was no longer sitting square against the wall. This will impact it's ability to find the base when the battery is low. I took a used rectangular-shaped one quart motor oil bottle from my recycling bin, cleaned it thoroughly, and filled it with sand. It's now a 3-4lb weight sitting on top of the charging base. I haven't had the base re-positioned since adding the weight. Normally Robovac does a good job avoiding the charging base; but not always.  Robovac “parks” about 1/2” away from the charging base tower. If you are careful, you can swipe a cloth over the bumper sensors to clean off any surface dust that has collected (always seems to be some); however, be careful as Robovac might activate while you are doing this. You might also get a solid red indicator without any beeps. This error isn't described in the manual; but I've found if I just lift Robovac off the charging base for few seconds and then replace it, it will change back to the charging orange color. (I suspect the solid red indicates a sensor error) It's also quite easy to remove/replace the dust bin during charging. Unfortunately you will need to flip Robovac on it's back to remove/clean the side and roller brushes as well as the bottom IR sensors and charging contacts, so remember to turn Robovac off with the topside button before doing this or get used to it trying to start up while you are cleaning it. Also make sure the blue/orange indicator light is on when you reposition it on the base. Sometimes Robovac will remain off rather than return to charging mode.  After two or three cleaning cycles I'll do a regular check on the all the brushes and swap left and right side brushes when they are re-installed; seems to straighten and make them work a little better, maybe last longer too.  Oddly the remote control spot clean button symbol and the manual indicate a clockwise spiral for the cleaning operation; but when I've selected it, Robovac has always used a counterclockwise rotation.  If the side brushes happen to “hang up” on something, Robovac will stop spinning them while it maneuvers around the obstacle and then restart the brushes when it thinks it is clear. Don't assume there's a problem when you see this unless Robovac beeps and the indicator turns red.  The flat handle end of a spoon or fork works great for prying the filter free from the bin for cleaning. Every time I have tried using my fingers; it pops out tossing dust/lint everywhere.  The IQBoost mode doesn't seem to change going from hard flooring to low pile carpet or vice versa in my home. I think this is because the low pile carpet just doesn't cause enough “drag” for it to recognize that it could adjust the suction level. (I'm still not clear as to whether there's just two suction levels or if Robovac can vary linearly between the two) While the manual indicates a 40 min run time in “max” mode with medium nap carpet, I'm obtaining about 60 minutes with my low nap carpet. I do find the “max” mode clearly picks up more dust. I ran Robovac 20+ times on IQ mode before switching to “max” for its scheduled operation. The filter has clearly shown a thicker layer of accumulation on the filter.  When “max” mode is set as default you will occasionally hear the vacuum whining noise change briefly. Best I can figure is it's a software glitch where the IQBoost code tries to adjust the suction level; but then resets it to max. I normally hear this shortly after Robovac goes from one flooring type to another. It also occurs shortly after it starts it's routine.  Robovac does not communicate back to the remote. So if for instance, you press edge cleaning and Robovac doesn't get the message, the remote will show it should be performing edge cleaning even though it's not. Similar situation when Robovac is recharging or is returning to recharge; the remote will still show it's in the selected cleaning mode rather than the “charging” icon. You simply have to pay attention that Robovac has recognized your command by a “beep”.  I found using the basketball nozzle with my Ryobi P737 inflator does an excellent job cleaning the filter. It takes only a couple minutes to clean both the filter and the bin (outdoors of course!). The original filter has been cleaned well over 100 times now and other than being a little dingy it's still working great. This should help stretch the recommended replacement interval to more than 2 months compared to the recommended “tapping it” to clean. Do not use the “canned” compressed air as I frequently find it wets surfaces during extended spraying and the Robovac filter is a paper element.  If you have a sofa, chair, etc, with stiff or heavy cloth skirting down to the floor; I suggest safety pinning up at least a foot or two of the skirting on an open side. When or if Robovac switches to using the proximity mode for cleaning AFTER it gets under the furniture, the skirt will appear like a wall and it will keep running around underneath the furniture until it switches to a collision mode where the weight of the skirt generally will not trip the bumper sensors and stop it from escaping.  I'm glad I've used Robovac during the daytime so I could track it down and figure out what trouble it got into during its normal operation or when I expected it to be back at the charging base. The alarm beep sounds can easily be missed when it's far away from you. Plus, when it powers down after getting stuck can make it lot more challenging to find! It's a lot easier to locate when the vacuum sound is still going or even if it's just the quieter wheel motors running it around looking for the charging base.  To wrap up my review. I've found Robovac to be a well built, nicely designed, and quite durable robot vacuum. The $160 price I paid is quite reasonable with excellent cleaning ability (given it has about 1/10 the suction of a typical canister vac). It has good battery run times (my mixed flooring on IQ mode lets Robovac run about 80-85 minutes before recharging), and it is a wonderful time and energy saver. If you've been thinking about a robot vacuum without all the extras (or just don't like vacuuming), the Eufy 11S Max is a great choice.\", 'rating': 5, 'helpfulVotes': 438, 'reviewer': {'name': 'Andrew Bean'}}, {'title': 'Over a year in use... study this review for real analysis', 'body': 'Summary: I read a LOT of reviews about a LOT of products of a similar nature before I leapt in to buy this, my first robot. Overall, this product was good SOLID value for the money.  I have now owned it for for OVER a year now, used daily and this analysis is based on close observations during that period. NOT one of those folks who buy it an write a review five minutes after they pull something out of the box. Here are the key points you should consider when buying a Robot to sweep your floors.  1. Price - Look...Price was definitely a consideration at buy in. I studied many models before I bought this one. These kinds of robots overall cost money. $$$. Of course, I am old school. These days some folks buy a Cell phone that cost $500 dollars to $1000 and think nothing of it. To me that is WAY too much. Ditto many models of similar robots. At the time I bought it the robot was on sale so I got a price that was $100 cheaper than competitors whose reviews read about the same as this one did. So the buy in pricewise was a good solid deal that was in what I consider the medium to upper low cost affordability range. Perhaps you would think nothing of spending $850 on a robot. Not me. Like goldilocks, this one was just right. SECRET Costs you may not think about: Some reviews address this, but consider these things as being costs IN ADDITION to buy in: Filters: This thing has a filter. I recall one review whining that filters cost too much. Let me be clear. If you want a new HEPA filter for it every week or two, they will cost you. Me? The filter does not seem to me to very critical since I do not really plan on the robot cleaning my air. It gets dirty and dusty. As a result, I pull it every other use and wash it out under a faucet in my kitchen (a two minute job), let it dry a bit and then put it right back in the machine (Which is super easy to do...no tools or anything - just pull out - click in.) After reading one alarmist review prior to buying, I bought one spare filter at the same time I bought the robot thinking I might find it was true. So far, after a year or more of use, I STILL have not replaced the filter. Just keep using the original. Think about it. Brushes - I bought a kit with spare brushes when I bought the robot. Glad I did. Buy at least one set just to you have them around when you need them. The brushes twirl around and shove cat hair into the maw of the thing as it races around. Somewhere. Somehow, as it toodled about around the six month mark, it threw a brush. (They snap on and off easily) Like a horse throwing a shoe, this is to be expected. This thing runs all over on its own so I could not find where it lost it. To this day I STILL have not found the missing brush. No problem. I just grabbed a spare, snapped it on and it kept on going. Tools - The kit I bought early came with a little cleaning/maintenance tool. See my section on Maintenance below about tools.  2. Utility - Utility to me means ease of use. Based on a year of hard use for my robot you should consider the following lessons learned about utility: CLEANING FLOORS a. Does is really sweep ALL the floor? Read a lot of reviews and looked at a variety of designs. Some reviews that I recall said \"This thing finds a LOT of dirt. Where does it get it all?\" After a year of emptying it (You DO need to empty its evening sweep into your trash, usually every day - VERY easy to do - again click out- click in) I totally agree! This thing finds a TON of dirt and dust that is NOT obvious to the naked eye. Frankly, that is its job and I need to make clear here that it does its job really really well. VERY SATISFIED b. To be utter clear however... I have a three story house. To define that though that is two stories with WOODEN and some tile Floors and a third floor that is mixed wood, carpet and concrete. PRO: I cheat. One robot for three floors of my house! Every day or two I pick it up from its charger, move it from floor to floor to let it clean a different floor whenever the mood strikes me. Works great! More, this thing cleans almost all of those floors flawlessly - especially the wood, tile and concrete bits. It sneaks into lots and lots of corners, under furniture and stuff and it never, ever runs off the edge of stairs. Completely satisfied. I admit I may be so satisfied because wood, tile and concrete are 92% of my floors and it is flawless on those types of floors. CON: This is a real review, not a feel good propaganda babble. If there is a con to this robot it is carpets. Specifically, it WILL work across modern carpet. That is carpet that is tight, laid level with the rest of the floor and has nothing to hang it up on. However, it struggles to go over edges, so if there is an edge to your carpet, a strip that it has to ride up over OR (Like me) you have a carpet or two that are Persian Style rugs with tassels at the end, just be advised that it WILL choke as it tries to cross these barriers. You can still do these surfaces, but you will have to stay nearby and bail it out when/if it hangs up... which feels time wasting. This should not make you hesitate to buy based on this review UNLESS you have a lot of these carpet barrier things about your house, in which case you will be annoyed by this robot. To be fair however, you may be annoyed by ANY robot under those conditions. Just think about it before you buy. ******** Utility NOTE! This is a final note on utility. The REAL Nemesis of any robot is WIRES/Cords. Once you own one, you will figure this out pretty quick. You will need to get your cords under control since the robots will find power cords on computers, lamps etcetera and choke up on them. 80% of the time when it does not return to its charger at after you program it to clean (Smart folks program that between 1AM and 3AM - unless you tell it to go manually for some reason) you will have to track it down to find it hung up on wires. Once again, to be fair, I think this is true of virtually all robots. They are not too bright about wires. The other 20% of hang-ups comes from some oddity in your furniture. I have particular chair in my study whose side supports are JUST a bit too short for the robot to go under, so it drive in there and wedges itself into the spot and cannot get free on its own. Just to you know, this is fair enough, robot makers cannot anticipate every single possible piece of odd furniture. Just figure it out through trial and error, but enjoy all the cleaning it does WITHOUT you paying the slightest attention. A small price to pay. *********Utility NOTE 2: The control - Comes with a remote. To be frank, I only use two or three features on the control. I tested them all at the beginning, but I\\'ve forgotten what the rest do. Most used? Manual use button. Because of how I use it on other floors, the automatic run feature is only good on one floor. Works flawlessly as far as I can see. I tote it to the second floor, put it down, hit the manual timed button and off it goes. I wander back up an hour two later, hit the off button and walk it back to its charger. Second most used? The recharge button - This tells it got back to recharge station manually. If you you do not want it to keep going you can interrupt its cycle and it will go back to its recharging. Usually use this when I am watching a show, it starts on its own and I find the noise distracts me from watching. Third most used feature? The manual steering controls. One review I read said this machine is really stupid. That is half true. It does fine most of the time, but if you want to steer it manually on occasion you can. I have a table I want to make sure it does under in a certain way, so I just point and click it to drive it into the bits when I want them to be cleaned.  3. Maintenance - Look. Old soldiers will tell you. Preventative maintenance will allow you to keep using your equipment day in and day out. This robot IS reliable IF you know you will need to maintain it! If you are lazy you will hate doing maintenance. I just make it part of day\\'s routine and do not resent it. Thus I am very satisfied. My routine is to pick it up about 5 PM, sit and work on it for three to five minutes WHILE I watch TV. WHAT? You cry! Why so much work! The work is there because the robot does its job. All you are doing is making sure it keeps doing the job without hassle. Once again, whatever nonsense if advertised, I imagine ALL robots require this kind of looking after. PLAN on it. This one I suspect is no better or worse than any other. Do not go into it blind though. Here is what you need to know: a. You will need a little tool to do maintenance. If you buy the little kit with filters, brushes and a tool in it, know this. The tool is a hokey little plastic thing that CAN work... but takes a bit more time to use. Specifically it has a comb to clear tangle in your brushes. This works well. It has a little brush to brush dust off filters, off the inside of the dust/dirt collection box, etc. This works adequately. It ALSO has a little razor blade letter opener thing on one side intended to clear hair from rotors (Two types) This is a weak tool that works, but is time consuming and tedious to use. You are better off getting a little tool with steel blade or hook on it. Something you can use to really dig hair out of spots where it winds itself around a brush or rotor. Dig through your kitchen drawers, tool boxes or the $2.00 bins a the hardware store until you find something that works better for you. Maintenance: Enemy number one if long hairs. I have two women in the house. I am sure they do not mean to shed, but shed it they do somehow. This is what happens. As the little brushes turn they pick up hair and push some of it into the bin...BUT they also wind around and around the spinning brushes. Every other cleaning I find a wad of it around both brushes. There is also a rotor on the bottom the turns and does the sweeping up.. It ALSO picks up long hairs. Some will wind around the rotor proper and must be cut off or pulled off. This is the easy part. The hard part is that some will wind around at the ends where the bristles stop. This is where the recommended tool I mentioned will pay for itself as the hair tends to knot up tight in wind after wind. You will have to dig it out and cut it loose. You must also empty the bin at the same time. I also wash the bin out now and then along with the filter. Once a month or month and half the front wheel may also need to be tugged out (It pulls out and pushed back in easily) It ALSO gets hair down in there around its axle, though not nearly as fast as the rotors and brushes do. That is it. I will only close by saying I have NOT owned every robot in the world, but I imagine these periodic maintenance requirements will be very similar for ANY robot... NOT just this one, so if my maintenance picture here appear to be too gloomy, don\\'t let it be.  OVERALL: I am totally sold on having a slave machine keep my floors swept. Rather it than me! Call me lazy bones. A little maintenance now and then is well worth this machine. Go ahead and buy one.

       "      'body': 'Background: I have a shedding dog, so I bought this in hopes that by running it every-day, it would pick up on some of the dog hair on the floor.  What I like: -VERY easy to use. -easy to follow instructions -has a sticker on the bottom so if it ever stops and beeps, you can flip it over and it says exactly what the beeps mean (one beep means one thing, two beeps means another--which is SUPER helpful!). -color on top clearly shows what mode it is in (blue-ready to go, orange-needs to charge, red-problem to fix-such as emptying the tray). -very quiet. I can work on stuff with it in the room and it does not bother me at all (my dog also does not mind it). -works great on white carpet and easily transitions from my living room to dining room (which has a slight bump). -when its low on battery, it does not die where it is at, it just turns off the vacuum then finds the home doc and charges itself. -just works really well. I run it everyday and I am impressed by how much stuff it gets (especially when it goes under things such as the couch). -if it gets caught on a cord, it usually takes 5-10 seconds but then it stops the suctioning and moves away (releasing the cord or other item). However if you have a small cord you should put it up (and you should regardless, I just noticed it doing this a few times and thought it was neat, but I do try to pick up all cords).  What could be improved: -nothing really in particular to this. -It does not work well on anything black, but this is true for all robot vacuums. It sometimes gets stuck when it goes on the black carpet we have with the black chairs (I suspect because it can not detect them), but this has not happened often. My dog has a black mat for her food and water and it always bumps into it and spills the water, but again, this would occur with any robot vacuum. -Also, make sure the doc is against a wall because otherwise it will move and never charge (self explanatory, but I did not do the first time and it kept trying to doc and was just pushing the doc around the floor). -Finally, you do have to dump out the vacuum particles almost every time you run it (if you do a full circle/battery cycle). It is really easy to dump and beeps when it needs to be emptied. Again, nothing really negative, just something to note.  Overall, I really like this! It does a nice job cleaning up the dog hair and other things that get on my floor and saves me a lot of time not vacuuming daily. If you have a dog, I would watch them with this first before you use it. My dog was initially scared of it but sniffed it\\'s \"butt\" and now they are cool and she does not mind it at all. Pleased with this product and would recommend! :)  **UPDATE** On another note, Eufy has amazing customer service! I received an email from them addressing each of my \"what could be improved\" components with more information on the product. Very impressed.',\n",

The $139 Eufy has made my entry into the world of robotic cleaning a good experience. In the past, I have relied on Rubbermaid\\'s (Commercial) Microfibre 18\" mop and Bona hardwood cleaner. I still do for spills and mopping my upstairs hardwoods and vinyl planks on the ground floor.  This modest Eufy 11s Max does a great job of picking up the cat hairs from 4 furry friends, tracked cat litter, dust and all the rest of the debris that magically accumulates on 3k sq. ft. of flooring. Its cleaning power improves and eases the way for any subsequent wet mop scenario.  - Excellent along baseboards and thresholds, hardwoods, vinyl planking, under sofas - Quiet - Automatically increases suction power on carpets (iQ) - The remote control allows me to easily direct the 11s Max to different rooms I want to clean - Very good at avoiding falling down stairs - Renewable parts on this unit are easily available and reasonably priced - Ricochets around like a drunk...but knows its way \"home!\" - Source of endless fascination for the cats  -Not so good on Persian, Afghan or Caucasian carpets with fringe. (I fold them up or, in some cases, tuck the fringe under the carpet ends. I prefer to use a good vacuum with less brush action on fine carpets.) But the Eufy does a nice job on the underside of carpets, especially along the edges where dust, hair and debris seem to gather. Again, this is where the \"manual\" dimension of the remote control proves to be an actual advantage.  I\\'m learning to clean, then shift boxes and other obstacles out of the way to allow other areas to get a better cleaning in alternate \"Auto\" sessions.  My eyes and my bare feet tell me the Eufy 11s Max is doing a good cleaning job. The amount of cat hair in the disposal tray seconds that conclusion.  It may not be the smartest, most powerful or \"very best\" robo vacuum you can buy but its great performance and $139 price tag speak to me.  Unfortunately, it hasn\\'t been able to explain why cats prefer hurling hairballs on my carpets instead of the hard flooring.',\n",

       "      'body': 'My previous Shark IQ self empty was having issues so it was time for a replacement. With some research it was clear that the Eufy was considered one of the better self emptying robots especially at the price point. This robot does not work with magnetic strips as my previous robot did and has a very high-pitch sound when it runs. The noise is pretty obnoxious despite the level of suction you have it set to and my fiancé requests that i don’t run it when we’re home. The app is easy to use, gives realtime map tracking, connects easily, it seems to adapt well to furniture and layout changes, and it gives you 120 minutes of battery life per clean. I also appreciate that it doesn’t run into walls, furniture, cabinets, etc. Our biggest complaint is how loud it is compared to our previous robot but it handles dog hair well and clearly does a good job so we’re just putting up with it lol',\n",

       "      'body': \"I just renovated a 1960s rancher, and had to move in while reno was still ongoing. Needless to say, there was and is lots of dust. To add to the mix, I have three cats whose favorite hobby is shedding. A 60 year old, self-avowed cat lady, I could not keep up with the dust and hair. I had a Shark robo vac which I used on a carpeted floor. It did not do a great job, and I was constantly getting messages that Lurch's sidewheel was stuck, usually under a king sized bed. I would have to rake it out from under with a golf club. The Shark also left cat hair in the carpet. I took the Shark, along with my three cats, to my Florida condo where there was no carpet. The Shark still got stuck, could never find its dock, and just didn't do a great job cleaning.  This Eufy beats that Shark like a drum! I have no carpet in this house, but do have a couple of washable rugs. Eufy does a great job on the LVP, hardwoods, and rugs alike. The only time it has gotten stuck was when it sucked up an electrical cord. Its bumper is more sensitive than the Shark's, so Eufy doesn't push lightweight items around.  Eufy was easy to set up, and did a good 30 minute run right out of the box. There's a remote control with it, and a nifty tool for cleaning the brush. The instruction book is a bit vague on what all you can get it to do, and the icons in the book didn't match up with the ones on the remote, but I haven't used the remote for it yet, as it runs perfectly by just pushing the go button on Eufy's back.  It sucks up and collects all the cat hair it can find, and is still getting its share of construction gerbis. I thought I would never be able to walk barefoot in this house, but Eufy has changed that!  Eufy finds its dock when the charge gets low. Its low profile enables it to get under sofas and chairs.  The collection tank is easy to empty and clean. The brush is easy to remove, and the tool makes for easy and quick cleaning of it.  Eufy is reasonably quiet.  My only complaint is that Eufy doesn't sense stairs and drop offs like my old Shark. The first time I turned Eufy on, it raced straight for the sun room doors, and over the edge-a good 6 inch drop-and landed on its back like a dying bug. The construction is strong enough to withstand the drop, but I block off that opening when Eufy is now on the job.  Eufy's full charge gives a long run time that will clean a good 1000 feet of space.  Overall, Eufy is a powerful little vac, and well worth the price. There's no app, like with the Shark, but you can set it to run with the remote.  If you have hard floors and pets, don't hesitate to get this thing!  Caveat: I cannot attest to how much cat weight Eufy will support, as I cannot get mine to ride it.\",\n",

       "      'body': 'At first, I loved this little thing, and like many named it (Gary). It was impressive how every day it had a tray with a bunch of dust and dog hair in it. In my experience with vacuums and electronics, your product will last much longer if you take good care of it. Before going to bed, I \"Gary proof\" the house, picking up any random charging cables, socks, etc, and putting the dogs up so they don\\'t have an accident streaked all over the house. I run it early morning at 2am. I empty the tray every morning, which takes less than a minute. Every week or so, usually monday morning, I spend less than 5 minutes to take the side brushes and roller off, and remove any hair/strings. This is probably much more frequently than you HAVE to do it, but with my experience in maintenance, I prefer to do it more often and regularly.  He\\'s a dumb vacuum, and occasionally gets stuck in weird places, or will grab a low hanging wire and get caught up, but it\\'s a good thing he\\'s dumb. We don\\'t have true AI, so spending a ton on special sensors and algorithms to pretend that a smarter vacuum has been created, is just a waste of money. When looking at reviews for all the major robovac brands, they all get stuck occasionally and have issues. I don\\'t care that Gary sometimes gets stuck, because it doesn\\'t happen too frequently. A dumb robovac that runs regularly and has a decent battery life will make for a much cleaner home, and with much less effort, than vacuuming on my own. Will it sometimes miss a spot? Sure, but it eventually gets to it. Are there spots it can\\'t get to? Yes, but those are spots that I\\'d have to get the hose and attachments out for anyways. Up to this point, I\\'d give this vacuum 5 stars. It\\'s effective, and at a much more reasonable price than the competition. It does everything I need, and doesn\\'t have a lot of extra crap thrown in there. So, why 3 stars then?  It\\'s not durable. There is something wrong in the design of the roller brush, or the containment of the roller brush, and it starts making a loud vibrating noise after a few months. I purchased it in May of 2018, and by August it was ridiculously loud. After a bunch of minor tests, that were already answered and then ignored in my initial email, and video I provided of how loud it was, they agreed it was faulty. Anker/Eufy sent me a replacement, after I sent mine back. They let me keep the extra accessories, such as the spare side brushes, the hair removal tool, and even the charging dock, and sent me what appeared to be a brand new robovac, packaging and accessories just like it ships from Amazon. It\\'s now February, and the robovac is making the same loud noise again. I\\'ve done some extra troubleshooting on my own, and narrowed it down to the brush, or brush holder. As it\\'s spinning, it\\'s vibrating. All of the contact points are plastic. If I take the brush out, it stops vibrating. I put some thin foam tape between the enclosure of the brush and the plastic casing that holds it in, to see if the brush was causing it to vibrate. That didn\\'t stop the sound. It\\'s like the brush is bouncing around in it\\'s housing. It looks like the spinning brush wears away at the casing that holds it in place. I don\\'t see a way to repair it on my own, or to prevent it from happening again. We\\'ll see how Anker handles the issue the second time. I\\'m not looking forward to dealing with it again, and I\\'m hesitant to recommend this to anyone else.  It\\'s important to note that I work from home, so running it during the day isn\\'t conducive to me working. When it\\'s working properly, it\\'s quiet enough to run at night and not be a bother. It will randomly bump into a door sometimes, so if you\\'re a light sleeper, it may be a problem, but for our family it\\'s not an issue. It\\'s only after it degrades and start making loud noises that it\\'s an issue. If you have an empty house during the day, and it wouldn\\'t matter if it\\'s extra loud when it runs, then it would work perfectly fine.  Edit:3/11/19 After some confusing back and forth with Eufy Support, they\\'ve replaced my 11S with a 30C and even through in some boundary strips. Initially they just wanted to replace it completely, but I was concerned that it would just break again, this time out of warranty. They offered to upgrade to the 30. After I sent it, another support rep reached out saying they should have troubleshot the robovac more, and not to send it in as they had some other tests to do and if that didn\\'t fix it, they could fix the roller. I let them know I already sent it. I asked if they could send me a 30C so I\\'d get wifi as well, and I\\'d pay the difference. They said they couldn\\'t ship the 30C because Amazon owned it. While waiting for my robovac to get to them, the 35C came out, and it\\'s listed for sale from their website. I asked if that could be sent instead, and again I\\'d pay the difference. They said they couldn\\'t, but they\\'d ship an extra boundary set for the confusion earlier. I thought they said they\\'d send the 30C, not the 30, so responded that would be good. They cleared it up saying they could send the 30 with an extra boundary strip or the 30C without it. I chose 30C without. They decided to send the 30C and the extra boundary strip! Way over the top support, trying to make me happy. I wasn\\'t upset, or being a jerk about it, they were just extremely accommodating. Based on the great customer support (minus minor confusions, some on my part) I\\'m bumping it up to a 5 star. They really stand behind their products. I also think any future issues that may pop up can be alleviated with troubleshooting the roller brush, which should be replaced occasionally anyways.',\n",

       "      'body': 'I always thought these robot vacs were kind of a silly gimmick, too expensive for not enough gain. After a couple friends raved about their robovac\\'s, I made excuses like \"My home layout is too complex!\" and \"I\\'ll need three of them to vacuum my home!\" But, the robot wars have made them cheaper and better, so I decided to finally give in on a good deal with this new model from a well trusted brand. I wasn\\'t willing to pay for units with home mapping features and no-go zones, but with this unit, I don\\'t feel I even need it. Turns out, I am absolutely thrilled with the performance and price point of these Eufy\\'s.  There is little doubt this unit is just slightly smarter than a bag of hammers. Thank goodness I can make it do it\\'s work at 4AM when I don\\'t care how many times it goes over the same spot or misses something that is just \"right over there you stupid bleeping robot!\" But, day after day, this hunk of electronic sensors strapped to a vacuum comes home with a bin full of stuff. I\\'m at the point where I don\\'t even know where it gets the stuff and I\\'m seriously questioning my ability to clean my house. And also somewhat ashamed of the filth that I\\'ve lived with and didn\\'t even know about.  It goes places it probably shouldn\\'t and if you have any degree of OCD, it will hurt your brain to watch it. It goes under furniture and shelving where it barely manages to escape, plays ping pong with table/chair legs for a bit and it has an inexplicable infatuation with the clear storage totes under my guest bed. It\\'ll really like one area/room for awhile, but then will go elsewhere, only to be back 2 minutes later...and you\\'re like, \"Well, that was the *least* efficient way to do that. Whatever, a goldfish is smarter than you.\" Whenever I\\'m in the kitchen doing something, it has the whole lower floor it could be cleaning, but it will insist several times on cleaning the spot right under my feet. It loves to chase my cats and in turn, my cats will engage it in a battle of home domination, swatting it and trying to eat the spinny brushes while it charges. One cat will lay on the lower step and lazily swat at it as it goes by. Just when you think there might be the slightest sense of intelligence and you\\'re having this \"It\\'s alive!\" moment, it reminds you how dumb it is by gently ramming itself into a piece of furniture. I don\\'t know how it does it, but despite looking like it couldn\\'t find it\\'s way out of a paper bag, it somehow manages to find home base for charging most of the time.  But, it gets around, even in an ever changing layout. It deals with my wood floors, several area rugs and a section of medium pile carpet without much incident. It hasn\\'t once tried to go over a stair in my home. It gets probably a good 70%+ of a complex, 1,000 square foot U-shaped layout of my main floor, with plenty of furniture making navigation much worse. But, it does that 70%+ every day and I don\\'t even have to think about it. Based on the sheer amount of cat hair and dust this thing picks up daily, I\\'d say the suction and pickup mechanisms are pretty good. I can\\'t tell you if they\\'re better than older Eufy or other branded units, but the spec\\'s say so.  I was worried about how much of my lifestyle I\\'d have to change to adapt to this thing. Turns out, very little. I can still leave stuff around if I want and it won\\'t try to eat everything in its path. It does occasionally try to commit robot death on various cat toys the kitties leave about, but that\\'s maybe one 1 out of 10 times it needs saving. I have a rug in my kitchen that it loves to push into a pile, but that\\'s only a minor annoyance and doesn\\'t cause it harm. I have to be careful not to leaving charging cords and such about. Once every couple weeks it won\\'t find it\\'s way all the way home, but it\\'s usually pretty darn close to the charging station by the time it dies. I thought it might become inconvenient to \"save\" the unit from it\\'s self-inflicted stupidity, but the value it provides exceeds the inconvenience.  I can see why people like these things. And there\\'s a good chance I may buy the three I need, maybe this one or maybe others. But, for now I\\'m pretty happy with this one. It\\'s a 5 out of 5 cat toy and a pretty useful home appliance that will save you time and improve your home\\'s upkeep. I\\'ll update this review with any significant changing opinions, but for now this \"dumb, smart thing\" gets 5 stars.  Update: About 4 months after running this thing daily, one of the side brush motors started to malfunction. Normally, a product malfunctioning that soon would irk me to reducing my review stars immediately, but I sucked it up and contacted support. I requested, specifically, to do a self repair of the brush motor right out of the gate. They didn\\'t request for me to send it in for repair, demand an expensive cross shipped replacement or question my self-assessment to repair equipment that I owned. They just told me they have the part in stock, requested I send them a video of the problem, asked for the address and put the brush motor in the mail. They then confirmed that if this didn\\'t make it work right, they would still support me until it did. They worked with me exactly how I wanted them to, stood behind their product 100% and for that, not even a single star will be reduced from my original review.  Update 2: I knocked two stars from my review. Not because of the unit, which is still great, but because of the replacement air filters. They are $11 for TWO of them! That\\'s nearly 3 times the price of the previous filters, or about a $65 annual operating cost when changing them out once a month. IMO, that\\'s simply too expensive for a vacuum and even my high end upright isn\\'t nearly that expensive to operate using *HEPA grade* vacuum bags. Not just that, they are incredibly terrible for the environment by requiring you to buy the substantial plastic filter housing every time. Had I known this at the time of my purchase, I would have selected a different unit - probably the initial version of the 11S.  Final Update: I\\'ve decided to just let this thing die a slow and painful death. Both of my side brush motors went out, as did the one that I replaced. It\\'s still marginally effective without them, but definitely not as good as having them. Eufy\\'s support reached out to me several times, which was great, but I have better things to do than rip this thing apart every few months to fix plastic parts that will fail again in 3 months. I expect more from something I\\'m paying $200+ for, definitely not three of the same exact failures within a year. Oh, and there\\'s much cheaper 3rd party filters available for this guy now.',\n",

Has cut way down on the daily sweeping chore. I really like that it goes under the furniture (most of my furniture). Easy to empty and I do so when it occurs to me and is convenient to do so. It has yet to \"ask me\" to be emptied. I probably do it once a week or so when doing other chores. Quietest vacuum I\\'ve ever had (though also the smallest). Con: Doesn\\'t get all the way into the corners, so one has to weep the corners out once in a while. Can get stuck under some furniture (in my case where I have a tapered toe kick board under a book case that it can sometimes wedge itself into). Has problems with electric cords and strings. Keep your space picked-up (just like Mommy told you to (in fairness, one has to do that for a regular vacuum as well)). As it moves randomly, it can take some time to vacuum a space thoroughly.',\n",

       "      'body': \"This (really long) review is for the Eufy 11S Max robot vacuum (Robovac). Please note “Max” vs regular 11S. They may look the same; but the Max uses a different filter and has the higher 2000pa suction. Otherwise the functions and options (other than suction choices) are the same. I've used the 11S Max for the last month on my low pile carpet (about 80% of the roaming area) with the rest being tile or linoleum flooring. It has been quite fascinating to watch so I've actually put about 85-90 charge cycles on the unit over the last month (yes, three times a day on most days and it's still finding more dirt/dust than I would expect).  Right up front, I'd definitely buy another when it comes time to replace this one. After comparing how I vacuum my flooring, especially to pick up my biggest carpet enemy; short stray bits of dried grass stems, the “random” wandering of this vacuum model made more sense to me than the other fancier choices. Most vacs do a good job with dust, dirt, sand, cheerios, etc. but these stem pieces are only picked up by a vacuum when it comes at the stem with the brush roller pretty much parallel to the stem. That means random directions will more likely get these pesky problems than an organized back & forth cleaning approach. Granted it may take a few cleaning cycles or several passes over the same area during one cycle; but since the Robovac has completed its first 5-6 cycles I rarely find them anymore or if I do spot one it's not for very long.  Robovac is a big time saver as well as an energy saver for me. I would use my canister vacuum about an hour each week for routine cleaning and once a month for 2+ hours to do a more thorough cleaning. A watt-hour meter indicated that my canister vacuum used 5-6 kw-hr of electricity each month. Robovac uses about 12 watts continuously for about 4 hours when charging (surprisingly less than the 5-6 hrs listed in the manual; but it is brand new). Once the battery is charged, the power consumption drops to about ½ watt. When Robovac is away cleaning, the charging base uses just ¼ watt for the homing beacon. So if used just once a day; Robovac would only use about 60 watts per day. That means once-a-day cleaning would only use 1.8 Kw-hr energy per month. By letting Robovac take over the regular weekly cleaning with once a day operation (or less), I'm able to cut my electric bill by an easy 3-4 kw-hr/month.  With that said, there are a few things that I think need improved:  First, there should be an interlock on the dust bin – Robovac will merrily go off about it's scheduled cleaning cycle without the bin installed! So if removed for emptying; don't forget to re-install the bin before the next scheduled operation. Plus, I noticed on a couple occasions, that I wasn't paying attention and I left one corner was about 1/8” out from fully inserted. Not sure if that will cause suction leaks; but you need to make sure the bin is completely inserted.  Second, you can't select “max” (or any power level) when using the remote to manually clean an area. It appears to only operate on “standard” suction with manual operation (i.e., when Robovac is not running a regular cleaning mode and you chose to override it's direction). In addition, if you select the remotes' edge or spot cleaning modes it will automatically go to “max” power for the duration of that mode and you can't choose IQBoost or standard power level on those selections.  Third, I don't know why the 20 minutes for edge cleaning or 30 minutes for quick cleaning was selected. Robovac can make it about 60-70% around my home in the 20 minutes of edge cleaning. If edge cleaning mode was permitted to run until it made a trip all way around and back to the charging station where it could dock to finish that mode would work better. An alternate solution would be if I could set the cycle time for edge cleaning and quick cleaning modes. Plus I'd like having an option for it to simply stop when the time is up rather than automatically returning to the base. When I want just one room cleaned; I'll set Robovac to auto or quick mode in that room, then close the door or put down a barrier, and return later to stop it manually and take it back to the charging base. If I don't return in a timely manner Robovac will be trying to locate the charging base and running the battery down.  Fourth, Robovac cleans edges using only its right side pretty much all of the time. It would be helpful to have it randomly choose using either the right or left side whenever edge cleaning. I watched it edge clean a carpet/wall area three times going only in a counterclockwise direction (right side) and it still didn't pick up all the dust bunnies. I used manual control with it hugging the wall on its left side and it picked them up with no problem. Also, be aware that manual operation, when Robovac is not already working in a selected cleaning mode (overriding current movement), only works while the remote buttons are pressed. Robovac stops all functions shortly after a button is released when used manually.  Fifth, I really don't need to run Robovac on a daily schedule – there should be a weekly scheduling capability even for the least expensive robot vacuums. It shouldn't be that difficult or expensive to update this model to correct this issue. Even if it's the same set cleaning time, every day for the selected days; just give me the ability to schedule cleaning cycles one to seven times a week.  Sixth, when the battery runs low, Robovac can take forever, if it makes it back at all, to the charging base. I will routinely go looking for it if I haven't seen it return within 10-15 minutes after the approximate cleaning time has passed. The age-old solution for solving a maze (your home from Robovacs' perspective) is to constantly follow along obstacles using just one side (Robovac does recognize when it's circling something like a coffee table and adjusts accordingly after a 360 degree rotation). This method is how Robovac tries getting closer to the charging station when it's more than about 15ft away and not in line-of-sight (the charging base emits an infrared signal for homing action – make sure you keep Robovacs' bumper and the base clean). Sometimes Robovac occasionally gets diverted or the software tells it to try something different) and it will go off in another (often wrong) direction (extremely frustrating!). I highly recommend observing Robovac perform it's return operation from various areas in your home. I ended up placing a 2x4 along the end legs of my sofa as Robovac was consistently going along the side skirt, under the skirt at front of the sofa, then around the front leg exiting the side of the skirt, and then heading straight across the room. It would then go thru three other rooms and come back to the sofa again. The 2x4 forced Robovac to continue edging under the sofa, along the back wall, and out the other end which has an end table that mimics the 2x4 at the opposite end. Before using the 2x4, Robovac took well over an hour to get back to the charging base (it eventually changes up it's routine, usually after three tries) and required 5 hrs to recharge. With the 2x4, Robovac has been able to get back from the far end of my house to the charging base in under 20 minutes very consistently. While the ability to improve Robovacs' return mode is really limited to what you can do, the key point I'm making here is that the battery will always give you more charge cycles (longer life) before needing replacement if you can get Robovac back to the charging base as soon possible.  Seventh, pay attention to the thin rubber wiping strip on the brush guard. After 60+ cycles I noticed the ends of the thin rubber strip (about 1/16” of it's height) were tearing away. I believe this was most likely due to moving back and forth over edging from tile/linoleum to carpet or maybe due to the floor mounted furnace registers in my home. I simply trimmed the torn bits off to keep them from getting caught by the brush. After about 100 cycles I noted the rest of the 1/16” strip was now gone. This impacts the tile/linoleum cleaning far more than carpet; but it is something to watch for. I highly recommend checking the rubber strip during brush cleaning and purchasing a brush guard replacement as part of a maintenance set. Hopefully the manufacturer will improve the thickness or type of material used to prevent or at least reduce this problem occurring in the future.  Next, a few helpful hints I've learned or didn't find in the owner's manual:  The “bowl” shape on top of the charging base with the white LED is just right to hold the remote control, button-side up. However, I prefer to turn remote controls' button-side down to keep them cleaner so it's up to you if you use it or not.  I've had a few occasions when Robovac actually bumped into the charging base so it was no longer sitting square against the wall. This will impact it's ability to find the base when the battery is low. I took a used rectangular-shaped one quart motor oil bottle from my recycling bin, cleaned it thoroughly, and filled it with sand. It's now a 3-4lb weight sitting on top of the charging base. I haven't had the base re-positioned since adding the weight. Normally Robovac does a good job avoiding the charging base; but not always.  Robovac “parks” about 1/2” away from the charging base tower. If you are careful, you can swipe a cloth over the bumper sensors to clean off any surface dust that has collected (always seems to be some); however, be careful as Robovac might activate while you are doing this. You might also get a solid red indicator without any beeps. This error isn't described in the manual; but I've found if I just lift Robovac off the charging base for few seconds and then replace it, it will change back to the charging orange color. (I suspect the solid red indicates a sensor error) It's also quite easy to remove/replace the dust bin during charging. Unfortunately you will need to flip Robovac on it's back to remove/clean the side and roller brushes as well as the bottom IR sensors and charging contacts, so remember to turn Robovac off with the topside button before doing this or get used to it trying to start up while you are cleaning it. Also make sure the blue/orange indicator light is on when you reposition it on the base. Sometimes Robovac will remain off rather than return to charging mode.  After two or three cleaning cycles I'll do a regular check on the all the brushes and swap left and right side brushes when they are re-installed; seems to straighten and make them work a little better, maybe last longer too.  Oddly the remote control spot clean button symbol and the manual indicate a clockwise spiral for the cleaning operation; but when I've selected it, Robovac has always used a counterclockwise rotation.  If the side brushes happen to “hang up” on something, Robovac will stop spinning them while it maneuvers around the obstacle and then restart the brushes when it thinks it is clear. Don't assume there's a problem when you see this unless Robovac beeps and the indicator turns red.  The flat handle end of a spoon or fork works great for prying the filter free from the bin for cleaning. Every time I have tried using my fingers; it pops out tossing dust/lint everywhere.  The IQBoost mode doesn't seem to change going from hard flooring to low pile carpet or vice versa in my home. I think this is because the low pile carpet just doesn't cause enough “drag” for it to recognize that it could adjust the suction level. (I'm still not clear as to whether there's just two suction levels or if Robovac can vary linearly between the two) While the manual indicates a 40 min run time in “max” mode with medium nap carpet, I'm obtaining about 60 minutes with my low nap carpet. I do find the “max” mode clearly picks up more dust. I ran Robovac 20+ times on IQ mode before switching to “max” for its scheduled operation. The filter has clearly shown a thicker layer of accumulation on the filter.  When “max” mode is set as default you will occasionally hear the vacuum whining noise change briefly. Best I can figure is it's a software glitch where the IQBoost code tries to adjust the suction level; but then resets it to max. I normally hear this shortly after Robovac goes from one flooring type to another. It also occurs shortly after it starts it's routine.  Robovac does not communicate back to the remote. So if for instance, you press edge cleaning and Robovac doesn't get the message, the remote will show it should be performing edge cleaning even though it's not. Similar situation when Robovac is recharging or is returning to recharge; the remote will still show it's in the selected cleaning mode rather than the “charging” icon. You simply have to pay attention that Robovac has recognized your command by a “beep”.  I found using the basketball nozzle with my Ryobi P737 inflator does an excellent job cleaning the filter. It takes only a couple minutes to clean both the filter and the bin (outdoors of course!). The original filter has been cleaned well over 100 times now and other than being a little dingy it's still working great. This should help stretch the recommended replacement interval to more than 2 months compared to the recommended “tapping it” to clean. Do not use the “canned” compressed air as I frequently find it wets surfaces during extended spraying and the Robovac filter is a paper element.  If you have a sofa, chair, etc, with stiff or heavy cloth skirting down to the floor; I suggest safety pinning up at least a foot or two of the skirting on an open side. When or if Robovac switches to using the proximity mode for cleaning AFTER it gets under the furniture, the skirt will appear like a wall and it will keep running around underneath the furniture until it switches to a collision mode where the weight of the skirt generally will not trip the bumper sensors and stop it from escaping.  I'm glad I've used Robovac during the daytime so I could track it down and figure out what trouble it got into during its normal operation or when I expected it to be back at the charging base. The alarm beep sounds can easily be missed when it's far away from you. Plus, when it powers down after getting stuck can make it lot more challenging to find! It's a lot easier to locate when the vacuum sound is still going or even if it's just the quieter wheel motors running it around looking for the charging base.  To wrap up my review. I've found Robovac to be a well built, nicely designed, and quite durable robot vacuum. The $160 price I paid is quite reasonable with excellent cleaning ability (given it has about 1/10 the suction of a typical canister vac). It has good battery run times (my mixed flooring on IQ mode lets Robovac run about 80-85 minutes before recharging), and it is a wonderful time and energy saver. If you've been thinking about a robot vacuum without all the extras (or just don't like vacuuming), the Eufy 11S Max is a great choice.\",\n",

       "     {'title': 'Over a year in use... study this review for real analysis',\n",
       "      'body': 'Summary: I read a LOT of reviews about a LOT of products of a similar nature before I leapt in to buy this, my first robot. Overall, this product was good SOLID value for the money.  I have now owned it for for OVER a year now, used daily and this analysis is based on close observations during that period. NOT one of those folks who buy it an write a review five minutes after they pull something out of the box. Here are the key points you should consider when buying a Robot to sweep your floors.  1. Price - Look...Price was definitely a consideration at buy in. I studied many models before I bought this one. These kinds of robots overall cost money. $$$. Of course, I am old school. These days some folks buy a Cell phone that cost $500 dollars to $1000 and think nothing of it. To me that is WAY too much. Ditto many models of similar robots. At the time I bought it the robot was on sale so I got a price that was $100 cheaper than competitors whose reviews read about the same as this one did. So the buy in pricewise was a good solid deal that was in what I consider the medium to upper low cost affordability range. Perhaps you would think nothing of spending $850 on a robot. Not me. Like goldilocks, this one was just right. SECRET Costs you may not think about: Some reviews address this, but consider these things as being costs IN ADDITION to buy in: Filters: This thing has a filter. I recall one review whining that filters cost too much. Let me be clear. If you want a new HEPA filter for it every week or two, they will cost you. Me? The filter does not seem to me to very critical since I do not really plan on the robot cleaning my air. It gets dirty and dusty. As a result, I pull it every other use and wash it out under a faucet in my kitchen (a two minute job), let it dry a bit and then put it right back in the machine (Which is super easy to do...no tools or anything - just pull out - click in.) After reading one alarmist review prior to buying, I bought one spare filter at the same time I bought the robot thinking I might find it was true. So far, after a year or more of use, I STILL have not replaced the filter. Just keep using the original. Think about it. Brushes - I bought a kit with spare brushes when I bought the robot. Glad I did. Buy at least one set just to you have them around when you need them. The brushes twirl around and shove cat hair into the maw of the thing as it races around. Somewhere. Somehow, as it toodled about around the six month mark, it threw a brush. (They snap on and off easily) Like a horse throwing a shoe, this is to be expected. This thing runs all over on its own so I could not find where it lost it. To this day I STILL have not found the missing brush. No problem. I just grabbed a spare, snapped it on and it kept on going. Tools - The kit I bought early came with a little cleaning/maintenance tool. See my section on Maintenance below about tools.  2. Utility - Utility to me means ease of use. Based on a year of hard use for my robot you should consider the following lessons learned about utility: CLEANING FLOORS a. Does is really sweep ALL the floor? Read a lot of reviews and looked at a variety of designs. Some reviews that I recall said \"This thing finds a LOT of dirt. Where does it get it all?\" After a year of emptying it (You DO need to empty its evening sweep into your trash, usually every day - VERY easy to do - again click out- click in) I totally agree! This thing finds a TON of dirt and dust that is NOT obvious to the naked eye. Frankly, that is its job and I need to make clear here that it does its job really really well. VERY SATISFIED b. To be utter clear however... I have a three story house. To define that though that is two stories with WOODEN and some tile Floors and a third floor that is mixed wood, carpet and concrete. PRO: I cheat. One robot for three floors of my house! Every day or two I pick it up from its charger, move it from floor to floor to let it clean a different floor whenever the mood strikes me. Works great! More, this thing cleans almost all of those floors flawlessly - especially the wood, tile and concrete bits. It sneaks into lots and lots of corners, under furniture and stuff and it never, ever runs off the edge of stairs. Completely satisfied. I admit I may be so satisfied because wood, tile and concrete are 92% of my floors and it is flawless on those types of floors. CON: This is a real review, not a feel good propaganda babble. If there is a con to this robot it is carpets. Specifically, it WILL work across modern carpet. That is carpet that is tight, laid level with the rest of the floor and has nothing to hang it up on. However, it struggles to go over edges, so if there is an edge to your carpet, a strip that it has to ride up over OR (Like me) you have a carpet or two that are Persian Style rugs with tassels at the end, just be advised that it WILL choke as it tries to cross these barriers. You can still do these surfaces, but you will have to stay nearby and bail it out when/if it hangs up... which feels time wasting. This should not make you hesitate to buy based on this review UNLESS you have a lot of these carpet barrier things about your house, in which case you will be annoyed by this robot. To be fair however, you may be annoyed by ANY robot under those conditions. Just think about it before you buy. ******** Utility NOTE! This is a final note on utility. The REAL Nemesis of any robot is WIRES/Cords. Once you own one, you will figure this out pretty quick. You will need to get your cords under control since the robots will find power cords on computers, lamps etcetera and choke up on them. 80% of the time when it does not return to its charger at after you program it to clean (Smart folks program that between 1AM and 3AM - unless you tell it to go manually for some reason) you will have to track it down to find it hung up on wires. Once again, to be fair, I think this is true of virtually all robots. They are not too bright about wires. The other 20% of hang-ups comes from some oddity in your furniture. I have particular chair in my study whose side supports are JUST a bit too short for the robot to go under, so it drive in there and wedges itself into the spot and cannot get free on its own. Just to you know, this is fair enough, robot makers cannot anticipate every single possible piece of odd furniture. Just figure it out through trial and error, but enjoy all the cleaning it does WITHOUT you paying the slightest attention. A small price to pay. *********Utility NOTE 2: The control - Comes with a remote. To be frank, I only use two or three features on the control. I tested them all at the beginning, but I\\'ve forgotten what the rest do. Most used? Manual use button. Because of how I use it on other floors, the automatic run feature is only good on one floor. Works flawlessly as far as I can see. I tote it to the second floor, put it down, hit the manual timed button and off it goes. I wander back up an hour two later, hit the off button and walk it back to its charger. Second most used? The recharge button - This tells it got back to recharge station manually. If you you do not want it to keep going you can interrupt its cycle and it will go back to its recharging. Usually use this when I am watching a show, it starts on its own and I find the noise distracts me from watching. Third most used feature? The manual steering controls. One review I read said this machine is really stupid. That is half true. It does fine most of the time, but if you want to steer it manually on occasion you can. I have a table I want to make sure it does under in a certain way, so I just point and click it to drive it into the bits when I want them to be cleaned.  3. Maintenance - Look. Old soldiers will tell you. Preventative maintenance will allow you to keep using your equipment day in and day out. This robot IS reliable IF you know you will need to maintain it! If you are lazy you will hate doing maintenance. I just make it part of day\\'s routine and do not resent it. Thus I am very satisfied. My routine is to pick it up about 5 PM, sit and work on it for three to five minutes WHILE I watch TV. WHAT? You cry! Why so much work! The work is there because the robot does its job. All you are doing is making sure it keeps doing the job without hassle. Once again, whatever nonsense if advertised, I imagine ALL robots require this kind of looking after. PLAN on it. This one I suspect is no better or worse than any other. Do not go into it blind though. Here is what you need to know: a. You will need a little tool to do maintenance. If you buy the little kit with filters, brushes and a tool in it, know this. The tool is a hokey little plastic thing that CAN work... but takes a bit more time to use. Specifically it has a comb to clear tangle in your brushes. This works well. It has a little brush to brush dust off filters, off the inside of the dust/dirt collection box, etc. This works adequately. It ALSO has a little razor blade letter opener thing on one side intended to clear hair from rotors (Two types) This is a weak tool that works, but is time consuming and tedious to use. You are better off getting a little tool with steel blade or hook on it. Something you can use to really dig hair out of spots where it winds itself around a brush or rotor. Dig through your kitchen drawers, tool boxes or the $2.00 bins a the hardware store until you find something that works better for you. Maintenance: Enemy number one if long hairs. I have two women in the house. I am sure they do not mean to shed, but shed it they do somehow. This is what happens. As the little brushes turn they pick up hair and push some of it into the bin...BUT they also wind around and around the spinning brushes. Every other cleaning I find a wad of it around both brushes. There is also a rotor on the bottom the turns and does the sweeping up.. It ALSO picks up long hairs. Some will wind around the rotor proper and must be cut off or pulled off. This is the easy part. The hard part is that some will wind around at the ends where the bristles stop. This is where the recommended tool I mentioned will pay for itself as the hair tends to knot up tight in wind after wind. You will have to dig it out and cut it loose. You must also empty the bin at the same time. I also wash the bin out now and then along with the filter. Once a month or month and half the front wheel may also need to be tugged out (It pulls out and pushed back in easily) It ALSO gets hair down in there around its axle, though not nearly as fast as the rotors and brushes do. That is it. I will only close by saying I have NOT owned every robot in the world, but I imagine these periodic maintenance requirements will be very similar for ANY robot... NOT just this one, so if my maintenance picture here appear to be too gloomy, don\\'t let it be.  OVERALL: I am totally sold on having a slave machine keep my floors swept. Rather it than me! Call me lazy bones. A little maintenance now and then is well worth this machine. Go ahead and buy one. Jump in the water\\'s fine.',\n",
