B0C2PNWDGZ,5,Perfect for Busy Homes!,"I've been using the ROPVACNIC Robot Vacuum Cleaner for a few days, and it has quickly become a favorite cleaning tool in my household. Here’s what I found: Suction Power: The 3000Pa cyclone suction power is genuinely impressive. It picks up everything from pet hair to small debris, and it doesn’t struggle with crumbs or dirt on hard floors or low-pile carpets. It even handles the edges and corners pretty well. Control Options: I love the flexibility with control options! You can manage it via the mobile app, voice commands (Alexa-compatible), or the included remote. The app is easy to use, with simple controls for scheduling, choosing cleaning modes, and viewing cleaning history. Self-Charging & Scheduling: The self-charging feature works flawlessly. When the battery is low, the vacuum automatically returns to its charging base, which saves a lot of hassle. Scheduling cleanings is straightforward through the app, which is excellent for staying on top of dust and pet hair. Pet-Friendly: With two cats and a dog, I was particularly concerned about how well this would handle pet hair. It’s been great so far! It doesn’t clog up, and the brushes are easy to clean, even when they get hair wrapped around them. Performance on Flooring: This vacuum shines on hard floors, and it handles low carpets well. It’s probably not ideal for thicker carpets, but if you have mostly hardwood or tile with a few low-pile rugs, it’s a great fit. What Could Be Better: It can get a little loud on maximum suction, though this is to be expected with higher-powered vacuums. The dustbin also fills up quickly if you have pets, so plan to empty it regularly. Overall: For the price, especially on this limited-time deal, the ROPVACNIC Robot Vacuum Cleaner offers fantastic value. It’s a reliable and versatile vacuum that tackles everyday messes well and integrates seamlessly into a busy household.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"
B0C2PNWDGZ,5,Perfect Little Helper for Daily Cleaning!,"I wasn’t sure what to expect with this robot vacuum, but wow, it’s been a lifesaver! The design is pretty modern and the build is decent for the price. Setting it up was a breeze, and it started cleaning right out of the box. I was skeptical about how much dirt it would pick up, but this little thing goes above and beyond, works well, and even picks up hair. It’s quiet enough that it doesn’t bother anyone, and the battery life is solid—I can usually get a full cleaning cycle on a single charge.

B0C2PNWDGZ,5,Amazing,"I absolutely love this vacuum! The automatic self-charging feature is a game changer—I never have to worry about it running out of battery mid-clean. I set up the scheduled cleaning, and it works like clockwork, keeping my house spotless every day. It’s especially great for pet hair, which was always a challenge to keep under control before. It glides effortlessly over my hard floors and even handles my low-pile carpet without a hitch. It’s surprisingly quiet, so it doesn’t scare my pets, and the dustbin is easy to empty. Overall, this vacuum has saved me so much time and effort. Highly recommend for anyone with pets or a busy lifestyle!","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024"

B0C2PNWDGZ,5,Great Value vacuum!,"I’m quite impressed with its performance. The suction power is strong, and it does a fantastic job picking up dust, pet hair, and crumbs from my hard floors and carpets. The multiple cleaning modes are convenient, and the app control makes scheduling easy. However, I do wish it had a mapping feature to make cleaning more efficient and thorough. Despite that, it’s still a great, budget-friendly option that delivers good value for the price.","Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2024"

B0C2PNWDGZ,5,A great robot vacuum at less than $150!,"Unboxing and First Impressions: Ropvacnic Robot Vacuum If you're in the market to give your self a periodic cleaning that will help you out BIG TIME!!! This robot vacuum is an impressive value that I’ve found... This helps frees your time and is NOT loaded with a lot of bells and whistles that don’t provide a lot of value. It vacuums great and is such a time saver. Packaging: packaging is great and has all the necessary items and extra brushes to help provide value. It will likely do 2 maybe 3 cleaning before you need to empty the dust bin but mind you, the more you empty it the better the suction. At this point it’s practically set it and forget it. I’m loving it!!! Installation: it’s practically Plug-and-Play Simplicity Unbox it and plug it in, let it charge fully and then you can letter suck!!! Pun intended haha. You’ll find all the necessary components already installed and charging base that of course needs to be plugged in! I do hope you find this useful enjoy!","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2024"

We have used it several times since receiving it a few days ago and love it! It really does a great job cleaning and fits in some pretty tight spaces! No issues with setting it up and it is able to find its home/dock without issue! I am so glad we decided to buy this vacuum! If you’re on the fence just get it! It has really been a life saver!

B0C2PNWDGZ,5,This thing ping pongs around the room...,After it ping pongs around long enough it can clean a bedroom. But how long does it take for a random pattern to cover everything? Aha! It seems to be going around the edges of multiple rooms now. My Husky doesn't know what to make of it... It does appear to have some smarts. It is going from room to room but by chance I believe. It did find its way back to the charger. Amazing. And it self charged. And the dust/hair receptacle had stuff in it that I emptied. 2nd day worked OK but got stuck under side table & sofa. Had to rescue it. Seems like a good buy.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2024"
B0C2PNWDGZ,5,Robot Vacuum Cleaner by ROPVACNIC,what a great robot vacuum cleaner! Its a good idea to read the material first to get to know all about this product.

B0C2PNWDGZ,5,Cleaning ability,I love how this picks up dog hair and dirt. It runs quietly and is really easy to empty the dirt compartment and clean the filter.

B0C2PNWDGZ,5,Met or exceeded expectations,Expected to work as described and it did. In fact it exceeded my expectations.

B0C2PNWDGZ,5,Works great so far,"Easy setup, no complaints after about a month of solid, multiple time a day use, and constant abuse by our two toddlers. Quieter than our last one and I like that it’s got the sucking power instead of a rolling brush, I feel like that works better and isn’t constantly getting clogged with hair. Quick shipping, and incredibly reasonably priced as it was also on sale when I bought it. Hopefully it lasts a while because we like it so far.","Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2024"
B0C2PNWDGZ,5,Great Price and works great.,"At first, I didn't think I was going to be able to put it together, but there were very directions with it and I got it together quickly.

B0C2PNWDGZ,5,bought for the bedrooms,"I use the 4000 pa vac with the mopping for my hardwood floors and the kitchen. I definitely use it more than I ever vacuumed the normal way. So I decided to buy the same brand, but without mopping feature for the bedrooms. And I already love it. It works well for carpet as well as for the vinyl part. It's just so easy to switch it on and so satisfying to empty the vacuum and see all the dirt collected. I am happy with it.","Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2024"

My family all likes this little guy, and it's made cleaning up more fun -- I can even get the kids excited to pick up their things if they know the robot is coming out!","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

B0C2PNWDGZ,5,Simple and easy to use,"When I was searching for a mid-grade robo-vacuum for our basement, I was ""floored"" by how many are on Amazon. Many are the same one, but re-branded with some other random app and name. I landed on this one, not because of the name (which is hard enough to even say), but because it didn't look like a typical knock-off. I already have a high-end vacuum for our main floor (w/ a self-empty unit), so I know how these things operate. The app for this one is very simple to use. I was able to easily detect the vacuum and add it to the app. No issues there, I didn't even need to use the directions. In terms of how it works, there are no rollers, it is just a sucking vacuum. Good or bad you decide, but for my basement, this is what we needed. We have mostly finished space, but with hard floor, not much carpet. So no need for a roller for us. I've found it sucks up dust, dog hair (lots of it), and minor debris quite easily. It finds it base when its done and recharges. I have it running every 2 days and I empty it once a week. If I don't empty it and it fills up, sometimes it will drop a clump of dog hair, but that's my fault, I just need to remember to empty it. All in all, for this price point, I would recommend it. Again, it depends on your space and what features you are looking for. But if you need something simple and reliable, and quite inexpensive. This one is worth a go.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2023"
B0C2PNWDGZ,5,"Great vacuum, great app, great performance!","This vacuum has exceeded all expectations. You can’t beat the price point. I basically hired a year round cleaner for $110. I really like that there is no roller brush. It doesn’t have a problem with picking everything up. The suction on it is great and as you can see in the picture I posted, it is efficient. The picture was once cleaning cycle on hardwood floors. I have owned other brands of robot vacuums and the roller brush always needs to be taken apart and cleaner after 2-3 uses. It has also caused malfunctions due to the motor getting worn out which made those other vacuums inoperable. I don’t have to worry about that with this one. The collection tray is very convenient and easy to empty. The vacuum can maneuver really well and is quiet. The app that pairs to the vacuum is great. It really compliments it well. You can select different modes, see how long it has been cleaning, and see what percentage of the battery is left or status of charge. The app lets you activate the vacuum from anywhere or set a cleaning schedule. When I’m away from the house I can open the app and select a mode and when I get home the floors are clean! Using the app is a must!! Overall, you can’t beat the performance or price point of this robot vacuum. It performs the same as the other high end vacuums for a fraction of the cost. You could buy 3 for the price of one and now you have a fleet cleaning your house rather than just one. I am strongly considering ordering another one.","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2023"

It’s so convenient to have the floors cleaned while I’m doing laundry or watching TV and it saves me so much time. It’s not perfect, it will not get around the walls perfectly, but it does an excellent job going from wood to rug to carpet. I was shocked and disgusted by the amount of dirt it picked up the first time. It’s definitely worth the money to me. It’s not too loud, I sometimes fall asleep while it is going the cleaning. It will periodically bump into furniture and gets under my dining room table with all the chairs and somehow makes it out. I’d definitely recommend getting one or two because this is my second one.","Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2023"

I love the convenience of these vacuums that take over one of my chores for me! My absolute favorite feature of this model is that it only beeps twice when it gets stuck somewhere. Other models I have had beep up to 20 times which is just unnecessary and wakes my sleeping babies when I run it at nap time. This model doesn’t do that. Just two small beeps then it’s done.

And let's not even get into the amount of sand he brings in from running, playing and digging in the backyard! My husband bought a commercial sweeper to try and keep our floors clean, but it was a twice a day sweep and still we felt like we weren't touching the problem. My MIL bought us the Ropvanic Robot Vacuum as an early Christmas gift. I cannot believe the incredible change I have seen with just a 3 times a day vacuuming of the house. I don't see glitter anymore. I can walk barefoot in my own home and not feel like I've been at the beach. My husband is floored and just so excited to not have to sweep constantly anymore. I programmed the unit (very easily) to sweep 3 times a day. It's actually pretty quiet. I was worried, as I work on the phones from home. I can easily work without any issues and I can even watch tv without turning it up higher. It's not even a quarter loud as my regular vacuum. I will never live without a robot vacuum again!

It’s not loud like our old one either. Emptying the compartment is very easy to do as well and you don’t have to pick the whole thing up to do it. You just open the top and pull the bin out.

Not only has it been highly responsive, but the app integration has been seamless, allowing for easy scheduling and monitoring. The vacuum consistently delivers a thorough clean across my floors, picking up dust, hair, and crumbs without missing any spots. What I like about it is it’s smart navigation and ability to return to its dock without any issues. I’ve used other robot vacuums in the past that struggled to find their way back to charge, often getting stuck or needing to be manually adjusted. With this I don’t have to worry about that; it reliably completes its job and returns to the charging station","Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2024"

B0C2PNWDGZ,4,Great for small jobs,"Light weight, quiet, good for small jobs and pet hair. Doesn’t perform well on carpet. Great for tile and wood floors. Noise level is minimal/ very quiet. The remote works well, I haven’t used the app. Setup was easy and took about 5 minutes. I haven’t found a way to map it just yet so it does seem to get hung up around furniture but it gives a very tiny bump so I’m not concerned about damage. Navigates best in wide open spaces. It also is able to transition from carpet to hard wood to tile very well. No issues getting hung up at thresholds. The sweeping inserts seem a bit cheap and won’t hold up more than a year. They did provide two extras but they are bent. Hopefully the seller has an option to buy more. Overrall good value at $45 (Amazon deal). In hindsight if I had paid more than $60 I wouldn’t be very happy.

B0C2PNWDGZ,2,Gets stuck,"Pro: It vacuums... Okay so I wanted to like this. But I don't. Battery life is not so great. I've had it for a week and I've been observing it clean. This thing goes everywhere in the most erratic pattern ever. It doesn't even make sense. The sensor works sometimes. And it can never return to base. It'll die trying to find the base, never makes it. It'll mostly crash into everything. It does vacuum tho. It collects a good amount of dust and dirt. The hairs get tangled up in the rotating bristles. So eventually you have to manually remove those. I only use it in the living room and it won't finish cleaning the living room before the battery dies. The biggest issue I have is it gets stuck under the tables and the couches. It'll clean maybe 20% of the living area before I notice it's been stuck under the recliner or couch. When I pull it out it's dead from trying to get out. It's like a having a crawling baby that is drunk and I have to keep an eye on and ain't nobody got time for that.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2024"

I then get to go on an adventure, searching for the vacuum. ""where is the vacuum? oh, middle of the living room floor, dead."" it gets one star because it does pick up a good amount of dirt... but it also just completely misses rooms within the house. why? cause its circling the dining room table 7 times then dying somewhere in a hallway.","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2024"

It does a good job at trapping dirt and seems to do well on low carpet. It’s pretty quiet. Has gotten stuck on a few things so watch out for loose power cords etc. I would say the biggest downside is that we do have to clean the propellers frequently from my long hair, not sure if that would be the same with all vacuums.

This robot vacuum is an impressive value that I’ve found... This helps frees your time and is NOT loaded with a lot of bells and whistles that don’t provide a lot of value. It vacuums great and is such a time saver. Packaging: packaging is great and has all the necessary items and extra brushes to help provide value. It will likely do 2 maybe 3 cleaning before you need to empty the dust bin but mind you, the more you empty it the better the suction. At this point it’s practically set it and forget it. I’m loving it!!! Installation: it’s practically Plug-and-Play Simplicity Unbox it and plug it in, let it charge fully and then you can letter suck!!! Pun intended haha.

My husband bought a commercial sweeper to try and keep our floors clean, but it was a twice a day sweep and still we felt like we weren't touching the problem. My MIL bought us the Ropvanic Robot Vacuum as an early Christmas gift. I cannot believe the incredible change I have seen with just a 3 times a day vacuuming of the house. I don't see glitter anymore. I can walk barefoot in my own home and not feel like I've been at the beach. My husband is floored and just so excited to not have to sweep constantly anymore. I programmed the unit (very easily) to sweep 3 times a day. It's actually pretty quiet. I was worried, as I work on the phones from home. I can easily work without any issues and I can even watch tv without turning it up higher. It's not even a quarter loud as my regular vacuum. I will never live without a robot vacuum again!

B0C2PNWDGZ,5,Works great so far,"Easy setup, no complaints after about a month of solid, multiple time a day use, and constant abuse by our two toddlers. Quieter than our last one and I like that it’s got the sucking power instead of a rolling brush, I feel like that works better and isn’t constantly getting clogged with hair. Quick shipping, and incredibly reasonably priced as it was also on sale when I bought it. Hopefully it lasts a while because we like it so far.","Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2024"

B0C2PNWDGZ,5,This thing ping pongs around the room...,After it ping pongs around long enough it can clean a bedroom. But how long does it take for a random pattern to cover everything? Aha! It seems to be going around the edges of multiple rooms now. My Husky doesn't know what to make of it... It does appear to have some smarts. It is going from room to room but by chance I believe. It did find its way back to the charger. Amazing. And it self charged. And the dust/hair receptacle had stuff in it that I emptied. 2nd day worked OK but got stuck under side table & sofa. Had to rescue it. Seems like a good buy.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2024"

The suction power is strong, and it does a fantastic job picking up dust, pet hair, and crumbs from my hard floors and carpets. The multiple cleaning modes are convenient, and the app control makes scheduling easy. However, I do wish it had a mapping feature to make cleaning more efficient and thorough. Despite that, it’s still a great, budget-friendly option that delivers good value for the price.","Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2024"

Some of my very thin pile carpets has trouble going over and it sometimes gets lost in the room.

Not only has it been highly responsive, but the app integration has been seamless, allowing for easy scheduling and monitoring. The vacuum consistently delivers a thorough clean across my floors, picking up dust, hair, and crumbs without missing any spots. What I like about it is it’s smart navigation and ability to return to its dock without any issues.

Fall detection helps in the upper levels so that it won’t fall off the stairs. The suction power is decent and it does its job nicely. Charge option on both remote and mobile app is a nice add on as it will return back to the charging station where in the same floor. There are four modes of cleaning auto / border / spot / manual. Just make sure to secure smaller objects as it might get vacuumed thinking it as dirt. The object collision sensor is great too. Overall great product for great price.

B0C2PNWDGZ,5,Perfect for Busy Homes!,"I've been using the ROPVACNIC Robot Vacuum Cleaner for a few days, and it has quickly become a favorite cleaning tool in my household. Here’s what I found: Suction Power: The 3000Pa cyclone suction power is genuinely impressive. It picks up everything from pet hair to small debris, and it doesn’t struggle with crumbs or dirt on hard floors or low-pile carpets. It even handles the edges and corners pretty well. Control Options: I love the flexibility with control options! You can manage it via the mobile app, voice commands (Alexa-compatible), or the included remote. The app is easy to use, with simple controls for scheduling, choosing cleaning modes, and viewing cleaning history. Self-Charging & Scheduling: The self-charging feature works flawlessly. When the battery is low, the vacuum automatically returns to its charging base, which saves a lot of hassle. Scheduling cleanings is straightforward through the app, which is excellent for staying on top of dust and pet hair. Pet-Friendly: With two cats and a dog, I was particularly concerned about how well this would handle pet hair. It’s been great so far! It doesn’t clog up, and the brushes are easy to clean, even when they get hair wrapped around them. Performance on Flooring: This vacuum shines on hard floors, and it handles low carpets well. It’s probably not ideal for thicker carpets, but if you have mostly hardwood or tile with a few low-pile rugs, it’s a great fit. What Could Be Better: It can get a little loud on maximum suction, though this is to be expected with higher-powered vacuums. The dustbin also fills up quickly if you have pets, so plan to empty it regularly. Overall: For the price, especially on this limited-time deal, the ROPVACNIC Robot Vacuum Cleaner offers fantastic value. It’s a reliable and versatile vacuum that tackles everyday messes well and integrates seamlessly into a busy household.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

B0D73KRP4M,5,"Great all-around device, good features, nice app, decent features, but full price might be steep","I got this brand new during the Amazon Prime sale for only $100. For that price, it's easily 6-stars. Set up was extremely easy and quick. I habitually sweep and spot-vacuum the apartment whenever I feel a crumb underfoot — the first time I ran this vacuum, it sucked up a fluffy ""brick"" of lint and debris that I somehow missed in the various crevices or underneath furniture. I couldn't believe it. Registration for the app was easy (feel free to use a secondary email address for privacy). The app itself is pretty smooth, intuitive and feature-packed. The only thing I wish it did was save a record of the map that was created during a vacuum session. As far as I can see, it deletes itself each time the device ends its cleaning period. Now, at full price (~$250), I don't know if I would rate it at the imaginary 6-stars I mentioned above — perhaps 4 or 4.5 stars. It feels like a lot of money for lesser-known brand, and for barebones unit that doesn't mop or self-empty. I wouldn't go lower than 4-stars though, because it seems to clean very well, comes with replacement parts (filter and sweeps), and has a nice app. The battery life suggests 120 minutes but it seems to be more like 90, and that is on ""Standard"" settings. Via the app, it has scheduling, manual remote control, quiet mode, standard mode, high performance mode, full area (formulaic), full area (random), spot cleaning, etc. Updates can also be pushed through the app. It's a great all-around device.

That is on low pile carpet mostly. I feel like if it only had hardwood or tile floors to run on, I'd probably get closer to the 120 minutes per charge. But it really does a fantastic job.

B08R9LK9K3,5,I'm surprised.,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much but I'm very surprised. A deal breaker for me was not needing to connect to WiFi. I posted a question and received different responses, there was no user manual on their website or Amazon. Thankfully, you do not need WiFi to operate this. Hopefully yours is the same but I just put it in the corner of the room with the charger, hit the power button and away it went! It's unbelievably smart, it knows how to get every single corner and crevice. It seems like it actually goes back to certain areas because it was unsure. I think if you push the power button in different ways it will change the operating settings but I'm not sure and again, no specific info regarding that on the documentation. I do know if you push the power button twice it will activate ""return"" mode and will go back to the charger. It also will automatically go back to the charger if the battery is low. I'm amazed. I run it every couple days and it gets 20% full every time. Hopefully if I keep up with the maintenance it will last awhile. It is one of the cheaper robot vacuums on the market so I think that's the caveat, it doesn't last very long.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

Hard linoleum floors, and multiple rugs (the thin kind you can toss in the washing machine). The cat sheds a lot and makes a mess with the litter of course. I was vacuuming 1 time per week bc that is what my schedule allows for, but by the end of the week the furr ball dust bunnies and the litter tracked all over the house was just awful. I turn on the robot every day or every other day and it keeps my floors feeling clean to walk on! Sometimes it will miss a closet or miss one of the bed rooms when cleaning before it runs out of battery. I keep it in my bed room to ensure it always cleans my room.

He puts himself back on the loading dock and he does a super great job on hardwood floors. My mom was sweeping every day (Because let's be honest, they wear their outside shoes in the house) and this has been a life saver for them. One less chore to do after work, more time to relax together! Great product, highly recommend!","Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,5,It works even on dog hair,This is a fairly simple vacuum that I don't have to struggle with tech instructions to use. Works good even on dog hair. I have 2 big dogs that shed constantly so I clean it out every 20 minutes or so but for normal dirt you would not need to. Low profile so goes under furniture without getting stuck.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,5,Always amazed,"I’ve had this now for a couple of months waiting on consistency of use before writing a review. I have been very pleased with this. I like that it can go up on rugs in my kitchen and my living room without getting stuck. We used to have a really cheap vacuum that couldn’t do that and it was so annoying. I like that it seems to sense when it’s got wrapped up in cables and will just beep at me and stop rotating. The only thing is, I’ve seen people talk about the feature where it can go back to its own charging port, and I have not been able to succeed at that. I am always amazed at how much it manages to pick up. I think my house is a very clean space, but this proves me wrong that little things are always brought into the carpets, etc..","Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,5,Great for my small space,"All in all, I have been wanting to get a robot vacuum for a long time to just handle a chore that I frequently don't have the spoons or time for. During Prime week I had concerns that this one was as discounted as it was but figured I can always return it - so decided to get it. I have the largest bedroom in the town home, I close my closet and bathroom door and move an object to sit Infront of my dresser, so it won't go under it (as my cat5 cable threads through that space). I push the button and leave and go to work. I come home and find it returned to its base and I dump its container. When I first got it, it successfully vacuumed a considerable amount of dog hair that I didn't even realize was on the floor. My room consumes a full charge as the fan is set to high, so I tend to run it multiple times in a week to ensure that it has gotten everywhere. because the sweeper arms once bent are pretty much in that shape for forever, i doubt its ""deep cleaning"" over a full size/power vacuum, but it does a really good job and simple enough to just run it a few times in a week. Suction Power, I didn't feel was at 5 stars and admit it might be because of my carpet type. I just felt that it wasn't doing much unless the fan was set to High. But, Ive kept it on High, and let it do its thing without issue; i just dont think that low or medium are very impactful for me. The included batteries for the remote are next to useless but that is to be expected for included batteries. The remote isn't really intuitive and the instruction book is only kinda useful. I found it easier to simply ignore it and push the button. I downloaded the app, as well as integrated with Alexa - but after a few attempts... it was still easier to just go and push the button. All in all, I don't have any other robot vacuum to compare it to, but I definitely like this one and like the effort it puts in and saves me from doing. I may eventually save money for a more name brand model with bells and whistles - but this one works for me and has been working like a charm since I got it. Though I have been attempting to figure out where/how to get more of the sweeping arm things...","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2022"

B08R9LK9K3,5,Better than the Roomba for several reasons,"I was gifted a Roomba robot and liked it better than I thought I would so I bought this Lefant for my second house so I have been able to compare. When the Roomba went down after several years I replaced it with another Lefant so I have bought two of them. The Lefant is better because: It goes over floor vents much better- it is not ""dramatic"" and stops when it barely goes over a floor vent like the other brand did. Lefant will back itself up when it can. Same with sucking up a cord- Lefant will spit it out and keep going. It will chug over stuff as opposed to the other brand which would stop at every little thing. Lefant battery lasts a long time it will do a whole floor of my house on one charge. Note: be sure to empty the canister often after each run and twice if you have dog hair. The battery will last longer- it uses more power to suck air through a wad of dirt. Lefant is much quieter- the other brand will ram into things hard like furniture but Lefant is much gentler on my baseboards and doesn't sound like someone bowling upstairs when it runs. Lefant does not have a talking feature like other brand. The other brand would sit for hours then in the middle of the night yell at me ""Charge Now!"" I prefer the less dramatic Lefant for this reason. I have had the first Lefant in a house with dog hair for over two years and the second one for three months.","Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,5,Perfect,"First off let me say that I'm peed off that Amazon let someone deliver this package at 11 at night although it was in scheduled for in the morning, I was worried someone might see it and take it since I wouldn't be home. Next day update the mapping is useless it only tells me what area has been cleaned I originally thought once mapped I could then choose what areas to select for cleaning I opened the box popped the bushes on set up WiFi. It says it will only work on 2.4 but I have a dual router and it works fine. While cleaning it will map where it's cleaned. I even used the manual mode and it works great so far. Just a heads up before startup place your charger and vacuum in the spot you want it to be in otherwise the mapping will not coordinate properly. If you were excited as me as me and just turned it on you did what I did. Upon unboxing the the charge was about 20 percent. It cleaned for a few minutes and then tried finding the charger but couldn't. I set the charger up and placed it on the charger let it charge to 30 and ran a clean again this time it was able to find once it ran to about 15%. I did unpair it and then paired it again which I didn't even have to use the power button and ran another clean. The map updated and shows a more accurate cleaning picture. For less than a hundred bucks I cannot be mad that the mapping system doesn't so far seem to allow you to pick what area you want to clean or focus on.

I ended up buying this and I’m so glad I did. It works really well, the battery lasts a couple of hours, and it’s pretty good at getting itself unstuck from random objects. I will say, it can sometimes miss patches of my kitchen before leaving it and it can’t pick up bigger pieces. I think there might be a manual navigation option in the app but I haven’t tried it so maybe that’s a user error on my part. But overall it’s a great machine.

B08R9LK9K3,5,So quiet,"Recently we have had an issue running our normal robot vac (basic roomba). Its too loud. It scares my daughter (2 yrs), my dog (115 pds) is scared too. Its so loud we have to turn the tv way up and can't run it at night. It doesn't seem to sense stuff well during the day or night and bangs into things loudly. In comes Lefant. I was searching for a few days and it took me a while to find this one just because it was originally listed out of my search budget. I wanted scheduling ability and NOT a random pattern. I had also hoped for something with a barrier system but alas not in my budget or not associated with anything labeled QUIET. I found this on sale for around $94. We have had this a day and so far I really like it. Its quiet, no need to raise the volume on the TV, I ran it last night and no one heard it. My dog isnt' scared and my daughter isn't crying or screaming when we tested it. We have mostly hard floors (laminate and tile) and some rugs. It seems to have decent suction and its still set on medium, you can adjust that via the app. I like there is NO brush roll, I was constantly having to clean out the brush roll on the Roomba, which sometimes couldn't be done easily so I invested in spare parts so I could just clean at my leisure. It does seem to have to try a little more to get on the rugs but I think I might try to double side tape them down where its having the issue and update later. I did buy the warranty on this as review are mixed. I did find spare parts but they aren't sold by Lefant. https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09JSZJNG1?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_X0ZDS4PZN4SXC1QMDN4A there is the link to what I found and it appears it will fit. Pairing with Alexa is possible. Download the skill Smart Life in alexa's mobile app. Then hold the silver button down on the top for a few seconds until it fast blinks blue. Go through the new pairing process with the Lefant APP , then switch to alexa and try to discover a new device. From there it should find it and I was able to put it on a schedule. I used a video I found via a google search that is an Amazon video on another Lefant vacuum to get it paired and set up.","Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2022"
B08R9LK9K3,5,Cleans everywhere extremely well!,"I loved the price of this robot vacuum I named Max. I often use the powerful option in the app that about doubles the suction. I have two cats and still amazed at the amount of cat hair and litter, dust and cat food it picks up. I have it setup to vacuum my house every day at 3pm. I get a notification at 3pm each day that Max has successfully started to vacuum. It also shows the map in the app where Max has vacuumed. He also learns where items are and goes right up to them and around. Great job getting everything that might be against the moulding and 1/4 round.Besidea the house looking very clean, you can see what it collects in the bin. I empty it everyday when I get home. Max vacuums for about 1hr and 20 min on each charge. Automatically goes back to charging base after each session. I have purchased other older much more expensive robot vacuums.

B08R9LK9K3,5,This is a great starter robotic vacuum!,"Actually purchased this for a friend that can’t get his expensive roomba running. He gave up, so wanted to see how these things work then say here you go. Well, nope, this litter “sucker” is staying here. I am so challenged when it comes to operating these things but it was so easy to set up. Then sat down with the separate remote we purchased to get this thing moving. Set it off the charger & it came to life sounding like R2D2. Had not read how to program a room yet but this vacuum just took off & mapped the room automatically, huh? Wow! It just buzzed around going where it could, not hitting anything since the sensors read everything it gets close to, then it just does these cute turns till it gets around it. Plus it’s amazing how well it tightly hugs around a table leg, could leg that is high enough plus vacuums pretty well. That is the only thing I will slight it for but for this amazing price, so far it works better than our friends $800 roomba at under $100. Did not want that needed Alexa or did mopping, just basic vacuuming. This one is awesome. We laughed so hard when it finished then we pressed the button on the remote to send it home to the docking station. It powers down to a slow speed, spins around to find the docking station then it looks so sad in the way it goes back to its home like a scolded child. So we let it do one more room like it’s human or a good dog. So now it’s a member of the family. Good grief!

B08R9LK9K3,5,Great vacuum!,"Full disclosure: this is my first experience with a robot vacuum. Liked: Effective with debris (dust, dirt, lint, pet & human hair, bits of paper) Battery powers 2 hour runtime Disliked: Big Wheel (kids tricycle) hard plastic tires on wood floor=noise, didn't often find its way home to charge, body builds static=dust clings to it. Fun to watch algorithms at work and this thing can climb over 1""x2” lumber intended as a barrier. Wish: No-go zones or magnetic barrier sensors. I initially rated it five star. Then it broke after 13 days. Contacted support by phone, and they walked me thru a basic reset procedure. Not successful. Then we exchanged emails a few times. Still no luck. I like this machine. In this price range, I don't think you will find better. I recommend this machine for hard floors (no carpet available to comment on). In just the few days that it's been down, I see what a great job it was doing! I'm getting a new one. Same model from the same merchant. I'm betting that the broken one is a fluke. I am getting the extended warranty this time because I want to still be using it in three years—it's that good. Update: Lefant service folks seriously tried to fix the problem. When they couldn't, they sent a new machine. In the meantime, I bought a second unit. Now I'm blessed with two great machines that I heartily recommend! The 2nd machine is in a different area. One with some rugs. Hey, look at that nice clean carpet! Should you ever need support from Lefant I believe you will be completely satisfied with the outcome.

B08R9LK9K3,5,This vacuum is for hardwood or tile floors - However it is very good at not hanging up on rugs,"Look at the picture of the bottom of this robot vacuum. It is a small 2.5 by .5 inch slot with a rubber dam and turning brushes directing debris into the slot. Yet it does work pretty well, even on rugs. Surprisingly well and no brush to tangle up. Clearly intended for pet hair and small debris on a tile or hardware floor. Con: Usual confusing instructions for setup - beeps wrongly described. App is OK and seems reliable. Pros: Small and simple to use, and cheap. Battery life long enough that I got bored and picked up to put on charger after testing it in a large floor space with half tile and half rcarpet. And small throw rugs and even a couple of power cords; and chairs and couches and plants and cat toys... IT DID NOT HANG UP EVEN ONCE! Oh there was also a stair it could fall down but it didn't. Only robot vacuum I have ever had that did not hang up on that floor. Five Stars! I plan to use it on in an office room with mostly tile and a couple of area rugs. It will be perfect for that.","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,5,Best on Market for the price.,"The manual that comes with unit is quite poor. Programming the robot to operate as scheduled is very difficult. You are encouraged to download the app, but it not explained what it is gained by using the app. A mopping accessory is referenced, but there is no information on it. The unit may be uniquely assigned to a room, but configuring the unit to the room is not explained. Pretty powerful vacuum for the price, but I paid $95. At the increased price, I’m not so sure. If the price drops I’ll buy again and forego the implied automation and just run it more often to make up for the less powerful vacuum motor. The positives are it returns for auto charging very dependably and negotiates cleaning areas very well. Update: Very happy with the unit. I program it to run everyday. The collection bin filled up the first day, but then less and less as it cleaned the floors everyday. Since I don’t have to vacuum, I don’t care how often it runs. It’s very unobtrusive. I barricaded off a huge living room dining area, and then after I was satisfied it could do a good job, not get stuck and get back to the charging station, I added more areas. First a long hall. Then one bedroom. Then the other bedroom, and then both bedrooms. It vacuumed great, and always made it back to the charging station. I would suggest doing it similarly to learn how it works in your house and how you might have to remedy a few places where it might bet stuck, which were many, maybe one or two. I ordered another for another part of the house, to keep the demands on function well minimal. This I believe will prove better than a very expensive machine that promises to do everything in the whole house. I will get the mopping accessories if they bring them to market. I thought that I would use my powerful and expensive upright occasionally to get the floors really clean. I used it once. Forget that. Never again. Too heavy, too time consuming and too much work. I have better things to do.","Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2022"

B08R9LK9K3,5,I hardly ever give 5 stars,"I am more than impressed with this little vacuum. To start, I own a Rainbow air cleaner and vacuum system. However, it’s a pretty good size piece of equipment to tote around for as much as I need to clean floors. Which means I don’t let to get it run as an air cleaner. For this robot vacuum, I plan to use it daily to keep the dog hair and other dog debris off the floor on a daily. For anyone who has dogs, we know how much dirt gets tracked in and out. We named the little vacuum slick. It paired after a second attempt. No other issues. I ran it and let it clean the whole house. I did my due diligence and moved cords. Picked up all the toy stuffs and it did the whole downstairs of our townhome. I had to empty it once and pick t he hair out of the little vent but I have a lot of dog hair. It holds more than you think. I scheduled it to clean this morning before I woke up, and it ran for 1.5 hours on quiet and standard mode and still had a 40% charge. I have looked at robot vacuums for a while. This is my first one and I’m more than happy with it so far. Now slick runs daily, sometimes twice and my rainbow makes the house smell good with essential oils. :) ***UPDATE 8/13 The little thing started squeeking like crazy. I did all the maintenance it says to do and it seemed to help a tad but then started squeeking again. At first I didn’t mind it, I knew he was running if it was giving off a little squeak now and then but then it just kept getting louder. Found out it’s the FRONT wheel that squeaks when it gets dirty. A little tiny bit of WD40 fixed it right up. Apply to front wheel, spin and wipe excess with paper towel.

I have 2 dogs (1 is a lab/shepherd mix) and 2 cats - 1 long hair and 1 short hair. Chasing fur and hair daily on my red bamboo wood floors was exhausting! I was prepared to hv to pay $250-290. But I came looking here and saw this one and all the reviews. I ordered in the AM and it arrived by 3pm. I got lucky on a Daily Deal for $88. I wasted no time grabbing it. I charged it - not long at all- and set it to go. It did my downstairs in less than an hour which is the kitchen/dining/family rm/formal rm. this thing did great! I took it to the upstairs the next day and again it did not disappoint. Ill be back for another so there is one for each floor. Then I will use the app to set schedules. A great buy. A great machine! Oh and it is really quiet and follows a learning pattern in your home. 7/15 followup: the app did not work for me and says you need a version of the wifi that I thought I had. Read the fine print there. I am unable to schedule my robovac to run like I hoped. Also after a few runs upstairs I find it less effective. Not sure why but it doesn't suction or capture small catsand. Sorta defeats one reason for having it. Still good but I have some reservations after a few uses now.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,5,For the price is great!,"Honestly it is pauses quite often and but clean very well the first 80% of its battery life. Then it cleans but not with strength and may leave drops towards the end. Do not wait to clean the inside, do it after each cleaning as possible. It goes back to dock when charging needed, do not touch it, it will. It is white noise, does not bother me. It took its time to do Mapping. But oh well. It is a good size and easy to manage. The app is super easy to manage. You seriously have to be connected to 2g on your WiFi. It is not complicated. Put password and be close to it so the can connect. Then all you do is press clean, the rest is history. The color I adore!! Again, for the price, I feel I got a big deal. Trust me, this is a really good deal.","Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,5,2 Huskies and 3 cats! Love it!,"I have 2 pomskies and 3 cats! Lots of hair in my house! This thing works great for cutting my floor cleaning chores dwn dramatically! Now if you are looking for perfection you will be disappointed, but now I can tend to my floors once a week instead of daily, it will pick up a peace of dog food n drop it else were but saves me so much time, I empty it once a day and clean the wheels maybe once a week. My one complain is it will get stuck in a spot and then obsess over it! It keeps going back and trying again and again but there are worse things in life then saving a vacuum from getting stuck again, I could be sweeping all my floors twice a day 🤣 over all I love this thing, saves me so much time and I have 2 Huskies in the house so I deffently put it to the test and I am pleased! Oh and by the way I have all hard floors and no carpet, I honestly dont think it would be the best for carpets as it dont have the brushes under it but that's what I was looking for cause with all the hair in my home it would be a tangled mess so for my hard floors and massive amounts of hair this thing works amazing! I highly recommend it for pet owners with hard floors! Now here is the struggle my daughter had with this, she only has 5G wifi and it will not connect unless you have 2.4G. I have 2.4G and everything worked great, my daughter needs to buy a new router so she can get the 2.4G so it will connect. 🤷‍♀️ so this is my good bad and ugly review of this thing. So in the end, hairy animals, hard floors, great affordable vacuum for the money.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2022"
B08R9LK9K3,5,Makes a lazy person even lazier LMAO with edit,"Seriously though I was hesitant on buying a robot vacuum because I’ve heard so many early on negatives but as things have progressed, I have seen the quality this is unbelievable. I recommend this completely. I think that if you have dogs or cats in your house that shed you can turn this on and it will go through and pick up all the dog or cat hair or at least 90% of it. Obviously, you’re gonna have to move furniture or use an actual vacuum or both to get the entire job done but the robot vacuum does 95% of it Five stars is not enough. OK, here’s the edit; it says 120 minute run time most of the time I have it on carpet boost and powerful mode and I get right at 80 minutes every time I use it and it’s really wonderful to keep up on pet hair, etc. but I still use my corded vacuum a couple times a month","Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2024"

It is picking up a surprising amount of debris. It is rather loud and noisy, so I certainly couldn’t have it going while on calls, But outside of that, I am impressed with its operation. When it senses an object, it backs up and when it encounters and area rug, it lifts up slightly and goes over it. It’s been going under my furniture and getting all the dust bunnies and dog hair. For the price point, you can’t beat this. Note: I have only use this on hardwood and an area rug, I have not tested it on carpet or stairs","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,5,I love this lil guy!,"If you're contemplating whether you should or shouldn't buy this vacuum, DO IT! My lil vac is named Joey (the app will ask you to name it) . Haha I am so surprised pleased with Joey and I was shocked at well this works for the price. I have 3 of my own dogs and am always pup sitting at least one and I was CONSTANTLY vacuuming throughoutthe day, at least 3 times a day. Now, I set the schedule for him to automatically vacuum and I don't have to worry about it. I have it scheduled to vacuum twice a day and if I feel my floors need vacuumed more, I can manually set it to clean. It holds a good amount of dirt and hair and it does a great job. It usually, maneuvers well over my rugs and transitions pretty well from my LVP over the rugs and into my bathroom on the shaggy rugs. The normal setting is actually quite quiet but quiet mode is very quiet anf doesn't wake me if it's vacuuming while I'm still asleep. The suction power is quite strong and usually get everything it goes over. $80 well spent!","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2024"

We have LVP throughout the house and a few rugs and this vacuum easily navigates our entire home and doesn’t mess up the rugs. Sometimes, if the container is full (it often is), there will be clumps of dog fur around the house but other than that this thing gets the job done! It’s not too noisy and has three different modes for suction, and it learns the layout of rooms pretty quick, too. I would suggest getting plastic guards to go under tables, couches, etc. because it will get stuck in really tight spaces. The app is easy to use and the vacuum finds its charger all on its own once the battery is low. I can’t recommend this thing enough!!","Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2024"

I was a bit concerned about it working around steps but it did very well and didn't fall but scared me a couple times. The scheduled days are awesome and it's on que.

At first it was picking up a ton! We have a big dog. Now that it’s really cleaned up everywhere. Even under my couches because it is so slim, I empty the cup every evening (typically full of dog hair). It’s amazing that I can walk around everyday and not have dog hair cover my foot. Previously I would have had to vacuum daily. It’s amazing! The cup and filter are easy to clean and it is not terribly noisy. Note, I have learned to keep carpeted room doors closed and only use this on hard wood floors. I was previously scared to purchase a high dollar robot vacuum for fear the dog hair would mess it up.

B08R9LK9K3,5,Vacuums so I don't have to,"I'm very happy with this vacuum. It runs for about 2 hours. Picks up alot of dust and hair. Does a good job with obstacles it will either stop or figure out its stuck and slow down and redirect. It can get tangled on cords. This doesn't have a roller. I had an old vacuum with a roller, the roller had to be cleaned. Both do a good job cleaning , so im not sure that i have a preference. My old robot vacuum wasn't as high so it did a better job going under furniture, so that's a bit disappointing but my fault for not checking the measurements.

B08R9LK9K3,5,It is the dumbest robot,"Update: customer service ended up reaching out to me about my rumba. They contacted in a very timely way, and got to fix the problem asap. For 5 stars for that! This robot is extremely dumb. Mine will try to climb everything in sight and takes forever to find its home. Sometimes it dies before it even fines it, and i can set the home near it and watch the robot move away. Gets stuck on every single little thing. It tries to eat the cat food bowl, wires, tries to go outside even if there is a border there. I can't tell you the amount of times this thing has gotten stuck by trying to under the fridge. You would think if it hits something that it would turn around and go a different way but mine keeps trying till it loses. Yet, if my curtains are touching the floor, the rumba will avoid them at all costs. The only plus side of this rumba does do a good job of cleaning floor as long as you pick up everything big. I do run it every week and have had it for a few months. It was on a deal of the day and if you don't mind picking everything up then it works very well. It will miss spots as mine likes to stay in one area till the fighting match it has with something is over and it gives up. I do like the app, as you can move it while it is cleaning to avoid areas, you can set a schedule, move along the walls, sprail, or bow, but only through the app. Also you can change the suction from low, medium to high settings. Overall, it is not a smart robot but it does get the job done.","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2023"

It gets stuck a lot and has gotten tangled I'm my curtians and a blanket my kid left on the floor. After a few days it started making a really annoying squeezing sound I only run it when I'm not home so it doesn't really bother me but annoys the crap out of my kid which is ok now he knows how it feels to have something make screeching noises and won't listen to you when you tell it to shut up. update: I have received incredible customer support which told me how to fix the noise issue I was having. It worked and the robot works flawlessly. I did not respond to the manufacture and they continued to follow up to make sure I was happy with the product and the solution they provided. It has been many years since I have delt with a company so concerned with the quality of their product and I am very impressed. With the cost of this robot the quality and the customer service I will buy from this company again and again. And just to clear things up the issue I was having with the noise was not an issue with the product itself it was caused by my son running the robot over stuff he didn't feel like picking up and it got stuck around the wheels.

B08R9LK9K3,5,Decent product with very good customer service,"This review is after 6 months of product usage I was new to the robovac world and the lefant M210 model looked like a good starter product. Ordered one in october 2022 and it has been chugging along just fine. The robovac is small compared to other products and its weight is on the lighter side as well, so thick carpet edges can be a hurdle but if you can confine it right or if you have hardwood floors it will work like a champ. I do wish it came with a physical remote, needs to be purchased separately :( After about 6 months of usage the battery went kaput. The robovac would beep 6 times with red light flashing and would do this thrice and would just simply sit on the charging base. The manual said this pattern of error meant the device switch was not swicthed on but i had confirmed that it was. Was disappointed with the short life span and decided to reach out to customer service to, at the very least, complain. The excellent customer service more than made up for my troubles. They first sent me a new battery with instructions on replacing it. This helped and brought the robovac back to life but for some reason the run time on a single charge went down from 100 mins to about 45 mins which meant i had to charge it twice for a single cleanup. I sent this data over to customer service and within a few days they sent over a new robovac solving all my issues with minimal delay :)","Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,5,Great lil vacuum,"First time user of this robot vacuum. It was delivered promptly & well packaged. I downloaded their app & after a week or 2 vacuum started to function in a weird manner. I contacted their customer service & they were very helpful. They informed me I had downloaded the old version of the (RED app), & told me & even sent me the link to the new version (bluegreen app). I did have a bit of trouble connecting it to the WiFi, because it only works with 2.4gHz & after a couple of tries, it Finally Connected & has worked marvelously. I CANNOT COMPLAIN with the job this little vacuum does everyday. I live in a small 1 bedroom apt with the 2 small pet rabbits. This vacuum does as advertised. I love how it maintains the whole apt clean. I have it scheduled to go everyday at the same time, sometimes twice a day since I leave near a heavy traffic zone. It has helped A LOT with pet hair roaming around & dust. EVERYDAY it captures at least a small film of dust which amazes me how well the filter works. In the app other than schedule when you want your vacuum to work, you can also see a map of what was cleaned. The Only bad thing I have to admit that I dislike is that there is no way to block the vacuum from areas you don't want it to pass thru, unless its a heavy chair, a wall or closed door, the vacuum will manage to move whatever it is you put to block. It also doesn't clean very well carpets but its mainly advertised for hardwood floors or similar (plain flat surfaces ex vinyl floor etc); also sometimes it misses some spots. Other than that I like it it also gives you the option of purchasing the mop features as well. Other than that, their customer service is always very attentive, the vacuum as a great buy & it gets the job done!","Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2022"

I am very happy with my robot. The customer service is outstanding. I had a malfunction with my vacuum that seemed to be a damaged battery. I contacted technical support and they sent me a replacement battery for free, they sent me a video on how to change it myself, but it didn't solve the problem. It turned out to be a motherboard issue, so they sent me a completely brand new vacuum cleaner. Since then, I haven't had any problems.

B08R9LK9K3,5,Single mom’s best friend!,"Play Video I LOVE this little guy. I’ve had several different off brand robot vacuums and a few Roombas, so far this is my favorite. I got this when Amazon was offering a deal on them, and after going through the reviews I was a little worried it wouldn’t function well. But if you’re looking for something to keep your floors clean and you’re not too picky, this is the one for you! This is also the most quiet vacuum I’ve owned. It might be a little quirky at times, but it does a great job at figuring out how to get out of a tight spot and makes it way back to get the area clean. It doesn’t get stuck under my furniture, no problems switching between carpet and hardwood, and does a fantastic job at keeping the floors clean. I’ve had it for an entire weekend on its daily schedule, and when I come downstairs in the morning it’s already back on its charging station and the floors look spotless. If you’re looking for a cheaper solution for kitty litter, crumbs, or pet hair I’d absolutely recommend this.

B08R9LK9K3,5,"Strong suction, tough machine, yet gentle on my walls and furniture.","This is a tough little machine, yet gentle on my walls and furniture. It does everything I needed to do. The Dirt bin is a good size so I don't have to worry about it getting full too quickly. The Dual side brushes are great for Corner Cleaning, and picking up pretty much anything. I have very long hair, so I do check the brushes regularly to remove any hair stuck on the brushes. I would like to point out however that my hair does not cause the brushes to stop or get stuck; the machine keeps going and the brushes keep moving! It has 100 minutes of battery life which drops the moment you take it off the charger, but the battery decline slows as the machine is working. I have had this vacuum for over 6 months, and it is still working wonderfully. I should also point out that I have a bunny, therefore the vacuum is used quite often. This machine is thin bodied and great for getting into places that my rabbit has been, but I cannot easily go, in order to clean. No need to move the sofa, which is one of his favorite places to bunny flop. My Lafont comes with a remote control but it can be operated through the app as well. I love the many choices that it gives you. My favorites are wall following, automatic, spot cleaning, and bow cleaning. It also has a timer to set up automatic cleaning; however, I do not use this feature, as I like to be home in case I need to help the machine along. This rarely ever happens though. I have been so impressed with this machine, that I told my sister about it when I knew she was shopping for one. She purchased the Lafont model with 200 minutes of battery life.

B08R9LK9K3,5,I’m in love and I don’t care who knows it,"Where has this been all my life? WiFi: Initial set up with app was a breeze and it didn’t (and still doesn’t) have any connectivity issues to initiate cleaning remotely. Efficacy: It picks up debris very well and it seamlessly runs on hardwood and over low pile rugs without bunching or getting stuck. Runs for about two hours on a 4-5 hour charge. You can also get your kids to quickly pickup their toys by threatening that the robot vacuum is going to get them first. Noise level: We had a roomba back when they first came out (circa 2013) and the reason I got rid of it was because of how loud it was running and bumping into things. Not sure if it’s the brand or better technology but this one seems to be much quieter. I actually couldn’t find it a few times because I couldn’t hear it running and it stops before actually bumping into anything. Honestly, not having to sweep or vacuum is worth way more than 90 bucks to me. I wish I bought this sooner.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2024"

A lot of times people don't understand what they are buying and rate a product unfairly. I have always wanted a vacuum like this, but between Pets, kids, etc I wasn't willing to spend hundreds of dollars on something that would be ruined quickly. I was not shopping for this item when I purchased it. I saw one of those, you may also like .... things, and it caught my eye. After looking at many models in many different price ranges, I thought ok, This particular model was very reasonable priced and had a good rating. I am SOOOO Glad I made this purchase! I will be getting another so I don't have to move it from upstairs to down. It is wonderful! I had it upstairs because it's a pain to drag the vacuum up there. I also get ready for work in the upstairs bathroom which means hair everywhere. I would run it every few days just to clean up the hair. Today, I brought it downstairs for the first time, turned it on and left for work. The house was spotless when I got home, vacuum on the charger as it should. I would recommend this particular unit to anyone that shares some of the same thoughts or feelings I previously had. You will be amazed. Quick and easy set up. I control it from my phone threw an app. I can even start it, stop it, etc from my phone when I am away and not on my personal network. 5 stars all the way!!","Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2022"
B08R9LK9K3,5,I love my Lefant,"It’s just a 2-room apartment and therefore full of chair legs and table legs so I push a lot of things into corners so that there is a clearer bare floor area. But, it’s very good at maneuvering around the barriers that such a small space provides. When it’s done the floor actually shines because it is so well cleaned. I only need to use it once a week since I no longer have pets and live alone. The price was so very reasonable, too. The picture here is before cleaning so you can see a few specks waiting to be cleaned up. That area was done by the time I typed this.","Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,5,Excellent,This vacuum was just what I needed. It is programmable for cleaning sessions and maps well. It does get lost occasionally trying to get back to the base but overall no issues with cleaning. Easy emptying and maintenance.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,5,Great value.,"I put off buying a robot vacuum for years because they are so expensive and I've heard plenty of horror stories about how long hair and pet hair ruin them. The day I swept the hardwood in the living room and kitchen, it was covered in dog hair again. I kind of snapped and started shopping for robot vacuums in earnest because I can only sweep so much. And I found this model on sale. I purchased it immediately and got it the next day. We named it Marvin and Marvin is awesome. This was a really good purchase! No brush to get clogged and tangled. It's relatively easy to set up, very easy to empty the bin, our dog is not afraid of it, and it's quiet enough to run at night without waking us up. It is not very smart, but it is very persistent, and bumps into walls and runs over cords a lot. But that's okay! Because I don't have to sweep daily now and the floor is not covered in dog hair despite our dog's best efforts.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2023"

B08R9LK9K3,5,So far so good,"First I want to say, for everyone complaining about the wifi connection issue: If you have a mobile hotspot on your phone, you can just use that. That's what I did. My mobile hotspot has an option of 5g or 2.4g. But yes, the robot only accepts 2.4g wifi. I like it so far, had it a week. Power lasts about 1.5 hours, and gets about 2.5 rooms depending on the size. This is my first robot vacuum ever so I'm loving my floors getting vacuumed while I'm doing other things. It's very quiet, which I love. Cons: it doesn't have a roller brush, it only sucks air inside from the rectangle hole on the bottome. This doesn't bother me though, it seems to pick up everything in my house just fine. I've been running it once a day. It also gets lost sometimes, gets stuck in some places and sometimes goes over the same path for a long time, thinking it's covering a different area. But this doesn't bother me either, because I can just move it or make it go somewhere else via the app. All in all I love this little thing, it gets one chore done for me when I'm exhausted and busy doing other things, and it was relatively cheap!","Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,5,Not good for pet hair,I had a eufy robot vac and it was the best addition to my life! It killed itself in an unfortunate accident and so I decided to replace it. I found this one for a similar deal so I placed my order. I am so disappointed. My rugs usually hair free after the vacuum goes by has left hair. I had it clean charge and then clean a second time and still the hair remains on the carpet.

B08R9LK9K3,5,Works great for me!,"I wasn't too sure about this vacuum, but after reading the reviews, u decided to give it a chance. I am so glad I did, it works well. I mainly use it for my living room, which used to be a two car garage, so it's big. I connected to Alexa, and the ease of using it is great. Also, emptying the canister is simple, and quick.

B08R9LK9K3,5,Impressive,"After having disappointing experiences with previous robot vacuums (Holove brand purchased 3 years ago) I was impressed when I saw a Lefant vacuum at someone else's house, so I bought one myself. It has only been here for a few days, but I love this little machine so much. It runs quietly and gets to work with gusto. This model sucks up probably 5+ times as much dust and pet hair as any previous robot vac I've had. It also has an extremely logical method for covering the entire area, which is nice to see. It docks itself perfectly and without noise. I currently only use it on hard floors. I did not find that pairing with the app was very user friendly, so I abandoned the project. It was not important to me to use the app so I didn't try very hard. If it had been easy to pair I might have used it, but it's not a big deal to me to just press the start button each day. It came with an extra filter and an extra set of brushes, which was nice. Obviously time will tell as to how well this vac works long term, but for now I am very pleased.","Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,5,Bought two,"These are workers. I had a much more expensive one that auto emptied into a container. With two dogs it was always getting clogged and would not finish or empty right. With these they absolutely clean 30 times better. They run about 2 hours each day. They will go under my sectional. The one I had before did not. I cannot find a set mapping or boundary for them, however I really don’t mind. They get into places the last one never would. It does not have a roller but no complaints with less tangles. Each one picks up so much. Now my floors do not look like I have pets. So far worth the money. I purchase Black Friday when about $89 an each. Also with two running at same time pretty quiet.","Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,5,You get your money's worth!!,"I love this vacuum 😍 it does a thorough cleaning job. It uses GPS and starts by mapping out the dimensions of the room. Once it totally is able to map out the area with any obstacles, rugs, desk, tables...it will not bump them the next go around. A full carpet vacuum of the area depending on the size takes 3 hours. It even lifts up the rugs and once it memorize the length of the rugs and rooms it slows down and deep sweep the edges...if it gets stuck it stops for a second to 🤔 think...Yes. I said to ""think"" and it will do a full circle to see the best exit and when it got caught under my kitchen stand, it lowered itself and backed out from under the stand!! I call him ""TED"" Ted is one of the best investment I have ever made and I don't know how I have lived without this vacuum... when it first started vacuuming the room I thought it wasn't picking up all of the lint so I turned it off but I now know it goes in a set formation and it sweeps every inch, square foot of the area. I believe via its computer algorithm it creates and memorize every section, area it touches and goes back over it... I would recommend purchasing. It works excellent on hardwood floors, tile....I give it a 10. On carpets a 9 only because if you have a cat or dog it will have to take longer to lift the carpet fibers and suck up the hair...still figuring out all of the functions so I may be able to switch from wood and carpet...it does have a way to increase suction power. Please excuse any misspelling...typing fast.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2022"
B08R9LK9K3,4,I named it Pierre,"I love my little robot. It gets the job done. I gave it 4 stars for a few reasons: 1. After having it for over a year, it doesn't always start when told. Sometimes I have to turn it off and turn it back on OR unplug it. Sometimes it just refuses to work and so I have to come back to it later. This is the most frustrating aspect, but it usually does resume working. 2. The scheduled cleaning doesn't work. It could be because I'm not connected to the internet, but the schedule on the remote doesn't do it's thing even though it will allow you to set it up. 3. It picks and chooses when to bump into things. Ex. I have a metal dog bowl full of water on the floor, it will bump into it repeatedly and sometimes push it across the floor, but with a random box on the floor, it will completely avoid it after getting close. 4. It does get tangled sometimes, but that's not enough of a reason to not use it. Pros: 1. Came with two filters so I can clean one while the other stays in. 2. My dog sheds and this helps keep the hair on my floor to a minimum. 3. On low, it's pretty quiet. I tend to run it on high though so I have to adjust to the noise. 4. The remote makes the cleaning process a little more personal. You can redirect the vacuum over specific spaces. 5. The ease of using a robot vacuum is great. You don't have to stand over it to make sure it's doing what it needs to do. You turn it on and forget about it. 6. The battery life is decent. It cleans on high power for an hour and some change (1 bedroom apartment about 750 Sq ft).","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,4,"Works well, app compatibility is an issue I was aware of","It runs really well, great suction, lasts long enough to cover the 4 rooms I need it for. It's also fairly quiet and has no trouble going from the hardwood to the throw rug. The app isn't compatible with my internet so I just push the button to get it going and when it cries out that it's ready to go home, I fetch it and put it in front of the charging pad and it coasts right in. I'd read about the app issue and could not speak to how it is (someone else mentioned reprogramming their wifi but I'm not trying all that) but it still works well without it. Now for the problem over which it has no control so I didn't dock it any stars. I got it because I have two young cats, and was concerned the bigger one, who tends to be more timid, would be scared of it. Nope! She and her twin sister immediately starting bothering the robot so much, I had to physically move them so it wouldn't just be going in circles. The sensors are really good, so as they keep getting in front of it, it will just spin around to avoid them. They pester the poor robot to the extent that I have to pick it up periodically and put it in another spot for it to really make progress. The big twin is actually the worst, and has learned how to turn it on by hitting the button on top. Usually, they just block it from coming out until it gives up and goes back home. Essentially, not at all what I expected but better than them feeling terrorized by a scary robot. It works great when they let it, maneuvers most of the house well (has trouble with one divisor strip that is a bit thick), compacts all the pet hair and dust, and lasts a long time. Also wears the cats out for a long, quiet, peaceful nap afterwards. So glad I got this!","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,4,Honestly Worth It!,"I tested this out on a rainy day (after the floor dried of course). We have four dogs - two are long haired - so our floors are a lot to keep up with. I ordered this robot vacuum to help take some of the workload off of me so that I can manage my floors better. Currently, we only have wood floors in the kitchen, and I was so shocked when I emptied the dirt bin after it was finished!! It picked up so much dog hair and dust/dirt. YOU NEED THIS! Our kitchen is pretty large, and it took about 45 minutes for this little machine to clean it. It’s not loud at all, unless it bumps into the cabinets or trash can, and even then it’s not loud. It did have a hard time finding its charging dock so I manually “drove” it back, so I’m curious to see if it’ll find its dock while I’m at work and not here monitoring the vacuum the whole time. Overall I’m super impressed!","Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,4,Great for the price.,"I have a husky and Samoyed. I wanted something to help keep up with their fur after my iRobot vacuum died. For the price, this is great. It’s quiet, the charge lasts a long time, and it does pretty well picking up debris and fur. For $88, don’t expect perfection, it does miss some spot cleanup, but it’s easy to setup, the app is functional, & the dust bin holds a decent amount of dog hair before I need to dump it. Overall, I’d recommend its purchase at the price point.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,4,Circular layouts confuse it.,"I love in an old house with uneven floors and different kinds of floors, stairs, and low pile rugs. The layout is an 8 shape but we keep the door that completes the bottom loop closed so the robot sees like a 9 shape. I had to start limiting it to just our high traffic areas because it would go over the same spots over and over again. It would seem to be under our love seat for 30 mins... So then it would run out of battery before finishing the whole layout. So now robot is limited to the kitchen/laundry/bathroom but it works well for that. It still seems to get confused if things aren't in the same place every day so I do have to get up to make sure nothing is in it's way before it runs but generally I'd say it helps a lot. I certainly clean out the catch often enough, 2 cats and my boyfriend in the kitchen certainly make a lot of mess so it is DEFINITELY helping. I normally run it in powerful mode. I will say that the app controls are a little disappointing. The manual control does not seem to work at all, I'll send it in one direction and then it won't let me change direction at all. Not really sure the benefit of the ""random"" path finding function. Overall I'm happy with the purchase given the price, but I will likely upgrade to a different brand in the future.","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,4,Great for the price,"Given how low the price is, it actually works wonderful. I use mine daily for the past 6 months and it still works just as good as it did on day one. PROS: •great for pet hair, lint, dust, allergens. It fills the compartment completely even when I didn’t think I had that much on my floors. •app includes manual control. If I want it to work in a different room I can use my phone to manually drive it over to where I want, then reactivate cleaning mode. •Great price. I spent under $100 for mine and so far I have no regrets. •Scheduling! The app allows you to schedule when you would like it to activate. CONS: •Struggles with larger crumbs. I don’t use mine as a replacement for vacuuming, so it struggling to pick up a Cheeto is fine for me. I have children with allergies and I have two cats, so my primary use for this device is a daily pet dander cleaner in between me vacuuming. It does a wonderful job at collecting cat hair. •Battery life. I wish it was a tad bit longer. It lasts about 40-60 min. The good news is, when it needs recharging it drives itself to the charger. So it doesn’t just die wherever it happens to be. OVERALL: I recommend it. I’m a big fan of saving money where I can, and this device is one of those things that you can save money on and still receive something of quality.","Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2024"

Yes the vacuum has some kinks but I would give this company another try just based off their costumer service. This is…yikes. You get what you pay for. Issues started right way. They sent the wrong directions with the vacuum and I was only able to set it up thanks to a YouTube video. Even then, set up was difficult and took me awhile. There were issues with the robot finding the internet network. Secondly, this doesn’t “map your house.” I have been trying to use the ‘arranged’ function and it spins in circles for 5 minutes and then attempts to line sweep the house but turns randomly every 10 seconds even if there’s nothing in its way. Thirdly, it started squeaking after 3 days. 🥴 I will say it’s very cheap and it does eventually get the living room and kitchen done but that’s about it. It can’t seem to find my hallway.

B08R9LK9K3,4,Great Little Cleaner,"I don't have a lot of space to vacuum, but my ex lost almost all the pieces to my old vaccums including my Shark robot which I loved...so I ordered one here from amazon but it came without a rotating brush and I could have swore the description said it had one...but I guessed that was my bad for assuming. Anyway, I wanted something that'd sweep so I didn't have to (don't ask me why, but I'd rather vacuum than sweep) and saw this on sale for $89 here and boy did I get it at the right time. A few days after I purchased mine, the price went back up by more than 100%. So, does it work? Yep. I downloaded the companion app and... ...was never able to connect on my phone, which was disappointing...and this is what scored only 4 stars instead of 5. Do you need the app in order to use it? No, but an awful lot of the features are unavailable however without it...and I found that annoying to say the least. However, just walking over and pressing the power button to activate it certainly isn't a deal breaker for me. I've used it several times and I've found that for what I use it for most, it works flawlessly. Now, keep in mind that means I've prepped the area ahead of time so that it won't accidentally get snagged on a stray shoelace or something else that could cause problems. A friend of mine said that was annoying to have to do and I asked him for his upright vacuum if he didn't have to bend down and move those same items before he manually used his upright and he admitted that yes, he did. So what's the big difference? He had to physically vacuum his house. I just prepped and turned my robot on and it did the rest, including coming back to the charger when it was finished. Seriously, the convenience factor alone is worth the price...and the fact I got mine for such a great price? Even better.

For the price, I think I’m happy with it, but I wonder about the battery life and whether we should go with a different model. I have noticed that even after a full charge, the vacuum can’t finish all of our area without getting down to the 15% mark (at which point it stops vacuuming and makes it way back to its base). I’m curious if we need to use it in a different mode (we’re using standard mode). Going to try a few more days before we return it. I have heard positive things about Lefant customer service and am hopeful we can get some support with this issue (or if there’s a recommendation for a different model from this company that might do better in terms of battery life for a larger space).","Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,4,Mo gets the job done.,"Bought this over a year ago and we are still going strong...we named our vacuum ""Mo"" from the movie Wall-E. Because it seems like he is always trying to clean in areas not needed 🤦‍♀️. Mo does not have a specific pattern per say. He kind of just goes everywhere and then when his battery is low he wonders around the house trying to find his home. We typically feel bad for him and just carry him back to his spot. Downsides: no alert when holder is full, we have dogs and so pet hair is an obvious, no alert is annoying and results in us chasing Mo around to empty him. Not going to clean carpets at all, although will pick up bigger items, but if you're expecting it to clean the hair out, it won't. Will sometimes get hyper focused on one area, like our chair ... we have to move Mo onto another section because he will just keep running into the chair. Will sometimes yeet himself off the stairs, it only happened a couple times, I think he learned his lesson though because he hasn't done it in some time now. The app is not always user friendly, tried to use the ""map my house"" part and it worked a couple times and then just stopped.

Harry will happily clean every inch. He has willingly (and successfully) vacuumed a loose shag rug as well as a high density, high pile shag rug. He even tried to go through the slider to do the sun room(don't worry, I saved him). He's dedicated, determined, and has a superior work ethic. I'm not sure about navigation as I've never paid attention while he's working. I was slightly concerned that he waited until 8-10% battery before heading home after a long days work, but he's made it safe and sound after each shift. I love the app, which connected seamlessly.

Shoelaces, even if just barely touching the floor. 2. USB cables of any kind. 3. Yarn 4. String 5. Leaves?? Really? 6. Nerf Darts 7. Confetti 8. Packing foam sheets 9. rugs that are not nailed to the floor 10. Every cat toy ever made anywhere. 11. May the Lord help you if your dog has an accident indoors; this robot will make your floors into a poop crime scene. I had to remove the two front spinners just to get it to finish a cleaning, most of the list above was with them OFF. If you have ANY furniture that is low enough for it to get under it will try, and usually get stuck there. I swear it raises UP under my couch! It has no touch sensor at all, the front ""face"" is fixed in place, and so it relies on IR sensors to avoid obstacles, this is great unless the obstacle is black. It will plow into dark things over and over. Once when the edge of a throw blanket was touching the floor down from a couch it tried to eat the whole thing. It does that with anything low hanging. Almost every time the robot got stuck during cleaning I would get a notice that the job was successful. If it gets stuck it can run the battery out trying to escape! The ""find my device"" function is useless if the battery is dead. If you pick it up at any point in the cleaning cycle it resets its temporary ""map"" and will probably not find its charging base. I have to do so much prep work before it cleans that I might as well just sweep up myself. On the plus side the App is much better than iRobots, even if it doesn't save maps. The ability to change suction power is great! The quiet mode is really great,","Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,4,Customer service top notch,"Edit 07/02/2024 - I was surprised to receive an email from the company’s customer service. They were reaching out to try to make things right, as my previous review was brutally honest. I received an option for a full refund or to receive a replacement at no charge. The email was kind and apologetic, only focused on how to make things right. To be honest, I was outside of the refund period, and had succumbed to just being out he money I spent. It is refreshing to know a company still cares about their customers and will take care of problems that arise. I have changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars because the company is willing to do what is right. They have noted that problems I noted will be addressed by their team to correct the issues. Previous post for reference: This vacuum worked fine for a couple weeks on a daily schedule, but after the couple weeks would beep incessantly while charging. The beeps would occur every five minutes, with a cadence and beep count that could not be found in any troubleshooting documentation. I finally turned off the power and stopped using it out of frustration. Upon attempting to restart, the unit will turn on but will not work or respond to the button. So disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024"

I knew it was not the top brand but i just wanted something to pick up the animal hair during the week in between real cleanings. About two weeks in 1 wheel stops working and all it does is spin in a circle. There is nothing jammed and I can move the wheel myself and of course it was the same time that the return window closed.

B08R9LK9K3,4,Good dumb vaccum,"I am loving this vacuum, but there is a few major flaws. I purchased this on sale so for $88 it was completely worth it. The amount of dirt and hair this thing picks up is unbelievable. He is my new favorite coworker, I set him in the main rooms and let him do his thing. He will stumble in the other rooms and I will shut the door so he can clean the whole room since he really doesn’t have a memory function. I have not had luck having any map saved. It does whatever it wants really, doesn’t have a rhyme or reason. It’s hard to get it to go to the dock if it’s not in the same room. But that’s ok, cause I manually drive it back and it’ll park itself usually when in the same room. For the money it is worth it for the ease and amount of hair and dirt it picks up. But it does need babysat, don’t trust it to clean your whole house and return home with you not there to babysit or guide it. Other than that it works great. I bought two. I mainly plan on using them just for select rooms, so it works for what I need it for.","Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,4,"It does a good job on flat surfaces, not too good on carpet.","This robot vacuum has been a fantastic addition to my cleaning routine. One of its best features is the ability to schedule cleaning times. Waking up to a clean floor and returning home to one, especially with a Cane Corso at home, is truly a delight. Its sturdy design gives me confidence that this beauty will last a long time. I particularly appreciate the adjustable ""obstacle avoidance sensitivity,"" which helps prevent damage to walls and furniture. The battery life is impressive, easily allowing it to clean my entire first floor, including the kitchen, living room, and dining room. However, there are a couple of drawbacks. The suction power on carpet could be stronger, and it doesn't save the floor map, which means it might miss spots occasionally. I've also noticed that even in ""powerful mode,"" some hair is left on the carpet. Despite these minor issues, this robot vacuum serves its purpose well and saves me a lot of manual sweeping.","Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024"

I have had trouble connecting to wi-fi, but have been able to just turn it on, and let it run without the app. It has occasionally gotten stuck, but not often enough to be an annoyance. This has even been able to go over bathroom rugs without issue, but I would assume thicker rugs could cause it to get stuck. It has made life a bit easier, and that was the reason for purchase!

Our apartment is small, we let it clean about 4 rooms, I don’t think this would work as well in larger areas. Cleans for about 90 minutes before it goes to charge. It is fairly good about putting itself back on the charger when it can. Took some time for us to find a place for the charger that seemed to work best for it. Occassionally gets stuck or loses a sweeper leg. It does not seem to memorize the rooms and even on it’s “arranged” mode seems to move somewhat randomly. Our shag bath mat was too thick so we now move it out of its way. Great to have clean while you are out of the house.

B08R9LK9K3,4,Maybe better for hardwood,"Update: Well, I got a new unit from the factory and let me tell you, there customer service is AMAZING! I've been using this vacuum in a different area of my house and so far so good. The Pros: The battery lasts forever it seems! It does two bedrooms, a walkin closet, a hallway, a landing and a bathroom before it goes back to the charger! It goes back to the charger every time (I hope I didn't just jinx that)! And this is after going from one bedroom, to the hallway, to another bedroom, to the hallway then landing then to a bathroom, then back to the hallway, to my bedroom and my walk in closet and then back to the charger. It's amazing! Oh, did I mention that on the landing there is a cliff and stairs. It hasn't fallen off once (again, I hope I didn't just jinx that)! Update: I ran my Roomba in the same place and the Roomba got stuck on the ledge the first time out. Roomba 0 Lefant 1! Super light and quiet Its been picking stuff up better than the first unit I got, but its still missing the big stuff. I was kindly sent directions from CS on how to increase the suction, so I'm hoping that will cure it. Its super gentle when it runs into things. Stay tuned for an update after I figure out how to make the suction stronger and I give it the roomba3 test The pros: super easy to set up, light, super quiet, didn’t get stuck on things other vacuums would. The cons: I would say it picked up half the dirt and hair that my Rumba 960 does. I would run this vacuum and then run my Rumba960 and my Rumba would collect a ton of dirt this guy missed. When I reversed that challenge, this vacuum would be empty. I think this might work better on hardwood floors as it had a suction hole on the bottom vs brushes. The price is great at $-123 but it doesn’t really work that well so….:-( For - a couple hundred bucks more u can get the Rumba i3 which works just as good if not better than my Rumba960, which is what I ended up doing. The i3 was just as quiet as this guy and my floors are emasculate even with a Shiba Inu.","Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2021"
B08R9LK9K3,4,Works good but I want to control it,"I bought this to replace our Thamtu, which we broke (totally our fault unrelated to performance). Robot vacs are annoying in my house because we have rugs with fringe and have to pick them up or fold the fringe under. Also, I have a TV/entertainment center with lots of cords that I don't want the robot vac touching. For the Thamtu, it came with a magnetic strip that you put in front of the entertainment center so it avoided it. For this one, there was no easy barrier. In order to block it, I had to put a cardboard sheet or box or something in front of it so the vacuum wouldn't go under the entertainment center. It also seemed to stay in one area for a long time and didn't really clean the whole floor. I'm probably returning it, too much work to prep.","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,4,Good vacuum good Customer Service Support,"I bought my Lafant vacuum back in April through Amazon. When it arrived it was easy to set up and it started working immediately. It did such a great job that I named it Agador Spartacus from the 1996 movie The Birdcage. But, unfortunately, it started to act up a month or two ago. It was only turn left, was making wide arcs to the left, and it would also not find the charging station. I contacted the Lafant via their customer service and they have been very helpful at fixing my issue. At first they had me troubleshoot by watching videos and disassembling my vacuum so I could inspect the wheel assembly to make sure nothing was impeding their proper function. Next they sent me a new wheel assembly to see if that would fix my issue. Unfortunately, that did not fix the issues. Now they are sending me a new replacement vacuum. Communication with Lafant Customer Service is a bit slow but it is understandable, we are in totally different time zones so when I am asleep they are working and when they are sleeping I am working. When they sent me a replacement wheel assembly it was shipped from the factory very quickly, but shipping took a while. It was stuck in customs for what felt like forever.

B08R9LK9K3,4,Actually better than I first thought,"Update: it's really not bad at all for the price. It's a bit slow and takes a lot of passes for it to clean the carpet, but it actually does get it done. So, I think this is definitely best for daily scheduled cleanings. I set it and realized a few days later the carpet was very clean! Not having a sweeper brush does make it slower, but on the other hand, they're correct that that's something you don't have to clean! It's been a long time since I've had an actually Roomba, but I do recall it being a major ordeal to clean its brush. By the way: as some have noted, even this one will occasionally slurp up a usb cable or get caught in wires. I actually think this is a hidden benefit of robot vacuums though. You have to keep your place robot safe, but that had the side benefit that you have to keep your place tidier! And it quickly becomes second nature to not leave something out the robot will get tripped up on. Old review: At the moment I'm a bit disappointed, but I just got it and may revise my rating. It just seems like the suction isn't strong enough. I wish I had gotten one with a sweeper unit. I didn't get it with a need for the app at all, nor did I expect to use the app. But I installed it and it's actually kind it nifty and fun.

B08R9LK9K3,4,"""Ok"" for the price","I have no prior experience with a robot vacuum so I didn't know what to expect. I was initially impressed with the overall quality of the unit, and the performance seemed ""ok"" but I have to keep reminding myself that it only cost $100. The vacuum unit spends a lot of battery life trying to get around obstacles and seems to have a hard time finding its way back to the home base. It usually makes it home after a long search, but sometimes it runs out of battery or gets stuck. That's not a big deal as long as you're not counting on it to run on a schedule all by itself. (I think the navigation algorithm needs work.) Suction power is pretty good. We have a couple of new wool rugs and the vacuum sucks up a lot of the loose fibers each time. We have a large master bedroom with carpet; I close the door and let it run until the battery dies. The ""stripes"" it makes in the carpet indicate very good coverage on the random pattern. It does get stuck on power cords and cables so you have to make sure they're tucked out of the way. We still do a once-a-week deep clean with a regular vacuum cleaner, but this helps keep floors clean between deep cleans. We currently have no pets so I can't comment on pet hair. I would have rated this unit 2 or 3 stars based on expectations for optimal performance, but gave it 4 because it's pretty good for the price.","Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2023"

But I honestly have been really impressed with him. He gets in all the nooks and crannies because he’s smaller, and he doesn’t have rollers so nothing gets stuck.

B08R9LK9K3,4,Very good budget robot vacuum for hardwood floors,"This little guy is a very good robot vacuum that does a nice job for my needs. I am using this solely in a single room (an office that essentially is a converted garage) with hardwood floors - no carpets, no pets. This low cost vacuum can be controlled by either the supplied remote or “Lefant Life” app. I run it on weekdays at 1:00am and each morning when I enter my office the floor is clean. The dust bin is a decent size, it’s fairly quiet, comes with 2 extra side brushes and an extra filter. So why is it 4 stars and not 5? Well, about 1/2 the time, I find that one of the side brushes becomes disconnected during a cleaning (see picture from this morning). Also, programming the remote is clunky at best - and figuring out how to program the app was a challenge. I’ve attached a screen shot of the app where you set up the automatic cleaning - in the app, select “Smart” at the bottom and create an “Automation”. One last reason I docked it a star - there is another Lefant app on the Apple Store, simply entitled “Lefant”. I downloaded that, it recognized the robot, but would not connect. I went through it multiple times before taking a shot at downloading “Lefant Life”. That one worked flawlessly and easily, but wasn’t specified in the setup instructions. Bottom line - it’s pretty cheap and does a very good job for my needs. The app and instructions need some work.","Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2022"
B08R9LK9K3,4,Better than when I (occasionally) vacuum,"I am a terrible housekeeper and I feel like I only run the sweeper when the carpet looks completely covered in pet hair and pieces of chewed up dog toys, so I figured if this robo-sweeper worked at all, it would be better than what I do, and I was right. I didn't install the app and don't know how to program it, so I don't know about any of that, but if I can be bothered to pick up cords and toys and turn this vacuum on, it does a good job roaming around and sucking up the sad detritus of our busy lives. It runs for 90 minutes to 2 hours, and has never returned to its base. I always pick it up when its battery fails and put it back in the dock. __ **Edit 6/5/23** It can find its way back to the dock! I had occasion to be out of the house when it got low on battery power, and when I came back, it had put itself on charge. ___ It does manage to sweep up my living room and kitchen in that time, and its little hopper is always full (also easy to empty). It does get stuck under the sofa occasionally, but I think it is training itself not to go under there. Sadly I don't even run this robot vacuum often enough for it to keep things real tidy, so I am not for sure that it is learning about the sofa trap, but I think it is. All in all, at this price (I think I got it on Prime Days for $99) it was worth it to make sure my carpet gets vacuumed at least every now and then!","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2022"

I ordered this as my 3rd one...It is quiet and smaller than the others. It is taller than the eufy, so it doesn't get under things. There isn't a spin brush in the center like the others...so I don't think it's getting as much stuff up as the previous two vacs. But the side brushes are longer than usual...battery life is just so so. I tried to upload the app but it doesn't seem to work for me.

B08R9LK9K3,4,Little powerhouse,"I have had a couple of robot vacuums. They have a big job at our house, with four large dogs, three being long haired and two being Pyrenees. Any Pyr owner will understand their fur is next level 😄. The Lefant vacuum has been my favorite robot. Others have had design flaws (at least as far as fur goes) or broke down every couple of months and they had to send new ones or parts. The Lefant has been holding up for over a year. I LOVE that it has no brush for the fur to get tangled in!! The two sweeper brushes are a must, one isn't enough. It does a great job getting the fur and dust and it has held up so well. I run it at least daily, if not twice a day. It could use a longer battery life. This model lasts about an hour and a half or so. I have a rather large area and it doesn't quiet last long enough, but for all the benefits, that is far from a deal breaker. Recently I had an issue with it not running properly. Lefant customer service was very quick to respond and help me solve the problem. There was fur stuck in the drive wheel...imagine that 😂😂.

I love that we can schedule him to clean while we are at work. He does have some difficulty getting back to his home at times. In the grand scheme though....our floors get cleaned more regularly and he was worth it!!","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,4,Was great- for the price.,"I got it on half off sale, and that made it most worthwhile. Biggest complaints are that it doesn’t go to home to charge when the battery gets low, it would just run until dead and it doesn’t remember very easily- It will clean the same spaces repeatedly. I have it set automatically for a couple of days a week to hopefully get everywhere once.","Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,4,Very close to returning this. Customer support doesn't reply. Ever,"Yes another update. The company sent me a new machine after seeing my review. Changing my start for now. I will update in the future. Update: Since I could get absolutely no reply, not even an auto reply to my questions, I opted to return it. When I did, I was not told of a ""restocking fee"". I didn't know about it until I saw got the refund. So word to the wise. So they sell a defective product. Don't reply at all to questions for help and then keeps part of the purchase price for their defective product. The vacuum itself doesn't do a bad job. I have 2 issues. First, the remote won't link up despite following the directions to the letter. I'm not clueless about tech, so this should work and it doesn't. Second and this one is super annoying. Every time the vacuum docks itself, you have to physically open the top and turn it off and back on again to start it. I have no idea why this would be. I have emailed support twice. A couple weeks apart and haven't even gotten a canned reply. I just can't see keeping this since I can't set it to run automatically, which is what my other one (different brand that works perfectly) does.","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2022"
B08R9LK9K3,4,It really is good!,"Let me start by saying it's very rare for me to write review. I was skeptical about this robot vacuum due to the reviews and because I bought it on a lightening deal without doing any research and oh boy!! was I surprised! I got it exactly a week ago and it's been running daily around the house. We have a vanilla shiba inu dog, he is one year old and he sheds a lot. This is why I got the little robot with help with hair because the sweeping, mopping and vacuum just was not enough and I needed more help. I am so amazed with how well it runs, picks up the hair and how it's able to navigate the house. We mostly have wooden floors and some area rugs. I also like it's able to get unstuck on its own and go over cords! the set up was easy and fast. My 12 year old son connected it right away with the app. The packaging was impeccable and we used it as soon as we opened the box. Now we can be barefoot again or with socks around the house and no longer find heary socks, which were impacting the washer and dryer! I wish I could upload pictures and video but I am having some challenges. I really recommend this product to ALL PET OWNERS!","Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2022"

B08R9LK9K3,4,This Vacuum Saved My Marriage,"Look. I was skeptical about robotic vacuums. They seemed expensive, and all I heard was how they were good at one thing - getting stuck at inopportune moments. My wife and I enjoy our ""netflix and chill"" sessions, but if the house was dusty, it often didn't get us in the mood. I could vacuum by hand, but while effective, I would sometimes be tired afterwards and end up falling asleep. With the Lefant M210, those problems are over. This nice little robot fits the budget, first of all. Much cheaper than the super fancy models (which likely have more features). In the end, I got this thing setup. Firmware took a while to update, but when it runs, it helps keep our floors in decent shape. Is it perfect? Does it hit everything? No, but it works. I am always surprised at how much dust it picks up in its cute little compartment. Easy to empty too! While it does get lost trying to find its way to its charging base and sometimes runs out of power during its clean, it doesn't spoil the mood by whining. My wife and I are able to do our netflix and chill and return the cleaner after the latest Stranger Things episode is finished. It's been a big blessing to my marriage!","Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2022"

I have mine run daily while I work. Takes about 3.5 hours on average for 2000sq ft. I also pick it up and have it spot clean messes for me such as in the kitchen and several times in the garage. It's nice just to set it down, hit start, and return to a clean floor. Vacuum does a good job at edge cleaning which is something my last vacuum wasn't too good at.

My friend convinced me that I needed one in my house to save my energy to use for other things. I’m disabled and tire easily, with two kittens in the house they constantly track litter everywhere. My son set up the vacuum for me. The app was simple and easy to understand. I have wood floors with several area rugs and I was concerned about the vacuum clearing the height difference. I set it up to go off nightly and have the cleanest floors since I moved into the house almost two years ago. Fun fact you can customize the name of your vacuum in the app. The two dislikes would be how quickly the dirt compartment fills up (my dirty house) and that my kittens chase the brushes as it runs.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023"

I used to struggle with keeping up with all the dog hair my black Great Dane sheds on all my light floors but I run this vacum to go off twice a day and I hardly ever have to actually vacum myself. The only reasons why it’s not a super five stars is that it can get itself stuck once in awhile since it doesn’t remember that it got stuck there before but it doesn’t happen often enough for it to be a real problem. It also scrapes a little paint off my stair railings sometimes when it’s trying to navigate around them but not consistently enough for me to not use it because it does an amazing job at getting stuff off the floor when I thought they were clean.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2023"

Hasn't gotten stuck and finds its way back to the charger each time. Edited: the customer service for Leafant is the best I've ever had to work with. They sent me a remote for the robot which allows me to access the features that I couldn't with the app. As such, the robot does great at its job. I'm very pleased with it!

This vacuum sucks up all of the fur and sand effortlessly and tangle free on my hardwood floors! Very easy to use and the app is great. I can’t quite figure out how to send it to a particular room yet besides using the manual controls, but that honestly doesn’t bother me because it cleans every room in the house on a single charge anyway. I can’t attest to how well it works on carpet, but I’d imagine it would do just fine to keep your floors looking great in between deep cleans with your regular vacuum!

Great suction, really cleans up dog hair and other small debris. I was surprised at just how well it worked and how quickly it would fill up the dust bin. Now for the robot and automation score. Overall not so bad. Put it on auto and it'll zip around randomly doing it's thing. It does have an issue with actually finding another room, but that's ok. I'll just pick it up and move it to other rooms and set it off on its way again. Sometimes it seems to get itself going over and over the same general area, but eventually bumps into something and merrily putters off to a new area. Bad stuff. It won't find the charging base. Ever. It appears to be dependent on it seeing the infrared sensor in the base, and that's just near impossible if it's in another room. The poor thing will wander around aimlessly running it's battery down trying to find the base. And it's not vacuuming in that mode. More bad stuff. The app sucks. Like is almost completely useless. And don't think you're getting a vacuum that will map your house like in the picture above. Nope. Complete BS. Doesn't happen. Overall however, I'm really happy with this little guy.

B08R9LK9K3,4,Worth every penny,"I ordered this vacuum to help me keep up with the dog hair and debris on the 1st floor of my house. Downstairs we have hardwood floors and a couple of area rugs. The vacuum does a great job of getting up the dog hair (I have a yellow lab that sheds A LOT). I believe this specific vacuum is for hardwoods and low pile carpet, and I agree with that description. I run the vacuum almost everyday, it's nice to turn on and not think about it. Before getting the Lefant vacuum, I would use a swiffer and broom Downstairs. I can honestly say, I have not used my swiffer since I got this vacuum. However, I do still use my normal push (Bissell) vacuum for the area rugs because the Lefant doesn't do the greatest on the carpet. It does alright with getting some debris up, however.

I run the vacuum three or four times a week. You can schedule cleaning, but I’m always around when it’s running to avoid encounters with the inevitable random cat puke.

For starters I wish the robot went back to the charger before it dies. Every time I come home it’s smack dead in the middle of the floor and I have to take it back to its hub. Secondly please develop a way to set designated “No Go” areas. It’s very frustrating when I’m watching tv and it has found a way behind my tv stand eating my cords and unplugging things. The sensitivity just isn’t enough. Also saving a map of your home instead of recreating one every time on start up. Everything else is great. I love the timers and the quiet and powerful settings.

B08R9LK9K3,3,It's lost,"I've tested this and used it for 2 days now. Cleans well enough and does not fall down the stairs. Using the Lefant app is almost impossible to use with Alexa. Instead, use the Smart life app. Once paired with the smart life app it will erase itself from the Lefant app and will be recognized by Alexa. From there you can transfer it to the Lefant app in order for it to be recognized by Alexa. I deleted the Lefant app and just used the smart life app being that I already have it on my phone to control my lights. One less app using up the memory and storage of my phone. The duration of the battery is an hour and a half or 90 minutes give or take 5 minutes which is good enough to clean 2 bedrooms, a den and a long hallway. There is an area rug in my den, hallway, and 1 bedroom and it managed to go over them without any problems most of the time. Whats irritating is when its done its job and needs to go back to the charging dock. It spends so much time looking for the charging dock that it runs out of power before being able to dock. It keeps passing the dock which is just 1 or 2 feet away. But here is what I noticed, when I press home on the remote and the unit is 5 feet or less away in a straight line from the charging dock, it'll never (maybe sometimes) find the dock. But if its more than 7 or 8 feet away it manages to find the charging dock. I initially place the charging dock on the short end of the hallway (middle of the hallway, around 5 feet across) while testing it and only once was it able to find the charging dock. But when I placed it in the living room, the wall where I placed the charging dock was across another wall around 20-25 feet away, it manages to find the charging dock always. Seems like it needs a long path (like a runway) to prep itself and make a bee line towards the dock. Makes me want to return this because of that but still thinking it over because I do like the color as it does not show the dust which accumulates on the top of it. I have a black one and you can see the dust which sticks to the sides of the unit as if though it has been off roading. If I were to compare this to a vacuum with a roller brush, the roller brush wins without question. I tested this the first time by running the Lefant once a day for 5 days in three rooms which have 10 x 7 area rugs and a hallway runner which is 12 feet long by 3 feet. These rugs have been manually vacuumed twice a week with a regular (the type that you pull with you) vacuum and results seem to show that the robot vacuum did a better job. I then ran a robot vacuum with a roller brush for just once for 75 minutes. The vacuum with the roller brush deep cleaned the the rugs way much better and actually vacuumed out more dust and lint than the Lefant. That was 5 days at 100 minutes per use with the Lefant vs 1 use for 75 minutes with a roller brushed robot vacuum. First dust pile is the Lefant. Second is the roller brushed vacuum. The proof says it all. Though the lefant does a good job, it could be better. Its fine I guess but compared to a Eufy 30C, i prefer the Eufy over this. More elegant, it has a roller brush which lifts the dust off the carpet though hair gets caught on the roller but its not that hard to remove. I would rather that the dust gets lifted out of the carpet than just off the surface. And the Eufy always finds its way to the chraging dock. I'm testing another unit by Acecool, seems to be the same as the Lefant M210, even the manual of the Acecool mentions the M210. Acecool has a bigger capacity battery with a running time of 170 minutes (don't know if its true but I am testing it right now, its been running for an hour and 10 minutes as I write this) and the same features. They look almost the same in size, the body structure, and dust bin. The only difference is the color and the top cover. Only thing I don't like about the Acecool is that its black and fell down the stairs when I used the edge (wall) cleaning mode. I think the wheel slipped since the sides of these units don't have side sensors. Acecool does go over the carpets much better and seems more solid compared to the Lefant. Still testing. At the moment, a 3 star rating is the best I can give the Lefant M210","Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2022"
B08R9LK9K3,3,Works in the barest sense of the word,"I purchased this while recovering from surgery and couldn't use my arms and thus the regular vacuum. It's better than nothing but the poor thing wanders around in the most random patterns and appears to specifically avoid dust, dirt, and crumbs on the floor so I always have to sweep before or after to have an actually clean floor. It can get from the wood floor in the hallway into my sons' rooms without issue but has to be physically lifted and placed to get into my bedroom with exactly the same carpeting which kind of defeated the purpose of having purchased it because I wasn't supposed to be using my arms to lift anything including this relatively light vacuum. I'm surprised to find there's ever anything actually in the canister to empty and suspect it's slightly better on carpet than wood floors where the brushes just shoot things around rather than into the path of the vacuum. I've had a eufy and a roomba before and both had their faults however they at least vacuumed in a logical pattern and were capable of a spot clean without getting lost along the way. I would definitely replace it if my kids hadn't adopted it like some sort of strange pet and stop what they're doing to watch the poor thing ping pong about the house aimlessly and fail at its sole point of existence. On the plus side, I can use my arms again so I can sweep and use an actually functional vacuum to clean the whole house in less time than it takes this little dude to try and navigate our hallway.","Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,3,Squeaks incessantly after one month BUT still works after 1 year,"I ordered this robot vacuum and used it for about 4 weeks before it started to squeak incessantly. I was bummed bc I like the design of it, I like that it’s white, I like the app that allows you to schedule cleanings and send it back to charge. I thought it was better technology at making a space but it will vacuum about in the same area for an hour and revisit places it has already vacuumed. The first few uses it kept moving past the one area in the kitchen that really needed a vacuum but finally it did get to it. I find it amusing but can see how it would be annoying if you really wanted it to vacuum more systematically and lived in a home with more foot traffic. Overall though, one month of use is not acceptable. I live in a two bedroom apartment-maybe 1000sq feet? I don’t have any animals and it’s just me so there isn’t a lot of dirt to pick up from day to day. I contacted customer service and they said the problem was an easy fix. They sent a video that I think was in Chinese, I’m not sure. This is to say that I didn’t understand it but I did watch it and was able to pop out the front wheel and clean it to stop the squeak. I’m not sure that this is a long term fix so I will likely have to clean the wheel once a month. It’s not the worst thing in the world, but it does make me wonder about the quality of the product overall. I purchased this on a holiday sale so it was under $100. Had I spent upwards of $300, I think I’d be even more disappointed. I just hope the vacuum will last. I’ll be looking at eufy or another brand if this one stops working. UPDATE: I added a star for longevity and because after I cleaned the front wheel it stopped squeaking and hasn’t squeaked since. I’ve had it now for just under a year and I appreciate that it continues to work. The customer service also sent me new filters and brushes free of charge to compensate for the squeak. In the end, I’m glad I purchased it. I hope it will continue to work well.","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2023"

The battery doesn’t last as long and it doesn’t return to the charging station it just dies wherever it is. Unfortunately there is no replacement battery for this you have to buy one from a different company and then take the whole vacuum apart. I was going to recommend this to my friend because she was looking for one but I told her nevermind find something else.

Seriously was the best one I ever owned! Now all of a sudden it doesn’t seem to be sucking anything up. Instead it’s leaving piles of dirt/ dog hair around my house.

B08R9LK9K3,3,Great for dust and hair,"Rundown: Works well for hair and dust, only on hard flooring. The title mentions this item works for hard-floors, the description includes low pile carpeting. As a cat owner, I tested litter pickup in low pile carpeting and hard-food pickup on tile. It left behind mostly all litter and the brushes flung the food outward on the tile so none was picked up. The system is incredibly quiet, but has low suction - I couldn’t see a difference when using quiet or powerful modes in the app. However, the app was easy to navigate and features arranged rows, whereas most others in this price range only offer randomized. The bin, filter, and brushes are easy to clean and remove, it followed a schedule as set, and didn’t have any navigational issues - returning to its dock with ease and not destroying anything it gently bumped into. Ultimately. I was really impressed with the capabilities of this vacuum and the app, it just doesn’t work well for our household.","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,3,Not really worth it,First off it doesn’t find its way back to the charger! It will keep going until it die out somewhere so we have to go searching for it.

B08R9LK9K3,3,"It works sort of, and there's there's no app","Pros 1. Battery life 2. Picks up a lot of stuff, it has 3 suction modes and they're enough to clean my floors. Cons 1. The QR code on the unit points to an app that does not match the photos on amazon and the app has no options, it does not work at all. With no app all advertised functions are not available. 2. Runs into everything aggressively. 3. It searches 99 percent of the house running into everything aggressively before it finds the dock. 4. Auto mode is the only mode available and edge cleaning is extremely aggressive, it will go along the edges of all rooms 10 plus times per cleaning cycle while it should be cleaning the entire floor. 5. Sometimes cannot handle an elevation change in the floor, sometimes acts like a there's a barrier and will not enter a room but there's no barrier. With no app for iOS and no possibility for firmware updates, it's stuck at auto mode and it don't work well.","Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,3,UPDATED: It stopped working after a year of use,"I usually don’t leave reviews, but this one I had to. I’m very satisfied with the product! I have two cats and they lose a lot of fur during the day, so I love that I can schedule cleaning and start a cleaning without even being at home. I also love that the brushes are long, so they reach corners that the robot can’t get too close. Definitely recommend! UPDATE AFTER ONE YEAR OF USE: I'm changing my review because sadly the robot stopped working after a year of use. Initially, it started not returning to the base when the battery was about to die, and then it just stopped charging. I bought a new battery online and replaced the old one, but it still didn't work. I was really happy with my purchase, and I can't say that it wasn't worth it, but I don't want to buy a new robot every year. I'm sad it didn't last longer.","Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,3,Great For The Price,"Play Video Easy to use, love that it’s brushless, so carpets and even charging cords rarely get so stuck that you have to assist it. Usually pulls itself away. But quickly after the first week you’ll regret not getting a nicer one that has better area cleaning awareness. Robot favors the left. It randomly cleans, except around its charging station. Not the best sensor, often smacks into items and other times stays its distance to far from edges. EVEN that said, having a dog this was a game changer in loose hair control and helps. I won’t be getting rid of it anytime soon that’s for sure. I do wish they came with more filters. Or washable ones.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023"

B08R9LK9K3,3,"Unimpressed, huge waste of $$$","Compared to my previous Sharp robot cleaner, it fails in every category. If you have furniture, don't bother. It constantly gets stuck UNDER couches, kitchen cabinets, and furniture, where it will simply shut down. I don't run it when I'm not around to rescue it. The software most definitely DOES NOT navigate it around obstacles, as it bounces off of and into EVERYTHING. Most usually won't make the transition between a marble floor and a rug, and occasionally when it does, simply glosses over the rug leaving piles of hair and debris. It has no sense of where it has cleaned, routinely going back over a spot multiple times while leaving entire connected rooms untouched - the mapping shows huge gaps everywhere. It has a long-lasting battery life, though max suction mode cuts time to 1/3. Has developed an incessant high-pitched squeak that no amount of lubrication can relieve - very annoying!

However, i soon realized that if there is even the tiniest of obstacle on the floor, the little guy will get stuck up on it and freak out until you come manually help out.

Negatives: It seems completely random cleaning even when you choose how you want it to clean. IT can never or takes forever for it when you tell it to stop and return to the base. It is basically blind with this and needs assistance. It is always getting stuck on things or under the furniture. I used it for 45mins today and had to un-stick it 4 times. The driving function on the app is awful. Do I love it? No. Do I hate it? No. But is can be completely frustrating when in use, but the price point on it was great. It's not a $500 cleaner, so do not expect great things from it. But I does get the vacuuming done for you eventually.","Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2023"

It’s been reliable and worked pretty well but after over a year of using this vacuum, the battery seems to die in the middle of vacuuming. It was so much hassle having to pick up the robot and put it back to its charging station after it dies. I thought it was the battery until I tried replacing the batteries (because who wants to buy a new one in this economy??) and the vacuum still dies at exactly 50%.

It also did a pretty good job climbing my cat tree. I looked everywhere trying to find it one day, but I didn't think to check the side of a cat tree. I assume it thought the fur sitting at the top of the tree needed to be dealt with. It runs as long as it wants to. I'm not the boss of it.

It cleaned wonderful kept my apt dust free It was very helpful at the beginning but... I bought it on 9/27/23. By 9/24 stared noticing that it wasn't finishing the task like it did before. I love it and it help me so much, it worked with no issues I was so pleased with my robot we named it (Tongui) ; I programed to work, 1 time per day, 6 days a week, we don't have pets/ carpet, is a low traffic house 2 adults (no kids).

B08R9LK9K3,2,"Terrible, I hate it","This has to be the dumbest ""smart"" thing ever. It's supposed to map the house, yet can never find it's dock. Maybe half the times it runs, it just keeps going in a circle and trying to eat it's dock, which makes it nearly impossible for it to go back to if it even were capable of finding it. It's afraid of light on the floor from windows and avoids it. It's constantly getting stuck under the couch on one end that's maybe 1/4"" shorter than the other side it doesn't get stuck under. It got stuck almost falling down the basement steps. We have herding dogs, so we have dog hair. This things sole purpose is to collect tumbleweeds from under the couch, and around furniture legs where things like that tend to collect. It kinda does. Not having the roller is nice, not having to detangle hair out of it constantly, but this severely limits it's ability to get hair and surface dirt off rugs and if you happen to put it on carpet. The vacuum mouth is too far from the floor surface to really be useful on carpets/rugs. Our first robot was a cheaper black Eufy, I forget the model. It was not ""smart"" at all, it could detect solid walls, but had a bumper-face so it just gently tapped things then turned a random direction and rolled off that way instead. It found it's home far more often, and somehow missed hair balls less often. The dumber robot did a better job, go figure.","Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,2,Very disappointing suction. App manual controls don't seem to work. Meh.,"I bought this specifically to clean my pool table, because I'm lazy, and to clean my floors to boot. It does a halfway decent job on the pool table, but still leaves small bits of chalk dust on the cloth. On the floor? Next to useless. I say next to useless because it -does- pick up dog fur, but pretty much everything else it either just runs over and leaves behind or scatters. I didn't expect it to pick up the small chunk of cashew that was under the couch, but I did expect it to pick up anything small and extremely light. As an example, there was a small piece of popcorn ceiling on the floor (polystyrene, not asbestos) about the size of a grain of rice. Ran over it twice, didn't pick it up. Perhaps I got a dud, but I'm unwilling to exchange it for another one. My sample size of one says stay away.","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,2,Pretty good under perfect conditions,"As long as there are no cords on the floor, no area rugs that aren’t adhered to the floor, no stairs, and nothing too light to knock over this robot works well. It particularly fails whenever a power cord is anywhere on the floor so I have to make sure my cords are plugged in and run up the wall and out of the way. It’s knocked over a pretty substantial bowl of dog food and tends to fold my area rugs up and mash them into the corner of the room (sometimes getting stuck on top of the pile of rug). It ran itself off the stairs once so I now barricade the top of the stairs to run the vacuum in my living room. All that being said it is a decent value for the low price that it is. I connected it to Alexa so I can just say start cleaning. Also, I use the scheduling feature in the app for regular cleanings. My only gripe is that I really have to set up my house to accommodate the robot more than I would like to.","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,2,Not So Smart - No 5GHz Wifi Compatibility,"For the price this is definitely ok. The noise it makes is not annoying. It is kind of a humming noise. However with that being said if vacuuming a room in the front of the house we can hear it in the farthest room in the back of the house. So not something to try to run at night when sleeping. Also it's not the sharpest tool in the shed. It seems to be drawn to obstacles and it will vacuum over and over again around these obstacles like chair legs or table legs while vacuuming the wide open spaces maybe once. Also still can't get it hooked up to the wifi so we can use the app. Also we used a room divider to create a small simple area for it to vacuum and put the docking station in this area. It doesn't get stuff in the corners. But it just keeps vacuuming, we will see how long it goes and if it stops. So it looks like regardless of how big or small it will just keep vacuuming for the same length of time. Floors can't have electrical cords in its way they have to be off the floor for sure. Definitely put in each room and close the door and let it go. Use a stable room divider or something else if you want it vacuum a specific area. We paid $88 for it. Saw it went up to $99. In our opinion this is a good robot vacuum if you don't have a lot of money or have never had one and want to try one out. But if money is no obstacle definitely get the smartest one you can afford and is 5GHz compatible. This only works with 2.4 Ghz wifi.

Another issue is the patterns that it runs is strange, as you can see in the video it goes back and fourth only covering a small area, then goes all the way across the room and starts cleaning another area. Seems like its drunk or something. Another issue is that is really does nothing to clean the carpets, I mostly have Pergo and tile on the bottom floor, however my whole upstairs is carpet and this little unit has no suction to handle this. I will run this during the week, but on the weekends still need to break out the old Rainbow vacuum cleaner for a deep clean.

B08R9LK9K3,2,Just an okay vacuum,"I received this vacuum today and was very excited to get it plugged in and started with cleaning my living room (low pile carpet). After reconfiguring my internet to turn off the 5Ghz network, it took me SEVERAL attempts to get the device connected to the Lefant app (only the red one, not the green one that also comes up in the iPhone app store), but I DEFINITELY could not get it connected to Alexa, no matter what steps I tried. You have to download the Smart Life skill on your Alexa app, which I already have because I have other Smart Life devices, but the Smart Life app would not discover/recognize the vacuum. I tried searching the web for support on how to get it connected to Alexa and sadly there isn't anything out there on how to troubleshoot the vacuum or Smart Life app to help discover the vacuum. Personally, I didn't have a long time with it, but it has low suction and is probably best on hardwood floors and would recommend something with more suction power even for low pile carpet. When I turned mine on, it pretty much went straight to under my table and then would get stuck between the legs of the chairs, but when I redirected it back to my living room, it didn't take up much and I could tell it would required several run a day to get all the small crumbs my kids drop on the floor. I also bought the Lefant F1 and it at least has 4 options for suction vs this product (M210). The Lefant F1 at least provided vacuum lines as it was running.

B08R9LK9K3,2,"Disappointing experience, would’t recommend","I was initially excited about the lefant robot vacuum cleaner due to positive reviews, but my experience has been far from satisfactory. Connecting it to WiFi was a hassle, taking five attempts to establish a connection with persistent error messages. Once in action, the arranged cleaning mode proved inefficient – spending 15 minutes repeatedly covering the same area while missing spots with the most dirt. Even in a small 1-bedroom apartment, the vacuum struggled to navigate efficiently, leaving me frustrated as it failed to complete even half of a room in 30 minutes. What's worse, the battery drained significantly, down 5% after just 3 minutes of use, despite being charged overnight. Also, it NEVER found the dock, I had to manually place it on it after watching it struggle for a while. In hindsight, I could have accomplished more with a traditional sweep. Considering my experience, I would strongly advise against purchasing the lefant robot vacuum. If you're in the market for a reliable option, investing in an actual Roomba seems like a more sensible choice, in my opinion. I'll be returning the lefant without hesitation.","Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2023"

I have sent 2 emails and called. I haven't received any help from manufacturer! I haven't even had it for a year yet! Not happy!! I just purchased the m210 and I can not understand how to get it to do anything in a normal pattern. I guess that is ok, but it seems to always go to the same spots. Which is not good. I also can't figure out the remote! I am using my phone, but still the same issues! It would be nice if they actually gave you some kind of instructions of how to do something! I do believe it works well, this is my second day! But I can't seem to get it to go! And when I say go, I mean go other places. It wants to clean in the worse spots (under things) and stay there. Maybe I have a lot of dog hair there, but it can't be that smart?!?! If I can figure it out, I believe it will be a very good friend to have around! I named it Rosie lol like the Jetsons.... and if I could get Google or Alexia in on that?!?! As I said just very confusing!","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2021"
B08R9LK9K3,2,Decent affordable option,"Update - after using this for a few weeks, I wouldn't purchase it again. The battery dies very quickly, it doesn't map so it doesn't learn the layout of the space and needs a babysitter, and the most frustrating thing is that it can't ever find it's base to charge. I've been in touch with support and done everything recommended and it will be within 2 ft of the base and still can't find it. I purchased this on sale to keep the floors at the office clean, it works good for this purpose. I don't know how well it would work for a house with animals or a lot of traffic, since it JUST keeps up with this space. Also, I wouldn't say it's worth paying full price for, but for $99 it does its job. It's not something I would run unattended, since it can get caught on things. It also can't ever find its way back to the dock. I've followed all directions to correct this issue, but I still have to ""drive"" it back to the dock. The description also said it comes with a remote control, and it does not.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2022"

B08R9LK9K3,2,Not worth it,"When I first turned this thing on it went kind of haywire and ran into everything. It couldn't get over my rugs. I noticed the directions said you need to fold down all the corners of your rugs, pick up everything you own off the floor, set it to the direction you want it to clean. So unfortunately I don't have a lot of time for that. But I did it anyway and it tried its hardest bless its heart. I looked in the collection bin and it picked up almost none of the dog hair and for some reason it was saying a wheel had an obstruction but I couldn't find anything. The two bristles that spin around on the bottom do collect a lot of dog hair but they also fall off easily. Overall this thing is only great for going under the couch and bed, spots not easily reached. But the headache of having to monitor it isn't worth it to me.","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2022"

I had it set to standard suction, but the battery losses 15% of power before it’s even finished my 10x12 office. Heaven forbid it gets “stuck” in the middle of a cleaning. You have no way to track the vacuum. All you can do is click the button in the app to make it play a sound and then wander around until you find it. And don’t even try to have it finish the cleaning. It won’t. Once you find the stuck vacuum, it forgets that it has started cleaning and completely starts over.

(even though it's 100% charged, will only say 16%. And sometimes it says it can't connect and have to try multiple times) Only way to get it to completely work with app is to split the 2.4 and 5.0 SSID to different names, but that doesn't work for me.

It has done well on the hardwood floors and even handled the area rugs fine. A little noisier then the shark was but for the money can’t beat it. Been running twice a day for a few months problem free. Even come with extra filter and brushes. Update 2024, after having it for a while I wanted to update my review. It is the dumbest smart vacuum around. It will climb toys, dogs and furniture. The dust catcher has broken all the clips off. Has not held up as well as I expected. If you need a cheap robot vacuum that will not come to life and take over the plant (it is way to dumb) then this is a good choice.

It really looks like it cleans the carpets---great vacuum lines showing that it has covered everything, however, when you open the little holder, it picks up almost nothing. I shed hair like crazy and my corgi at least doubles that and there was nothing in the holder. Plus I didn't notice until I had it home that there are only the brushes that go in circles to pull stuff toward the suction--not the one that rotates under the vacuum that actually seems to do most of the cleaning and pick up in other vacuums. Most likely will be returning before my window closes.","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2023"

B08R9LK9K3,2,Pretty good-update review,"Update: after having three of these. I now have just one that works. The company being overseas is hard to be in contact. The replies are delayed and it takes months to resolve an issue. I had to change sensors on the vacuum and even after all the troubleshooting they could not get it to work. They did send a replacement, which was nice because it stopped working after less than 6 months. My other vaccum died after it failed to stop at a drop. I just think these have design flaws and do not last long. I would be weary buying them as now I have two duds that I will just add to the garbage heap-sad. Save your money and buy one that is known to be good from a reputable brand. They also, never found their way back to the charger or mapped the room. It helps clean and I like that, I move it around the house and it does a decent job. I find the app and remote hard to use. The instructions that came with it were not super helpful.

B08R9LK9K3,2,Stops working after a couple days.,"First off, the positive is that this came within hours, very quick delivery and good packaging. However; the app is horrible. It took me almost an hour to pair the device and honestly don’t like that it’s an app and not a remote. Once it was paired, I ran it. It did a decent job, but did not get everywhere or even close to everywhere which was annoying, but I just kept moving it as it missed a whole open area. Trying to manually move it on the app is a joke. It is frustrating so just pick it up and move it where you want t to. After about the 3rd time running it, it stopped picking up things and more pushed them around. Super disappointed but I guess you get what you pay for. Buyer beware. It also defeats the purpose. I have had other brands in the past and never had to watch them or redirect them all the time. I would rather just do it myself.","Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2022"

It get hung up on trying to cross over these. Sometimes making it across, other times turning around or just shutting down because it is stuck. I use in now solely on a level of my home that has no thresholds, and it performs well. Is also does not navigate well around light furniture, it in fact moves light chairs and dog beds around. **Update - after I placed my initial review of this vacuum, the company contacted me and wanted to give me a full refund for my purchase. They would give me half of the refund upfront and the other half of the refund if I deleted my initial rating and review and change it to a 5 star rating. My integrity cannot be bought.

B08R9LK9K3,2,Very basic,"I thought the description about the app and it “learning” the home layout meant it would actually be able to efficiently clean a room. Unfortunately, that is not the case. It repeatedly goes over the same areas multiple times without proceeding to the rest of the room. I tried using the “edge” option so it could get a full layout of the room, but it did not stick to the wall and continued in the center of the room. Not bad for a basic robot vacuum, but I already have one of those that’s ~8 years old. I thought this would be an upgrade, but it doesn’t do anything more than my old one does.

It picked up only half the usual dust, dirt and hair from our dog that the Roomba does. In the picture, the pile on the right is from the Lefant and the pile on the left is from the Roomba, which ran right after the Lefant finished vacuuming. I have mostly carpet, so perhaps if you have floors without carpet, the Lefant might work quite well. I'll be returning it because it didn't perform with my flat pile carpet.

B08R9LK9K3,1,Stopped Charging after using/charging only 3 times before.,"I cleaned a total of 11 rooms on three occasions. Did not use it for a while. When I tried again, it had not held the charge, nor would it charge up. I looked at the delivery date and it was about a week past return date. Am informing the company today 2/9/24. It arrived about Dec. 29-31. Otherwise, I will say I did not expect A-1 results or durability from this cheap machine, but thought I would be satisfied with it for a while. It does not come with electronic bariers to prevent it travelling into remote, continuously open room before running out of charge. (This results in needing to find ad hoc barriers to ensure it is getting over all the floor of a couple of rooms at a time). It does bump hard when it hits things. It broke the glass in a very large, heavy, framed picture that I used in combo with another sturdy item, by knocking over the picture. The way I placed the picture with the other item, the vacuum did not hit the glass directly. I thought the two items would proved sufficient resistance weight.) I would have much preferred to have barriers--why lug barriers around, if you have bought an electronic vacuum? -- that all the wireless phone gismos that I do not need. In any case, this vacuum should not be left unsupervised by a human. Do not let the presence of these features (also untested by me) persuade you toward buying this one. It does suck fairly well for a light-weight machine, though not as strongly as I think most would want it to. On the other hand, it gets stuck in repetitive small loops around the legs of furniture, it puts deep creases into the carpet pile there (average residential depth carpet) --yet they can be removed by rubbing with moderately strong pressue. Still, that many-times repetition burns through the electrical charge. The physical construction and design are pretty good. As I have had it for such a short time, I can not speak to the durablity of the cover, wheels, etc. It is easy to dump out the collector. It comes with two internal, fine filters plus one external filter-holder combo thing. The two fine filters are a good thing as the first fine filter was becoming clogged faster that I would have liked. The manual is ok, but very fine print.","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2024"

I do not have kids or anything that would damage the product beyond normal wear and tear usage. However I came home and noticed it was stuck in a rather odd area. Essentially nothing around it. After moving it and turning it back on the bot would bounce around as it It was hitting barriers. Upon further investigation It seems that a motor has seized and is causing the sensor in the device to perceive an obstruction, though non exists.....

In the area I am lucky enough for it to obsess over, it just goes over the same dirt without picking anything up. I even picked it up and moved it somewhere else and it went back there. It also doesn’t last even half the time it suggests it does, even brand new. Also didn’t find its way back to the base, it just died in place. If this was $20 it would be too much.

B08R9LK9K3,1,Update: Useless without remote.,"This is the 3rd one I’ve bought. One of the previous I stored without turning off the switch inside and the battery won’t take a charge. My fault. So I bought another a few months ago and just got to unboxing it now. I didn’t realize there was no remote with the newer versions. I am not hooking up to wifi. I’m getting disgusted with how many devices require internet to use. The old remotes turned it on to one setting only - random. Which is the worst setting. The perfect up and down systematic way the old ones cleaned is so much better. Previous review: I love it so much I bought 2. We have 3 dogs. I run this almost every night and the amount of hair it picks up is honestly disgusting. I use one for the house and bought a 2nd one for the basement and I’ve had them for almost 2 months. We have all hardwood floors and concrete in the basement and it’s just amazing how much it picks up and how well it handles different obstacles it comes across. Of course it does have limitations and I kind of think of him as a 3 year old helping me vacuum. He can’t escape power cords and sometimes gets stuck behind the couch, he can get around kitchen chairs but gets confused and I think it cleans better to just pick them and flip them onto the table. But if I don’t actually feel like moving anything out of the way I just set him loose and he bumps around whatever’s on the floor and finds his way. I’m seriously in love with how clean our floors have been and it keeps me motivated to keep clutter organized and out of the way. It’s also nice that I can do laundry or dishes or whatever and know another chore is getting done at the same time. I never bothered with wifi, just use the room and edges buttons on the remote. The fabric dust filter is easy to remove and rinse with water and it dries by the next day. Seriously if you’re fed up always having to sweep and vacuum you will never regret getting this.","Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2022"

Then the charging and nonstop beeping began. And I haven't been able to use it since then. I'm very disappointed because At first I loved this vacuum, it would get stuck on things and couldn't find it's way back to the charging station but it still picked up a lot of dog hair so the other stuff didn't bother me too much.

Once the vacuum was full charged I was ready to check it out in action. Started it and it backed off the charger, did a 180 turn and moved forward about two inches then stop and nothing. then power light went off.

After contacting customer service, all they could offer in the way of troubleshooting was a ""factory reset"" which was simply unplugging and replugging in the charging station, and turning off and on the device. When this yielded the same error, I was told the vacuum was defective and to contact Amazon for support. Initially I paid for a prime week-long trial to receive same day delivery, but the replacement is not due for 5 days.

When I tried using it again after that, the robot was completely out of charge and would not charged at all, it keeps giving me a charging error. At first I thought maybe it was my fault and I didn't fully charge it like I thought I did so the battery got damaged.

The height of the device itself is too tall to clean underneath common furniture. The app/device does not give a layout option “map” of your home, therefore bumping mindlessly into all furniture. No way to avoid a room, or STAIRS. The wheels are all terrain, so not only will it climb over obstacles but get stuck too. —This is very loud to hear the robot *attempt* to make its way out of a stuck position.

Very, very loud vacuum motor and self driving wheel motor. —When it’s docking and trying to locate its station (not vacuuming , the drive motor is loud and the machine will take a long time to find it’s place.

The only way I could get it to go through my apartment was to manually control it, which, at that point, it is easier for me to just use my normal vacuum. It also does not suck nearly as much as a normal vacuum even when I had it in the high suction setting. It is extremely not intuitive when it comes to getting back to its base as well. It would be right in front of it with no blockades and would literally turn around and go as far as possible in the opposite direction and start going against a wall over and over.

B08R9LK9K3,1,Does not last,"I really enjoyed the vacuum at first, I have a short haired dog who sheds year round so there’s always loose dog hair. The vacuum would pick it up well, Id run it daily and empty it daily. It was real helpful. However, it didn’t even last one year. Don’t know what happened, one day I came home It hadn’t returned to its charger and was completely unresponsive. I tried every measure of troubleshooting, but it was just completely dead. Charger still worked, as did the remote, but it as if the robot got fried somehow. It wasn’t tangled, there’s no loose water, and hardwood floors all around. Waste of money honestly for it to not even last a year. Side note: I had it living in a carpeted apartment then moved to a house. In the apartment it would do okay at picking up the surface hair, but not really suction below the surface.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2023"

We have 3 American Bulldogs and 1 long hair cat = A LOT of shedding, plus dirt and normal dust. The 2 vacuums dual over our living-dining-kitchen floors. 2 is better than one, right? Wrong! The Robit picks ups 100x more than the Lafant. They are both ran every day. The running time is considerable. The Lafant has ZERO suction power. I empty the other 3 times before I have to empty the Lafant once! Wish I had returned it. Wish I could have left a zero or negative star rating. ***Update: After several months of back and forth emails with the company, stating if I changed my review to favorable they would send a new vacuum, but I had to modify my review first, they they refunded half the purchase price.

I would not pay another $200 just so the robot could charge itself. I was okay with the thought of returning it to the charging station every time. If those were the only problem, okay. BUT the robot is USELESS. It does a terrible job mapping the place and just follows CHAOTIC PATTERNS, always returning to the same spots, and ALWAYS getting stuck. It just kicks the dirt around without actually sucking it. It's loud and takes FOREVER to ""clean"" the place (come on, it's a tiny one-bedroom apartment). At the end of the day, I rather stick to conventional vacuums that only take me 15 minutes to clean the entire apartment.","Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2023"

He listened to the BEEP sounds of the dying device, came to the same conclusion (that the battery is dead) and gave me an email address to write to and request a replacement. And guess what? They DID replied - and advised me to charge the battery for at least 5 hours. As if saying: ""Try flogging that dead horse for 5 hours, maybe he'll resurrect."" I kindly informed them that I've been trying recharging it for 5 not hours but days, with zero success. And then - crickets! They haven't contacted me back. And my warranty?

Which, of course, is ridiculous as there is a fan that would create suction behind the fill chamber as well as a 1"" height difference between the floor and chamber. It looks like some people like theirs, but mine was worthless.","Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2021"
B08R9LK9K3,1,Don’t recommend,Mine stopped working after 5 months for no reason. Didnt really pick up that much. I prefer the ones with a brush to help collect debris,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,1,Unfortunate purchase,"I’ve had this vacuum since March… barely used..its still pretty and looks just like New . Unfortunately it does not do the job it’s intended to do and for the price point it is very upsetting. The app is very useful and consumer, friendly, other than that I would not waste my time :(","Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,1,Should have returned,"It is great, I never have to empty the dust bin. Hopefully if you are thinking of buying this robot vacuum, you realize never needing to empty the bin is a problem. It is always clean because it does not pick up anything. I have had other robots and we have a dog and a cat, there is debris to pick up and other robots have a full bin every cleaning. I am fairly certain the quiet cleaning is due to little to no suction. Conclusion: do not go for this vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2023"

B08R9LK9K3,1,Waste of money,I didn’t have high hopes for a cheap robot vacuum and it was worse then I expected. It will not go over transition strips or clean even the thinnest area rugs.

B08R9LK9K3,1,You’re better off vacuuming,"This item does barely ok. Here’s the thing anything such as cords, throw rugs, animal toys, and such will cause this dang thing to get caught up.

B08R9LK9K3,1,Coming on at random times during the night!,"Literally right after the return window closed, this thing started running at random hours during the night. I see someone else left a review with the same problem. Someone has clearly hacked into the app and controlling the vacuum from there. Will be turning off for good and contacting the manufacturer! 4 star deduction for this piece of garbage! Edit to add...was contacted by Le'fant on the 6th after they read my review. They offered to send a new machine which I agreed to but after sending them my address they then changed and said I needed to change what I wrote here first, then they'd send it.

B08R9LK9K3,5,I'm surprised.,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much but I'm very surprised. A deal breaker for me was not needing to connect to WiFi. I posted a question and received different responses, there was no user manual on their website or Amazon. Thankfully, you do not need WiFi to operate this. Hopefully yours is the same but I just put it in the corner of the room with the charger, hit the power button and away it went! It's unbelievably smart, it knows how to get every single corner and crevice. It seems like it actually goes back to certain areas because it was unsure. I think if you push the power button in different ways it will change the operating settings but I'm not sure and again, no specific info regarding that on the documentation. I do know if you push the power button twice it will activate ""return"" mode and will go back to the charger. It also will automatically go back to the charger if the battery is low. I'm amazed. I run it every couple days and it gets 20% full every time. Hopefully if I keep up with the maintenance it will last awhile. It is one of the cheaper robot vacuums on the market so I think that's the caveat, it doesn't last very long.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,5,It works even on dog hair,This is a fairly simple vacuum that I don't have to struggle with tech instructions to use. Works good even on dog hair.

B08R9LK9K3,5,Incredible Bargain: A Durable Workhorse That Exceeds Expectations,"What a Great Unit! I snagged this on Prime Days, and it turned out to be an incredible bargain. This thing is truly a workhorse! I’ve had it for about six months now, and I run it multiple times a day without any issues. The performance has been nothing short of impressive—it shows no signs of slowing down or letting up, which speaks volumes about its durability and quality. While it’s true that you have to replace the ""consumables"" from time to time, that’s a normal expectation with any high-performing unit. The replacement process is straightforward and doesn’t detract from my overall experience. I appreciate how easy it is to maintain, which allows me to focus on getting the job done instead of worrying about the equipment. Overall, I’m very happy with this purchase. It has exceeded my expectations in terms of functionality and reliability. If you’re looking for a durable and efficient solution that can handle daily use, I highly recommend this unit.

B08R9LK9K3,5,Works wonderfully,"I bought this on sale. I am so glad I did. It's worth every penny. I've probably had it close to a month now. I let it run around every morning. When the battery gets low, it finds it way back to its charging base just like it should. It has never failed to return to its base. Mine runs about 87 minutes before returning to its base. That is on low pile carpet mostly. I feel like if it only had hardwood or tile floors to run on, I'd probably get closer to the 120 minutes per charge. But it really does a fantastic job. I have one small dog. Running this cleaner every morning keeps my floors clean. Now, when I run my big upright vacuum, I hardly pick up anything at all with it.","Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,5,1 month so far - Easy to use,"Here are my thoughts after using it for a few weeks: **Design and Setup**: The Lefant vacuum boasts a sleek and compact design, allowing it to maneuver easily under furniture, under beds, and into tight corners. Setting it up was a breeze—just charge it, connect it to my Wi-Fi, and download the app to control it from my smartphone. The app is user-friendly, offering various cleaning modes and scheduling options. **Performance**: In terms of cleaning performance, I’ve been quite impressed. It picks up everything from dust to pet hair with ease. The suction power is adequate for everyday messes, and it automatically adjusts when switching between different floor types, which is a nice touch. I do notice that it can struggle a bit with larger debris, but for general cleaning, it does a great job. The top bin removal is nice and makes throwing out the debris easy while keeping the vacuum charging. This model is excellent, but a little small, so best for smaller room footprint. Each cycle is about 80 mins and then recharges for about 3 hours. Overall highly recommend for the price.","Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2024"

Hard linoleum floors, and multiple rugs (the thin kind you can toss in the washing machine). The cat sheds a lot and makes a mess with the litter of course. I was vacuuming 1 time per week bc that is what my schedule allows for, but by the end of the week the furr ball dust bunnies and the litter tracked all over the house was just awful. I turn on the robot every day or every other day and it keeps my floors feeling clean to walk on! Sometimes it will miss a closet or miss one of the bed rooms when cleaning before it runs out of battery. I keep it in my bed room to ensure it always cleans my room.

The only thing is, I’ve seen people talk about the feature where it can go back to its own charging port, and I have not been able to succeed at that. I am always amazed at how much it manages to pick up. I think my house is a very clean space, but this proves me wrong that little things are always brought into the carpets, etc..","Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2024"

It holds a fair amount in the canister. It really does need to be emptied after every floor cleaning. It isn’t very loud. We can easily watch tv while it’s running. The navigation seems pretty good. It did get “stuck” behind the couch when it was first trying to map out the house and needed to get back to its charging base. I gave it a push to get around the edge of the couch and it made it back to the base. Hasn’t had a problem with that since. It does get caught on the edges of my thicker rugs sometimes, but that seems to be the only recurring issue.","Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2024"

I have a dog that sheds hair all over and it's picked up when I get home. The appearance is nice. The noise is not so bad. The navigation is not the best as it can get stuck at my refrigerator. But for the value for the money, it's great! Connectivity with the app is fast.","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,5,Simply: Does its job.,"I’ve had the m210 for about 2 weeks now. I run it close to everyday. Honestly, it’s pretty great. It does exactly what I wanted it to do- maitenance cleaning. If you start with a relatively clean floor (as in you had already not been living in filth) it will maintain that. I couldn’t believe how much it picked up on its first go, and even subsequent rounds just a day later. Pros: -setup and control are very easy. I can’t figure out what all the negative reviews on this point are about. (?) -suction, cleaning are damn good. The floor is spotless after it runs. -the low profile sweepers extend out a bit from the body of the device which are great for reaching under the oven or gaps in the floor trim that are otherwise essentially un reachable. -great for areas I’m not going to sweep regularly like under beds/certain furniture -I’ve never had it get stuck or have any issues… the thing is like a tank going over small obstacles. Cons: -(this may apply to all robot vacuums).. if you pick it up and move it at all while in operation it doesn’t know how to compute its whereabouts. -battery is OK. Mine cleans 90sq meters in about 80 minutes and drains to about 10% battery. I suppose this is fine though, as that’s a full job. No reason to continue. I do also have a lot of obstacles and things it needs to go around. I imagine in larger open areas it would cover much more ground per battery %. -it’s not “loud” but it’s also not quiet. The noise level doesn’t bother me, especially since it’s a constant sound. But depending on your situation this may be something to consider. -I wish it would learn from each subsequent cleaning. Example: I have a long hallway and it still insists on cleaning it by going back and forth along the short width of the hallway, zig zagging slowly down. instead of making 3-4 long sweeps. Things like this don’t help the battery as it ends up doing so much more work turning around and all. ^this may not be a “thing”, or may be due to this being a basic model. I can’t imagine a $400 roomba wouldn’t have some type of smart learning feature. But whatever. I havnt messed around with schedules or different cleaning modes yet. All in all for the price this thing is perfect. I only break out the vacuum or broom for spot cleaning when needed. Use this semi daily with mopping when appropriate and your floors are gtg.","Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,5,So glad I didn’t splurge on a roomba,"I had been wanting a roomba for a while to help keep up with dog hair and crumbs my toddlers drop on the floor but I could never get behind the price. I ended up buying this and I’m so glad I did. It works really well, the battery lasts a couple of hours, and it’s pretty good at getting itself unstuck from random objects. I will say, it can sometimes miss patches of my kitchen before leaving it and it can’t pick up bigger pieces. I think there might be a manual navigation option in the app but I haven’t tried it so maybe that’s a user error on my part. But overall it’s a great machine. The container is easy to empty and it finds its way back to its charging station 95% of the time. Definitely recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2024"

For $88, don’t expect perfection, it does miss some spot cleanup, but it’s easy to setup, the app is functional, & the dust bin holds a decent amount of dog hair before I need to dump it.

B08R9LK9K3,4,"Works well, app compatibility is an issue I was aware of","It runs really well, great suction, lasts long enough to cover the 4 rooms I need it for. It's also fairly quiet and has no trouble going from the hardwood to the throw rug. The app isn't compatible with my internet so I just push the button to get it going and when it cries out that it's ready to go home, I fetch it and put it in front of the charging pad and it coasts right in. I'd read about the app issue and could not speak to how it is (someone else mentioned reprogramming their wifi but I'm not trying all that) but it still works well without it. Now for the problem over which it has no control so I didn't dock it any stars. I got it because I have two young cats, and was concerned the bigger one, who tends to be more timid, would be scared of it. Nope! She and her twin sister immediately starting bothering the robot so much, I had to physically move them so it wouldn't just be going in circles. The sensors are really good, so as they keep getting in front of it, it will just spin around to avoid them. They pester the poor robot to the extent that I have to pick it up periodically and put it in another spot for it to really make progress. The big twin is actually the worst, and has learned how to turn it on by hitting the button on top. Usually, they just block it from coming out until it gives up and goes back home. Essentially, not at all what I expected but better than them feeling terrorized by a scary robot. It works great when they let it, maneuvers most of the house well (has trouble with one divisor strip that is a bit thick), compacts all the pet hair and dust, and lasts a long time. Also wears the cats out for a long, quiet, peaceful nap afterwards. So glad I got this!","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

I am always shocked when I go to clean it out after one cleaning how much dust and junk is in there, and I run it every day. I bought this robovac three months ago. The longest it has lasted for a clean was 84 minutes at the beginning. It now lasts about 75 minutes. At 15% charge, it would go back and find the dock. Now THREE MONTHS later, it's not going back to its dock anymore. While cleaning, it just stops where it's at with no warning/low battery beeps. Something is wrong with the battery and I'm not very happy with that after just three months. I have emailed the company just today and am waiting to see if they respond with a solution.

B08R9LK9K3,4,Circular layouts confuse it.,"I love in an old house with uneven floors and different kinds of floors, stairs, and low pile rugs. The layout is an 8 shape but we keep the door that completes the bottom loop closed so the robot sees like a 9 shape. I had to start limiting it to just our high traffic areas because it would go over the same spots over and over again. It would seem to be under our love seat for 30 mins... So then it would run out of battery before finishing the whole layout. So now robot is limited to the kitchen/laundry/bathroom but it works well for that. It still seems to get confused if things aren't in the same place every day so I do have to get up to make sure nothing is in it's way before it runs but generally I'd say it helps a lot. I certainly clean out the catch often enough, 2 cats and my boyfriend in the kitchen certainly make a lot of mess so it is DEFINITELY helping. I normally run it in powerful mode. I will say that the app controls are a little disappointing. The manual control does not seem to work at all, I'll send it in one direction and then it won't let me change direction at all. Not really sure the benefit of the ""random"" path finding function.

I recommend you DONT get any apps or other BS to run paths etc. It's actually super easy to work. Just assemble brushes, put on charger. Once charged you literally just click the power button and it takes off and does its job! Works fantastic on dog hair, I don't have any carpet, just a few rugs. Not great with all the dirt, but fantastic for pet hair and why I bought one. I run it once a day, push button and it runs its course then goes back to charging station when battery is low. HIGHLY RECOMMEND was under $100 when I bought it and certainly put preforms the expensive models. Great buy just wish is was not so loud.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,4,Works good on dog hair,"My first time using it after charging overnight, the run time was about 90 minutes. It still showed 17% charge. The dust bin was full so I felt satisfied with the way it worked. I have 2 shedding dogs with tile and lamanent flooring. I bought this because it was a good sale price. I plan to use it daily. I do think it's noisy. I'm comparing it to a model my friend has when I say that. Suction was excellent so maybe that is part of the noise. I pushed the button twice to stop cleaning but it didn't seem to know how to find the charging station to return to. Eventually I picked it up and cleaned it before returning for charging anyway. Perhaps next time I'll figure out what went wrong.","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,4,It’s great when it’s working.,I really like this vacuum. I foster dogs and this vacuum has made it so I don’t have to lug a big shop vac into the dog room multiple times a day. It however did stop working after having it for 3 months. I reached out to the company and they have been very helpful and wanted to send out a new battery. But i would have to replace it myself and I’m not super handy. I mentioned that and they said that they would replace the machine.

B08R9LK9K3,4,Great vacuum for the price,This is my third vacuum from this company. I have chose this vacuum over many other brands. I have one for multiple areas of my home and have recommended this product to friends and family. The features of mapping your rooms and scheduling when to clean are great.

The company is mailing us a brand new vaccuum free of charge. Again, very impressed with the customer service! We didn’t pay very much and it worked ok for a bit, but just stopped working after several months. The battery says it’s fully charged, but it runs in circles for a few minutes and then dies. The online support is for connecting it to your phone, which is easy to do. Unfortunately, it was a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,4,Great for the price,"Given how low the price is, it actually works wonderful. I use mine daily for the past 6 months and it still works just as good as it did on day one. PROS: •great for pet hair, lint, dust, allergens. It fills the compartment completely even when I didn’t think I had that much on my floors. •app includes manual control. If I want it to work in a different room I can use my phone to manually drive it over to where I want, then reactivate cleaning mode. •Great price. I spent under $100 for mine and so far I have no regrets. •Scheduling! The app allows you to schedule when you would like it to activate. CONS: •Struggles with larger crumbs. I don’t use mine as a replacement for vacuuming, so it struggling to pick up a Cheeto is fine for me. I have children with allergies and I have two cats, so my primary use for this device is a daily pet dander cleaner in between me vacuuming. It does a wonderful job at collecting cat hair. •Battery life. I wish it was a tad bit longer. It lasts about 40-60 min. The good news is, when it needs recharging it drives itself to the charger. So it doesn’t just die wherever it happens to be. OVERALL: I recommend it. I’m a big fan of saving money where I can, and this device is one of those things that you can save money on and still receive something of quality.","Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,4,Convenient but Flawed: A Lifesaver for Pet Owners,"Updated to 4 stars, as Customer Services is really great. I recently purchased the Lefant robot vacuum, and overall, my experience has been mixed. **Setup and Delivery:** Setup was a breeze, and delivery was impressively fast. **Performance:** Initially, the vacuum followed a somewhat random pattern, which was disappointing. However, after moving the charging station to a more open space, I noticed a significant improvement in its cleaning pattern. It now follows a more systematic path, which is great. **Battery Life:** One major drawback is the battery life. It tends to die quickly, often before completing a cleaning session. I've had instances where the battery drained completely, likely because the vacuum got stuck and used up a lot of power trying to free itself. After rearranging some furniture, it no longer gets stuck as frequently. **Scheduled Cleaning:** I love the scheduled cleaning feature. It's incredibly convenient to have the vacuum clean while I sleep, making mornings a bit easier. **Pet Hair Management:** The main reason I bought this robot vacuum is because I have a Labrador Retriever, and managing daily dog hair on the floors was driving me crazy. Running the robot vacuum nightly has given me back my sanity, significantly reducing the amount of pet hair around the house. **Pet Interaction:** One downside is that my dog absolutely hates it, which can be a bit of a hassle. **Cost:** Originally priced at $199, I got it for $88 on Prime Day. Considering how much I paid for the convenience of not sweeping dog hair daily, I feel like $88 was a steal, especially knowing that these vacuums run upward of $400. Regardless of the battery issues I’d buy this one again (on the next Prime day 😂) Overall, while there are some areas for improvement, such as battery life and navigation, the Lefant robot vacuum still manages to be a helpful addition to my household cleaning routine.","Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,4,toddler loves to turn it on and clean it out,"I'm a working mom, so this helps to clean up the millions of crumbs my toddler leaves behind. My toddler calls it the Robot and has fun turning it on and cleaning out the compartment that collects all the stuff from the floor. I couldn't find it the other day, as it got lost in the house. I used the app that comes with it. The app can make the robot vaccum make a loud noise so you can find it. It was under my son's bed, stuck and struggling to get out. SO the app allows me to manually control the direction of the robot vaccum. My only complaint is that when it dies, it doesn't really know how to get back ""home"" to its charger like it's supposed to. I've had it for 2-3 months, and I've only seen it get back to its charger on its own maybe 2 times. It goes in random directions trying to find the charger. I'm not sure if I am supposed to train it to do that.","Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,4,Hair and stringy rugs,"This thing does okay so far does it make too much noise I haven't successfully been able to map the house yet. I am on the first test run and the first test run I noticed that rugs that are stringy and hair or it's arch enemy and then it dies. I'll update again as I tested out and see how it goes but so far doesn't seem so promising but who knows maybe it's just the first round. -3 stars Updated 7-24-2024 Now that I have tested some other robovacs I realize this is not the smartest back this runs into things constantly and it doesn't understand to stop. It keeps on trying to suck up wires stranger things to the point that it doesn't work anymore and then it needs help and get stuck. This vacuum is cheap it works but you have to make sure all the obstacles are out of its way including any stray power cables. I can't really recommend this one very well after I tried some other ones but it's very cheap and it got it on Prime Day for about $85 but I also got a i-Roomba for about $120 that I haven't tested yet but I have tested other ones and this one is like the bottom tier so far. So for a couple more dollars you getting more sense of mind and laziness. -1 star Undated 7-25-:2024 Change my mind I just received the iRoomba 692, a brand name robovac... It costs more and it does less than this one. So I have to rechange my review based on the pricing which is $85 versus $120 for brand name on Prime Day. Even though it sucks compared to the more expensive one I came to the conclusion that this is a low tier robovac but even though it's a low tier robovac it's better than the low tier of robovac of a brand name robovac. My recommendation is still do not buy this but if you buy any of the low tier robovac this one so far, of the ones I tried is better than the other ones in the low tier quality. In the world of the lower tier robovac this is in the -4+ stars If you have the money buy the higher tier one you'll see a world of difference and it is well worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,4,Like it,"I purchased this vacuum because my daughter recently started crawling and I didn’t want to have to sweep the floors 24/7, so I purchased this one. It had good reviews and I belive it connects to alexia. It does a pretty good job cleaning crumbs off the floor. The sensor is alright, it bumps into objects so it knows not to hit it again when it does by it. Noise level I would give it 5/10. The noise is there but it’s not too terrible. It’s super easy to clean out and use. It comes with an extra filter and sweep brushes whatever you want to call them. Mapping the house does a decent job. It does good on carpet. When it dies, it has a hard time finding the charger which is annoying. Sometimes it goes straight to it and others it just wonders wherever. But overall I like it. Would recommend!

B08R9LK9K3,4,I now understand why the price was so low.,"Update: The company reached out to me and apologized for all the errors my vacuum had. They said they would sent the information to their team and have the issues worked out. They also offered me a full refund and let me keep the product which I think speaks volumes about how seriously they take customer satisfaction. Yes the vacuum has some kinks but I would give this company another try just based off their costumer service. This is…yikes. You get what you pay for. Issues started right way. They sent the wrong directions with the vacuum and I was only able to set it up thanks to a YouTube video. Even then, set up was difficult and took me awhile. There were issues with the robot finding the internet network. Secondly, this doesn’t “map your house.” I have been trying to use the ‘arranged’ function and it spins in circles for 5 minutes and then attempts to line sweep the house but turns randomly every 10 seconds even if there’s nothing in its way. Thirdly, it started squeaking after 3 days. 🥴 I will say it’s very cheap and it does eventually get the living room and kitchen done but that’s about it. It can’t seem to find my hallway. My house is only 1,100 square feet and it takes about 1.5 hours (the whole battery life) to clean those two rooms. It finds the dock and charges fine, surprisingly.","Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,4,Battery life concern,"We purchased this robot vac last week and have used it about four times. We are confining it to about a 1,000 sq ft area of the house - all hard floors and a few low-pile area rugs. For the price, I think I’m happy with it, but I wonder about the battery life and whether we should go with a different model. I have noticed that even after a full charge, the vacuum can’t finish all of our area without getting down to the 15% mark (at which point it stops vacuuming and makes it way back to its base). I’m curious if we need to use it in a different mode (we’re using standard mode). Going to try a few more days before we return it. I have heard positive things about Lefant customer service and am hopeful we can get some support with this issue (or if there’s a recommendation for a different model from this company that might do better in terms of battery life for a larger space).","Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2024"

I knew it was not the top brand but i just wanted something to pick up the animal hair during the week in between real cleanings. About two weeks in 1 wheel stops working and all it does is spin in a circle. There is nothing jammed and I can move the wheel myself and of course it was the same time that the return window closed.

Harry will happily clean every inch. He has willingly (and successfully) vacuumed a loose shag rug as well as a high density, high pile shag rug. He even tried to go through the slider to do the sun room(don't worry, I saved him). He's dedicated, determined, and has a superior work ethic. I'm not sure about navigation as I've never paid attention while he's working. I was slightly concerned that he waited until 8-10% battery before heading home after a long days work, but he's made it safe and sound after each shift. I love the app, which connected seamlessly.

They were reaching out to try to make things right, as my previous review was brutally honest. I received an option for a full refund or to receive a replacement at no charge. The email was kind and apologetic, only focused on how to make things right. To be honest, I was outside of the refund period, and had succumbed to just being out he money I spent. It is refreshing to know a company still cares about their customers and will take care of problems that arise. I have changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars because the company is willing to do what is right. They have noted that problems I noted will be addressed by their team to correct the issues. Previous post for reference: This vacuum worked fine for a couple weeks on a daily schedule, but after the couple weeks would beep incessantly while charging. The beeps would occur every five minutes, with a cadence and beep count that could not be found in any troubleshooting documentation. I finally turned off the power and stopped using it out of frustration. Upon attempting to restart, the unit will turn on but will not work or respond to the button. So disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,4,Mo gets the job done.,"Bought this over a year ago and we are still going strong...we named our vacuum ""Mo"" from the movie Wall-E. Because it seems like he is always trying to clean in areas not needed 🤦‍♀️. Mo does not have a specific pattern per say. He kind of just goes everywhere and then when his battery is low he wonders around the house trying to find his home. We typically feel bad for him and just carry him back to his spot. Downsides: no alert when holder is full, we have dogs and so pet hair is an obvious, no alert is annoying and results in us chasing Mo around to empty him. Not going to clean carpets at all, although will pick up bigger items, but if you're expecting it to clean the hair out, it won't. Will sometimes get hyper focused on one area, like our chair ... we have to move Mo onto another section because he will just keep running into the chair. Will sometimes yeet himself off the stairs, it only happened a couple times, I think he learned his lesson though because he hasn't done it in some time now. The app is not always user friendly, tried to use the ""map my house"" part and it worked a couple times and then just stopped. Upside- it is a cheaper robot vacuum and still going strong after a year Replacement parts are not horribly priced. Does a good job cleaning the floors and does try to get in all the areas of the house.","Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,4,"It does a good job on flat surfaces, not too good on carpet.","This robot vacuum has been a fantastic addition to my cleaning routine. One of its best features is the ability to schedule cleaning times. Waking up to a clean floor and returning home to one, especially with a Cane Corso at home, is truly a delight. Its sturdy design gives me confidence that this beauty will last a long time. I particularly appreciate the adjustable ""obstacle avoidance sensitivity,"" which helps prevent damage to walls and furniture. The battery life is impressive, easily allowing it to clean my entire first floor, including the kitchen, living room, and dining room. However, there are a couple of drawbacks. The suction power on carpet could be stronger, and it doesn't save the floor map, which means it might miss spots occasionally. I've also noticed that even in ""powerful mode,"" some hair is left on the carpet. Despite these minor issues, this robot vacuum serves its purpose well and saves me a lot of manual sweeping.","Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,4,Love it,I love this little guy..he works great but the only downfall so far is that I can’t get the setup correctly. For this to work you need a certain internet g to connect to program this vacuum. I have had no luck but I just run it and let it do its thing. It cleans up everything and does a great job but if you can’t program it then it misses stuff but it does get real good next to hard to reach corners when it goes in a straight line.

B08R9LK9K3,4,Pushes Hair Around,"I'm not new to buying these little robots. This one I bought because of the *Smart* feature. Which most days it does go line to line. However, it does not run on the times I've requested on the app. Nor is it *Picking* up the hair. It's pushing it around into balls and it will get stuck in a ball under the machine. Very little actually gets up into the machine. Guess the positive is that you rarely have to dump it. But on the opposite end, you have to constantly pick it up, flip it over and clear the bottom of hair. While also going around picking up hair balls on the floors.

B08R9LK9K3,4,Good dumb vaccum,"I am loving this vacuum, but there is a few major flaws. I purchased this on sale so for $88 it was completely worth it. The amount of dirt and hair this thing picks up is unbelievable. He is my new favorite coworker, I set him in the main rooms and let him do his thing. He will stumble in the other rooms and I will shut the door so he can clean the whole room since he really doesn’t have a memory function. I have not had luck having any map saved. It does whatever it wants really, doesn’t have a rhyme or reason. It’s hard to get it to go to the dock if it’s not in the same room. But that’s ok, cause I manually drive it back and it’ll park itself usually when in the same room. For the money it is worth it for the ease and amount of hair and dirt it picks up. But it does need babysat, don’t trust it to clean your whole house and return home with you not there to babysit or guide it. Other than that it works great. I bought two. I mainly plan on using them just for select rooms, so it works for what I need it for.","Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,3,"Poor suction, worse app","Pros: easy to get set up and get started. Very straightforward dust bin cleaning. Much cheaper than other alternatives. Cons: the app doesn't work with 5g wifi networks, and the amazon description doesn't say this anywhere. You can use the vacuum in its basic mode without the app, and can order a separate remote for 15 bucks, but not working with 5g wifi is just inexplicable, and greatly reduces the selling points of this vacuum. Also, it just doesn't have great suction. I have terrazzo floors - probably the easiest to clean of any floor out there - and the vacuum left quite a bit of sand/dirt. It also just refused to get onto my low-pile bathroom rug despite claiming a much higher clearance capability. Just not worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,3,It’s ok,"Pros: easy to control from the app, easy to empty, quieter than most robot vacuums. What I do not like about this product is that it does not pick up enough.

B08R9LK9K3,3,App development could use work,"I have had this for robot for about 2 months now. It’s been great in minimizing clean up with 2 animals that shed all year round. The reason for the lower review is mainly the app development. For the most part everything works perfectly fine. There are some things I wish were better or changed. For starters I wish the robot went back to the charger before it dies. Every time I come home it’s smack dead in the middle of the floor and I have to take it back to its hub. Secondly please develop a way to set designated “No Go” areas. It’s very frustrating when I’m watching tv and it has found a way behind my tv stand eating my cords and unplugging things. The sensitivity just isn’t enough. Also saving a map of your home instead of recreating one every time on start up. Everything else is great. I love the timers and the quiet and powerful settings. All in all, good cheap alternative to see if you want to buy a roomba but definitely not a long term household cleaning tool","Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,3,Works in the barest sense of the word,"I purchased this while recovering from surgery and couldn't use my arms and thus the regular vacuum. It's better than nothing but the poor thing wanders around in the most random patterns and appears to specifically avoid dust, dirt, and crumbs on the floor so I always have to sweep before or after to have an actually clean floor. It can get from the wood floor in the hallway into my sons' rooms without issue but has to be physically lifted and placed to get into my bedroom with exactly the same carpeting which kind of defeated the purpose of having purchased it because I wasn't supposed to be using my arms to lift anything including this relatively light vacuum. I'm surprised to find there's ever anything actually in the canister to empty and suspect it's slightly better on carpet than wood floors where the brushes just shoot things around rather than into the path of the vacuum. I've had a eufy and a roomba before and both had their faults however they at least vacuumed in a logical pattern and were capable of a spot clean without getting lost along the way. I would definitely replace it if my kids hadn't adopted it like some sort of strange pet and stop what they're doing to watch the poor thing ping pong about the house aimlessly and fail at its sole point of existence. On the plus side, I can use my arms again so I can sweep and use an actually functional vacuum to clean the whole house in less time than it takes this little dude to try and navigate our hallway.","Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,3,Good Concept but Needs Improvements in Performance and Usability,"The Lefant Robot Vacuum Cleaner has some great features, but it falls short in a few key areas. While it does have strong suction and a decent runtime of 120 minutes, I found that it needs more suction power to effectively pick up debris, especially on carpets. It struggles with larger particles and tends to miss spots, which can be frustrating. Another downside is its object detection capabilities. The robot sometimes gets confused and bumps into furniture instead of navigating around it, leading to inefficient cleaning. It would greatly benefit from improved sensors to better detect objects and avoid obstacles. I also wish it had programmable areas, allowing me to designate specific rooms or zones for cleaning. It can be inconvenient to have to place objects in the middle of rooms to prevent it from going where I don’t want it to clean. Overall, while the Lefant Robot Vacuum has potential, it needs enhancements in suction power, object detection, and programmability to make it a truly effective cleaning solution.","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,3,I loved it until it crashed.,"We’ve had this robot for a little over a year and a half, got it while it was on sale. This vacuum always shocked me on how much dust/dirt it picked up. Cleaning was easy compared to all these other vacuums out there now a days. It doesn’t have all the bells and whistles but that’s just more things to clean at the end of the day. I ran this vacuum almost every single day. I tried to program it to a schedule but was never successful in that area. It would just start at random times. But let me stress again, it was on sale, really great price so it was worth the gamble. The app was never worth it for me. Battery life was ok. I feel like it got majority of my main living areas before dying. It would take awhile to find its base. Came with replacement parts and extra filter. One day I went to turn it on, it cleaned for about 2 minutes then crashed. I have checked to make sure it was getting a proper charge. It does the same thing every time I try to use it. I guess it’s finally to part with it. I really do miss it now that I don’t have it to use daily. Nothing is made to last these days anymore though.

B08R9LK9K3,3,Great for dust and hair,"Rundown: Works well for hair and dust, only on hard flooring. The title mentions this item works for hard-floors, the description includes low pile carpeting. As a cat owner, I tested litter pickup in low pile carpeting and hard-food pickup on tile. It left behind mostly all litter and the brushes flung the food outward on the tile so none was picked up. The system is incredibly quiet, but has low suction - I couldn’t see a difference when using quiet or powerful modes in the app. However, the app was easy to navigate and features arranged rows, whereas most others in this price range only offer randomized. The bin, filter, and brushes are easy to clean and remove, it followed a schedule as set, and didn’t have any navigational issues - returning to its dock with ease and not destroying anything it gently bumped into. Ultimately. I was really impressed with the capabilities of this vacuum and the app, it just doesn’t work well for our household.","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2023"

B08R9LK9K3,3,Lots of pros and cons,"This is my first robot vacuum I've ever owned. We affectionately named him Victor. I got him to control the amount of pet hair I have on my floors. Pros: At first, it works amazingly!! My floors had never been so dog hair and crumb free. There is an app to control it. So convenient. Very quiet when compared to traditional vacuum. My young daughter hates loud noises but loves ""Victor."" Looks very nice. Love the white color. Can navigate itself back to the charger when battery is low. Relatively easy to empty the dirt out and clean filter. Cons: Does not avoid some things it should. If you have pets - this thing will run right over dog pee, poop, throw up, water slobber after they drink water, wet food dropped on the floor. You really have to make sure your floors are CLEAN before you run this, and basically monitor the whole time if you have pets that may have an accident. Or if someone spills something. It is HORRIBLE to clean this if it runs over something it shouldnt. Eventually, as you can see by the video above, it starts just stalling in one spot. It moves slightly, then stalls in one spot again. For reference, I bought this in 06/2023 and it is now 08/2023. 2 months before it became faulty. If you have children, like me, they might become attached to it, now i feel bad if I have to get something new. My 4 year old is always asking ""what's wrong with Victor""? Overall, I probably wouldn't buy this again since I know it stops working. If it continued to work the way it did when I first bought it, it would be one of the best purchases I've ever made. Although, if you have kids who spill things, dogs who sometimes have accidents, etc. This might not be for you.","Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2023"

B08R9LK9K3,3,Squeaks incessantly after one month BUT still works after 1 year,"Play Video I ordered this robot vacuum and used it for about 4 weeks before it started to squeak incessantly. I was bummed bc I like the design of it, I like that it’s white, I like the app that allows you to schedule cleanings and send it back to charge. I thought it was better technology at making a space but it will vacuum about in the same area for an hour and revisit places it has already vacuumed. The first few uses it kept moving past the one area in the kitchen that really needed a vacuum but finally it did get to it. I find it amusing but can see how it would be annoying if you really wanted it to vacuum more systematically and lived in a home with more foot traffic. Overall though, one month of use is not acceptable. I live in a two bedroom apartment-maybe 1000sq feet? I don’t have any animals and it’s just me so there isn’t a lot of dirt to pick up from day to day. I contacted customer service and they said the problem was an easy fix. They sent a video that I think was in Chinese, I’m not sure. This is to say that I didn’t understand it but I did watch it and was able to pop out the front wheel and clean it to stop the squeak. I’m not sure that this is a long term fix so I will likely have to clean the wheel once a month. It’s not the worst thing in the world, but it does make me wonder about the quality of the product overall. I purchased this on a holiday sale so it was under $100. Had I spent upwards of $300, I think I’d be even more disappointed. I just hope the vacuum will last. I’ll be looking at eufy or another brand if this one stops working. UPDATE: I added a star for longevity and because after I cleaned the front wheel it stopped squeaking and hasn’t squeaked since. I’ve had it now for just under a year and I appreciate that it continues to work. The customer service also sent me new filters and brushes free of charge to compensate for the squeak. In the end, I’m glad I purchased it. I hope it will continue to work well.","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2023"

I got this vacuum so that I could run it every day and I’d only have to vacuum my apartment myself once a week or so. It worked perfectly when I first got it (aside from the app being a bit of a pain). Unfortunately, I ended up getting very sick and being hospitalized and after finally being released from the hospital, I returned to my apartment find that the vacuum doesn’t hold its charge anymore! Bummer… it’s practically useless at this point, as it can’t even complete 1/4 of my 300 square foot living room before it starts beeping, flashing red and returns to the docking station to “charge.” Maybe I Justin got a defective unit, I’m jealous of all these other great reviews!","Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2023"

I also love that the brushes are long, so they reach corners that the robot can’t get too close. Definitely recommend! UPDATE AFTER ONE YEAR OF USE: I'm changing my review because sadly the robot stopped working after a year of use. Initially, it started not returning to the base when the battery was about to die, and then it just stopped charging. I bought a new battery online and replaced the old one, but it still didn't work.

It constantly gets stuck UNDER couches, kitchen cabinets, and furniture, where it will simply shut down. I don't run it when I'm not around to rescue it. The software most definitely DOES NOT navigate it around obstacles, as it bounces off of and into EVERYTHING. Most usually won't make the transition between a marble floor and a rug, and occasionally when it does, simply glosses over the rug leaving piles of hair and debris. It has no sense of where it has cleaned, routinely going back over a spot multiple times while leaving entire connected rooms untouched - the mapping shows huge gaps everywhere. It has a long-lasting battery life, though max suction mode cuts time to 1/3. Has developed an incessant high-pitched squeak that no amount of lubrication can relieve - very annoying!

I didn't expect it to pick up the small chunk of cashew that was under the couch, but I did expect it to pick up anything small and extremely light. As an example, there was a small piece of popcorn ceiling on the floor (polystyrene, not asbestos) about the size of a grain of rice. Ran over it twice, didn't pick it up.

B08R9LK9K3,2,"Terrible, I hate it","This has to be the dumbest ""smart"" thing ever. It's supposed to map the house, yet can never find it's dock. Maybe half the times it runs, it just keeps going in a circle and trying to eat it's dock, which makes it nearly impossible for it to go back to if it even were capable of finding it. It's afraid of light on the floor from windows and avoids it. It's constantly getting stuck under the couch on one end that's maybe 1/4"" shorter than the other side it doesn't get stuck under. It got stuck almost falling down the basement steps. We have herding dogs, so we have dog hair. This things sole purpose is to collect tumbleweeds from under the couch, and around furniture legs where things like that tend to collect. It kinda does. Not having the roller is nice, not having to detangle hair out of it constantly, but this severely limits it's ability to get hair and surface dirt off rugs and if you happen to put it on carpet. The vacuum mouth is too far from the floor surface to really be useful on carpets/rugs. Our first robot was a cheaper black Eufy, I forget the model. It was not ""smart"" at all, it could detect solid walls, but had a bumper-face so it just gently tapped things then turned a random direction and rolled off that way instead. It found it's home far more often, and somehow missed hair balls less often. The dumber robot did a better job, go figure.","Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,2,Dumb vacuum,"I've had a couple robot vacuums, but by far this has to be the stupidest vacuums I've ever owned. Have had it for a couple months now, and will continuously hit itself in the same spot on walls, doors, cabinets, etc. God forbid you have any loose wiring for electronic devices. It will continue to run them over, as if it were trying to purposely unplug them. I try to keep my floors as clear as possible, but its mission is to find anything it can run over and get caught on. There are other robot vacuums I would go with over this one.","Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,2,It doesn't work anymore.,"It worked very well for a while, then all of a sudden it stopped working. It won’t stop beeping, won’t hold a charge, and I’ve done all of the troubleshooting that was recommended. There is something wrong with the wheels as well but I’ve taken it apart and cleaned the whole thing, it still doesn’t work. I’m a little disappointed as this was one of the ways to keep up with all the dog hair in my house. I have three dogs, and it’s a lot to keep up with and this little robot vacuum made it much easier to deal with. I have a little one so the floors definitely need to be cleaned a couple times a day.","Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,2,Doesn’t charge and beeps red incessantly,"I was able to turn it on. Was able to connect to Wi-Fi. I was able to connect it to Alexa. But then it wouldn’t charge. Made sure it was in the right position. Made sure everything was turned on and plugged in and all it did was make this incessant beeping sound and flash red. It would flash light blue for a while, then flash red again. It came with 20% battery and stayed that way over 24 hours on the charging port. I was going to exchange it because maybe it’s a faulty charger or battery. Amazon said ‘I’m sorry you can’t exchange it.’ What?!!! Now I have to just return it and buy something else which will probably be more expensive since this was bought during prime days. I’m so mad! I have pet hair all over my living room as you can see in the video. I work long hours and have barely any time to vacuum. So purchase at your own risk. I gave two stars since I was able to pair with WiFi and Alexa.","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024"

It CAN work out without being programmmed but it seems to select it's functions/modes at random. After a few weeks of use, it's battery life is about an hour reliably, and even with programming FREQUENTLY looses the ability to locate the dock by itself (area around dock is kept clear of clutter). Ultimately, if you have a small hard floor apartment or don't mind doing the carpets yourself, it'll be an amazing find!

B08R9LK9K3,2,Bad robot,When I initially looked at this robo vac I thought how bad could it be….well let’s just say I’m glad it wasn’t a very expensive option. The app was incredibly difficult and disappointing for set up and the only way you can use this is if you have the app. It will map out the room but it’s useless because it doesn’t keep the data on the device and the battery doesn’t have enough of a charge to fully clean nor does it clean the whole room,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,2,Women Womp & Womp,Fresh out the box it worked once and after that it started but would stop. I called the support for Lefant which is the maker of this item. I wasn't pleased when the rep assumed I had left it on the charger for too long despite the fact I told her I used it once and it was on the charger 1 day. Needless to say it was great while it lasted. It was well made and quite pretty. I'm disappointed but I guess I'll have to spend a bit more for the more popular ones. I thought I was getting a great deal to get this for $88 at the time. Anyhow returning was super easy and convenient and I was refunded the same day so that was a plus.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,2,UPDATED - struggles to switch surfaces,"Dropped our review because the vacuum gets stuck when changing surfaces. This would be great if you had a house with 1 surface type because It works great on carpet or tile, or linoleum when it’s on the one surface. It’s a little drunk and stumbles switching surfaces and it can’t find its way home to the charger always but it sucks well! Ha! We run it twice a day because we have a shedding Golden Retriever and it does a great job at sucking up his fur. My Golden is a sloppy eater and he leaves kibble throughout the house and when the vacuum is on carpet it picks it up but on the other surfaces it pushes it around. Overall we are pleased with it for the price!","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2024"
B08R9LK9K3,2,It was great for 4 months,"I loved this little vacuum. I have two robot vacuums, and this one did a better job than a larger, more expensive unit. But it lived a very short life -- about 4 months -- which makes me sad. I've done all the steps recommended in the manual, and nothing works. And it seems too early to need to replace a battery. Doing the math, I spent $88 on it during a lightning sale, and it lived 4 months. That makes it $22/month to have someone else vacuum my hard floors. Maybe that's not a bad bargain after all...","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,2,Pretty good under perfect conditions,"As long as there are no cords on the floor, no area rugs that aren’t adhered to the floor, no stairs, and nothing too light to knock over this robot works well. It particularly fails whenever a power cord is anywhere on the floor so I have to make sure my cords are plugged in and run up the wall and out of the way. It’s knocked over a pretty substantial bowl of dog food and tends to fold my area rugs up and mash them into the corner of the room (sometimes getting stuck on top of the pile of rug). It ran itself off the stairs once so I now barricade the top of the stairs to run the vacuum in my living room. All that being said it is a decent value for the low price that it is. I connected it to Alexa so I can just say start cleaning. Also, I use the scheduling feature in the app for regular cleanings. My only gripe is that I really have to set up my house to accommodate the robot more than I would like to.","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,2,My first ever cleaning robot - does the job!,"I have a cat who sheds a lot of hair, plus a roommate who never sweeps. I got tired of having to sweep daily, so when I say this robot on sale, I was super excited to try it out. I’ve had it for a few months now, and I really like it! It picks up sooooo much of my cats fur! The app is pretty simple too and lets you see the amount of area it cleans in a session. It doesn’t have a setting to stop it from entering a certain room though and it’s honestly a little loud. I have hardwood floors so when they starts cleaning, it almost sounds like it’s trying to stop itself from going too fast lol. I do have a small apartment though, so it does have to make frequent stops and turns. Sometimes it still crashes into things without slowing down which can startle me or my cat at times. It doesn’t memorize your homes layout or whatever after every session though. In the future I’d definitely wanna get a vacuum that allows me to stop it from entering certain rooms and is also a little quieter on hardwood floors. I don’t know how great it’s on carpet since I use this vacuum exclusively in my kitchen and living room, but I do know it has a sensor to detect when it’s on carpet and increases its suction which is cool. Update: A year later, this robot squeaks throughout my apartment and crashes into doors frequently. Its suction has gotten weaker which is fine, I still vaccuum anyways, but the squeaking is unbearable. I have no idea why it’s doing that, and I regularly make sure everything in the vacuum is clean (cleaning it out, removing stuck hairs, etc.). I got this on sale when it was $100, but this is not worth more than $100.","Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2024"

B08R9LK9K3,2,Don’t buy,"After purchasing this robo vacuum in hopes of saving time on cleaning, I was disappointed with its performance. Unlike a traditional vacuum, this model did not effectively pick up debris due to a design flaw in the vacuum's hole, causing everything to fall out when the robot moved. Additionally, it struggled to pick up hair and crumbs as efficiently as expected. In comparison to my sister's robot vacuum, which cleans thoroughly and effectively, this robo vacuum fell short. The cleaning settings proved to be ineffective, as the vacuum moved randomly regardless of the selected setting.

B08R9LK9K3,2,Ehhhhhh- pain if breaks,"Stopped working 3 months after ordering, tried to contact support- it took multiple calls and tries to get through to someone.

B08R9LK9K3,2,"Can't recommend, low suction, spend a little more and get a Eufy or Roomba with bottom brushes","Grabbed on BF sale for $88, really wanted to like it but it's just not adequate. No bottom brushes, only the 2 ""whiskers"" in front. Very small suction port underneath. It does pull in some dust and hair on hardwood floors but it's very basic and lacking, you get what you pay for. I mean, this is better than nothing if you have a very limited budget. But spend a little extra for a Eufy or Roomba that has bottom brushes and much better suction power, especially for carpet. It's totally worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,2,Battery life is garbage,"The suction seems to be okay for this vacuum. The problem is the crappy battery. I had it set to standard suction, but the battery losses 15% of power before it’s even finished my 10x12 office. Heaven forbid it gets “stuck” in the middle of a cleaning. You have no way to track the vacuum. All you can do is click the button in the app to make it play a sound and then wander around until you find it. And don’t even try to have it finish the cleaning. It won’t. Once you find the stuck vacuum, it forgets that it has started cleaning and completely starts over. It has yet to finish a complete cleaning of my house.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2023"

B08R9LK9K3,2,Not a fan,I actually don't like the fact you need to set it up with the internet .. I don't have internet but using it without I felt it probably just runs not as great. I tried it twice and it kept doing short length sweeps and not long strides. I have the older version on a Lemont that I LOVED and had high expectations for this one . I hate it . It's more frustrating than anything because of the way it functions .. im returning and purchasing a different brand . I wish the older one I purchased was still available because I loved it but unfortunately my spiteful little dog pooped in my home with out me knowing and ran over it .. it was terrible haha . Sad story .. I wish this fit my expectations.

B08R9LK9K3,2,"Stopped working after a months, just spins in a circle","Just like the title says. It worked perfectly for the first month. Great value, it picks up pet hair with no problem because there is no brush. However, one day last week it quit cleaning after about 20 minutes. It's not a battery issue. The vacuum seemed to lose its way and went around in circles till it shut off in the middle of the room. We have tried multiple times, hoping the problem will go away and each time it will either back up off the charger and go in a circle or go in a circle without backing up and knock into its charger. Something is wrong with no way to reset.","Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023"

Other than that it’s crap. The app does not work properly, it will not connect to the Bluetooth, and I don’t like the fact that it has to get my phone number.

B08R9LK9K3,2,Does Not Clean the Whole Area,"This robot is so annoying! We bought this one to replace an older one we had that was not working so well. I like that the new one is white. That's about all I like about it. It does not seem to understand how to navigate the whole house (we live in a small house) and some days it does not even go into the bedrooms (2) to clean unless we physically put it there. It makes lots of annoying noise on our tile in the other rooms. It goes into places it doesn't belong and gets stuck. It doesn't seem to ""learn"" the floor plan where it lives like our other robt vac did. We bought this on a lightening deal price. Would NEVER pay full price for this thing and we are seriously considering returning it. We have a few more days to think about it. Cannot recommend this product!","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023"

B08R9LK9K3,2,Buy something else,"I was excited to find this vacuum on sale but honestly I wish I had gotten something else. It makes this terrible high pitch beeping noise just randomly, especially when it's at its base when it returns from a clean. I have had them do it on occasion but this does it repetitively it is driving me crazy. Also it does an okay clean but definitely isn't the best. It takes 2 or 3 rounds to actually get all the dirt off the floor. I was really disappointed with this vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,2,Very little suction,"I guess it's the old adage that you get what you pay for. My old robot vacuum finally died and I bought this on a whim because of the price. It really looks like it cleans the carpets---great vacuum lines showing that it has covered everything, however, when you open the little holder, it picks up almost nothing. I shed hair like crazy and my corgi at least doubles that and there was nothing in the holder. Plus I didn't notice until I had it home that there are only the brushes that go in circles to pull stuff toward the suction--not the one that rotates under the vacuum that actually seems to do most of the cleaning and pick up in other vacuums. Most likely will be returning before my window closes.","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,2,Ineffective,"I will start with the positive that this can be run with an app on my IPhone. It took me a couple tries to get it working but eventually it linked up. I like I can schedule a cleaning. Just wish it cleaned better. It blows the pet hair around instead of suctioning up. I have to use it twice as much as my old (different brand) one and it doesn’t get as clean. If the window was still open, I would return if.","Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,2,Battery doesn’t last long. You’ll have to take it completely apart to get to the battery,"This is great on bare floors, low profile and easy maneuvering. Loved it until the battery life went down dramatically. I can get 10 minutes of battery life. When it was new, it would go for close to an hour. Just contacted customer service at Lefant. Battery warranty is only one year. You’ll have to take it completely apart to get to the battery. Customer service Claudia was not very nice at all. She was annoyed when I tried to get help purchasing another battery. They can do better.","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,2,Just Spend the Extra Money,"We've had the M210 for about 4 months now. I'll keep it as short as possible: Pros: Easy to maintain, decent size trap. App control works well. Works as a vacuum for the area it hits and does well for smaller debris. Cons: Won't hit your whole floor. Ever. Bumps into the same things constantly, as in it hits the same places over and over. No mapping is truly a disappointment if the detection system is going to be this bad. We constantly have to move it when it gets stuck under furniture, tables, etc. Battery life is terrible. Will cover about half of our 1300 sq ft house (Possibly would cover the whole house if it didn't end up in the same places). Won't pick up larger clumps of hair, will just push it around instead, which is understandable so not really on the vacuum. Lastly, it has a feature to return to its base but good luck. It will most likely die long before it makes it back.","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2023"
B08R9LK9K3,2,Very basic,"I thought the description about the app and it “learning” the home layout meant it would actually be able to efficiently clean a room. Unfortunately, that is not the case. It repeatedly goes over the same areas multiple times without proceeding to the rest of the room. I tried using the “edge” option so it could get a full layout of the room, but it did not stick to the wall and continued in the center of the room. Not bad for a basic robot vacuum, but I already have one of those that’s ~8 years old. I thought this would be an upgrade, but it doesn’t do anything more than my old one does. I will be returning.","Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2023"

B08R9LK9K3,1,Falls off charger and now won’t charge at all,"I tried to like this vacuum. It has a lot going for it. However, it’s not reliable and the auction is not at all high enough. For a household with kids. It needs to be twice as strong and will not vacuum a small crumb or piece of cereal. Still, it would get most things if I ran it every day. When it was working, it would not always return to charge. It can vacuum 1-2 small rooms before running out of battery. That would be fine if it would charge by itself, but it doesn’t. I had to place on charger and then check the charger several times to make sure it hadn’t moved off. Once it charged, I had to schedule a vacuum right away or I would find it moved off the charger of its own accord and dead. After a few weeks of this, all the issues got worse. I contacted the company through the app several times. No response. Now it just sits on the charger blinking a red light. It will not charge. I had to go through Amazon’s terrible customer service in order to return it and get a refund. Not happy. Not worth the risk.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"

When this yielded the same error, I was told the vacuum was defective and to contact Amazon for support. Initially I paid for a prime week-long trial to receive same day delivery, but the replacement is not due for 5 days.

B08R9LK9K3,1,Short lived,"TLDR doesn't last. After 15 months the thing just screeches loudly when on the charging dock and then continues to screech when removed from the charging dock. It had to sleep in the car twice because the beeping wouldn't stop and it was making us insane. The battery won't charge now but prior to that it stopped responding to being started by pressing the button on the top and I could only run it with the remote control (which was free with the first one I bought - now they charge you for that separately I found out when I bought a second one for the finished basement.) Then the charging and nonstop beeping began. And I haven't been able to use it since then. I'm very disappointed because At first I loved this vacuum, it would get stuck on things and couldn't find it's way back to the charging station but it still picked up a lot of dog hair so the other stuff didn't bother me too much. I would typically use it once to twice a week and was happy with it for the price I paid.

B0CNKX4429,5,My vacuum helper,"Play Video I have been wanting an automatic vacuum for quite some time but was hesitant that it would actually clean good. I still have to learn how to use this and see if I can set boundaries with this model but straight out of the box and not even fully charged for my first use (I would recommend charging it the full 3 hrs. as suggested, I accidentally started it and let it go!) it did great. The photos are from running two days in a row and as you can see the dirt bin is full so it is definitely cleaning. I’m hoping I can program it better because right now it seems to be all over the place and it doesn’t fully get one area before moving on to the next and it misses some trash/dirt since it is sporadic. I will update on that after I’ve learned how to use it! I’m happy with this purchase as of now. If you don’t want to clean the bin every day or two I would recommend getting the self emptying model. I just wanted to try the basic vacuum for now and see if it was worth it. I am a professional cleaner and so I have high expectations and so far this has met my needs. It has some “sweeper legs” that get in corners or edges like under counters and sometimes it does miss stuff but I know it is working as I have to empty the dirt bin frequently. It’s making my life a little easier! We named ours Dusty! It is not too loud but if your on a phone call it’s best to go to another room as it can be a little distracting. I set mine to go off at 12 pm every day and like clock work Dusty comes out and goes to work! The app was super easy to set up and like I said I am still learning and hope to set up specifics if I can with this model. The only issue I have had so far is that it will get stuck on a couple of my rugs. They are thick rugs so one it just stops and the alarm goes off for an error that it could not move. The other rug it says it is near a cliff lol! It isn’t that high of a rug but it is higher than the hard wood floors I have. I just move it and press start. It is a little aggravating but nothing too bad. I’m home all the time so I can move it but if I wasn’t I’m not sure if I could do anything from the app (again, still learning!) Also, make sure cords are picked up and if you have any sticky bug traps I’d move them because the little sweeper legs have gotten stuck to mine and I had to pull it off. Other than those two things I am loving my automatic vacuum and I recommend it his product. If I remember I will update my review after I’ve had it for a while longer!","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2023"
B0CNKX4429,5,"Perfect For the Price Point, a Pet Owners Must have","I have 3 dogs that have a doggie door. To pick up all the debris they bring in, I use this Roomba almost everyday. It’s basic and I have not used the wireless feature yet, but also don’t see a need, so I can't comment on that. What I love is having a vacuum robot like the Jetzens! Yay for technology! I have a few minor dislikes: It could be quieter, it misses dirt, and I do not like cleaning it. I spilt flour on the flour and it didn’t pick it up no matter how many times I coaxed it back. It gets stuck and can’t find its way back out of a few places like, under the sofa, between the legs of one of my tables, on the pedals of my piano, and 2 places under the cabinets. That said, it doesn’t do that every time. Emptying the dust compartment can be messy, as well as, cleaning the twisted threads & hair off of the rollers that needs scissors and a pry tool to clean. It’s time consuming. Also, don’t throw away your broom and dustpan yet, you’ll need it to clean the spots it misses. Right now it’s vacuuming under the sofa I’m sitting on and has found its way back out, it headed to the aforementioned table as I write and is not getting stuck. It also finds things like the back of my remote control. It will chipper as it scoots things around to alert you of it’s findings. It’s powerful and I’ve found it on top of my piano pedals diligently trying to clean them. That’s powerful! I also have another basic model from years back that still works and yes, I run both at the same time. The older model is not as effective or powerful. A few days ago, I noticed the bristles on the edge cleaner brush were completely broken off and the wheel was damaged. A quick, same-day prime delivery offered replacement parts at a ridiculous low cost & easy fix. It’s great at this price point, I spent double for the first model I bought about 7 years ago.","Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,5,Works great,"This is my 4th roomba. I bought my first 17 years ago. I am very impressed with the upgrades in noise and design over the years. This one moves under furniture easily, is much quieter, and is strong and much cheaper than my first. Running daily gets so much dust and all the pet hair and saves me from having to manually sweep every day. Now I only sweep once to twice a week when I mop. I would love the one with the mopping feature as well but decided against it because I was afraid my dog would track through and leave paw prints.

B0CNKX4429,5,Roomba does roomba things,"My mother has had a roomba for over 7 years now so I decided to stay faithful to the brand.

I don't think it's too loud, and you can only switch on when away from home. Cleans pet litter well, haven't tested on rugs yet.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,5,Works wonderfully on all floor types and won’t go over drop offs,"Technically, I would give this 4-1/2 out of 5 stars. I have four cats, and it does an amazing job considering all of the pet hair, dander, and scattered stray cat litter pieces. Honestly, it does almost as well as my Shark vacuum, which was specifically designed for pet hair. I have mostly tile and wood floors, but there are a few rugs scattered throughout the place. It moved seamlessly through the different floor types and has no trouble going over thresholds. As you can see in the video, it detects drop offs and avoids them. I have an 8” drop off between my living room and entryway and it easily avoided it. One thing I’m not crazy about, but I’m hoping it will do better at once it maps things out thoroughly and runs a few times, is dirt that is between a rug and a hard surface doesn’t always get cleaned as well as I’d like. However, considering I have cats, and I have to vacuum once or twice a day, it’s still worth not having to deal with it! I would highly recommend cleaning the rollers on the bottom regularly if you have pets. The roller can get pretty full of animal hair if they’re shedding much on your floor. I still think I’ll have to give it one thorough vacuuming a week, but I think this will work the rest of the time. After buying this model, I am kind of excited to try the Roomba model that both vacuums and mops in the future. I got this model for only $68 during prime day and it was an open box item that was brand new, so I can’t beat that value. (Brand new ones that hadn’t been shipped before we’re selling for almost $275!) Gotta love Prime day! Right out of the box this was very easy to set up. After charging for a few hours, it easily ran for 45 minutes and probably would’ve run longer if I hadn’t ended the vacuum sequence. Unfortunately, the model I had doesn’t have as good a smart mapping capability as I had hoped, so it took several passes through in some areas for it to find the edges of the surface that needed vacuuming. Since it’s already improving. I expect this to get better after it runs more. If anything changes, I will update my review.","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,5,Absolutely necessary,I really wanted to have a roomba upstairs so I waited a few months for a good deal and snagged this one so my old guy could work upstairs! My last one is still kicking after about & years so I have high hopes for this one too! Cleans up well and works and works until either the battery dies or there’s absolutely nothing left to clean. Seems to be able to make it to the docking station 30-40% of the time. The other times it cleans until the battery dies. This one rarely gets stuck and actually does a much better job going between the different floor types (our old one got stuck between rooms with the transition).,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,5,Best one yet,"I have two German Shepherds…. Which equals a lot of fur… therefore we have four roombas. Yes FOUR. The roomba on the right is the first one I’ve ever owned. It was great. They don’t seem to make that one anymore and I wasn’t a fan of the second one that now lives in our basement…so I bought this one, the one on the left, recently to help keep up with the fur. This one does seem to get stuck under furniture more than the other two… however it gets over things better, runs quieter and vaccums both the carpet and hardwood just as well if not better. So…. I bought a second one haha. I highly recommend. I have all four scheduled to run every day, they work well with Alexa and I truly have no complaints. If I needed a fifth roomba I would 100% buy a third of this model, even if they still made the original one!","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,5,Glad we took the plunge.,"Neither I nor my partner are, by nature, fans of tech. It took us two years of toying with the idea to finally take a chance with this Roomba. We live in a dry high desert climate so lots of dust during the hot summers and mud during the wet winters. Add a constantly shedding dog and two humans who go in out frequently (neither of whom is interested in sweeping 2-3 times per day) and we mostly lived unhappily with dirty floors. After watching a number of videos, we decided on the Roomba 694 which was about $180. It came in a couple of days, then sat unopened for a couple of weeks, due tech hesitancy. We needn't have worried. The instructions are super easy for basic setup. I have not yet downloaded the app, as there were quite a few poor reviews in the Google Play store. So we just charged ""Agador"" up and turned him loose. We have a combination of wood, laminate and area rugs. We took the obvious potential problems out of the way - some loose electrical cord jumbles and piles of loose papers. He did his thing and we kept an eye on him but the only thing we had to save him from was the tray that holds the dog dishes. He climbed over the low edge and was banging around, slopping water. So that needs to be put up. We only let him work for about an hour, as we had several people visiting and Etta Mae was barking herself into a frenzy every time Agador came near her, but in that time he managed to get in and out of the bathroom, the laundry room and a couple of bedrooms from his original start in the living room. He had no problem going from hard floor to carpet and dealt easily with the area rugs. One had a loose thread on the edge, which Agador tried to pick up, but we noticed and cut it off before it caused him a problem. There was no noticeable pattern, just lots of bumbling around our very cluttered areas but he did fill up his dirt collector. Since then, he seems to have gotten much better. He gets around the table and chair legs faster and cleans that area better than the first few times. By looking at the marks on the carpeted area, I can see that he is getting more effective at covering the entire area in the bedrooms and our hard floors in the high traffic areas look really clean after each of his twice daily cleaning sessions. (Bonus: It makes me want to mop more often when I don't have to sweep first.) Every few days I use the broom to get in/under a couple dust collecting places where he doesn't fit or I don't allow him, like under the computer desk where there worst tangle of cords lives. I just sweep that dirt out into the open area and turn Agador loose. Etta is getting used to him and the noise level he produces is not enough to bother me since I usually have an audiobook or something playing in my earbuds when I'm stuck indoors. If and when I download the app, I will report back here. But I could happily use him just the way I am now for a long time.","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2022"

B0CNKX4429,5,Read this and have realistic expectations,"If you’re looking to never use a hand vacuum ever again, then this is not for you; because you will be severely disappointed. This is a machine that will bump its’ way around your home and travel in no particular direction. However, that is exactly what you signed up for. This model of the Roomba does not have a mapping feature, so to ask why it wonders around aimlessly is pointless. If you’re looking for a machine that’s going to replace your hand vacuum forever and clean as efficiently as a cleaning service, then you might need to look at the $700+ models that DOES have a mapping feature and higher specs. This $200+ is more or less a base model and is not ever going to replace your hand vacuum. I have myself and one dog in a 700 sq ft apartment (no stairs; but lots of floor rugs!) There is a consistent layer of dog and human hairs on the carpet and floorboards. What the Roomba does, is it zooms around my apartment during the week, picking up stray hairs and dust bunnies as well as get under the coffee tables and cupboards. Getting to those harder to reach places; or items of furniture I’m always too lazy to move out of the way to vacuum. This means that in between the times that I use my hand vacuum (about once a week), I don’t have a crazy amount of dog hair floating around and I don’t need to go out of my way to vacuum in those hard to reach places. It has had no trouble at all climbing over all of my area rug, doormats, bathroom rugs (high pile with tassels!) or any of the multiple smaller area rugs in the hallway or the bedroom. You do need to clean the dustbin out after each use, and it says that as part of the maintenance. Running this Roomba for an hour in my 700 sq ft apartment, with one dog and one human’s worth of hairs will fill up the dust bin. If you’re buying this to run continuously in your 3000 sq ft home; again you’re going to be very disappointed. Owning this particular model of the Roomba, there are going to be some limitations. You can’t compare a $200 product to a $700+ product and expect that they perform the same way with the same bells and whistles. If you’re looking for a robot vacuum that picks up the hairs and dust that life throws at you in between deep cleans, then this is for you. Customer Service with the iRobot team has also been great. I had some connectivity issues and they were super responsive and solution orientated.","Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2021"

B0CNKX4429,5,This is my second Roomba - like it even better,"I bought my first Roomba (696) back 12 years ago and was very happy with it. But recently I noticed it was getting stuck easily and not negotiating obstacles as well as it used to. So I went to clean it....then I noticed that the wheels had no more tread on them. They were worn off smooth. I called tech support and it turns out I could buy a new set of wheels for $79. Or I could buy a brand new model 694 for $179. So I bought a new one. Now after using the new one, I think it is a bit quieter and doesn't clunk into things so hard or often. Seems they have made a few improvements in the model since I first got mine. To make this short, I read through the various comments and feedback and I think some people's expectations are too high. Its a vacuum and it does make some noise. It doesn't do mapping and so it does run into things, and it does just ""run around haphazardly"" until it basically runs down the battery and then it goes back home to get charged up. More often than not, it does make it home too, although on occasion it closes a closet door on itself or runs up on a wire or something. I can judge how well it works based on the fact that I need to empty the dust bin almost every day. That's a good thing! Overall, it was a $179 well spent as without I would spend way too much time cleaning up dog hair and dirt with a broom. So yes, having some open spaces in my rooms and not a whole lot of clutter, I would definitely buy this again. Thank you Roomba.","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,5,Impressive home vacuum assistant,"After reading reviews on all the different robot vacuum cleaners, this is the Roomba I chose. It does a great job picking up hair, dust and light debris on the floor. It's great to have a ""second set of hands"" to keep up with cleaning between regular vacuuming and cleaning if you like a super clean home. It doesn't replace the regular vacuuming with a HEPA vacuum cleaner, but it does do a significant job in between regular cleanings. The dust bin was full each time we have run it. Impressive. It was easy to empty the dust bin and clean the brushes on the base of the cleaner. I do appreciate ease in cleaning. It does well on hardwood floors, tile, as well as wool and sythnetic rugs. It is able to transition over thresholds and even lamp bases. As it is pretty narrow, it slides under the sofa and other furnishings to pickup dust and debris. You can program it to do regular cleanings so if you want the Roomba to clean on Mondays at 9 AM, it will do it or you can have it clean manually. This is available on the phone app. It takes about 90 minutes to clean and then it returns to its charging station. And you can move it floor to floor to clean other levels of the home. It is not super smart as it bumps and finds it way around furniture and other things, but eventually it finds itself out of the location it got into. I'm ok with this as I've learned you just need to make space for it to maneuver and get things off the ground before a cleaning session. I don't need it to map out my location as I prefer privacy over efficiency as my spaces are not huge. Because it can go over thresholds, it can sometimes get caught up on the base of our stools which is a metal, wire base. This is where the Roomba signals defeat and it sends an alert on your phone. It is a bit loud as you can hear it vacuuming through the house, but if you're on a different level and you shut your door while working, it is hardly noticeable. Overall, I'm happy with this Roomba. It's cost effective and helps around the house. Who doesn't want some help?","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2023"

B0CNKX4429,5,Loud but powerful,"I bought this newer standard version of the roomba after my old one finally died. I had that one since 2017, and it only need a few replacement parts here and there. This one has a sleeker look. The brushes were also a different look than my previous, this with a mix of a rubber and almost bristle brush style versus two rubber. The bristle brush picks up a lot of hair! My hair, dog hair, any hair. This is great because I have a high shedding dog and I use the roomba during the week inbetween my in-depth vacuums. I would say it performs the way I need it to and I would purchase it again for the same reason. This doesn’t map your place. Thankfully I have a smaller apartment, so it just bumping around it usually can get majority of the rooms. I’m also more impressed with the wheels this time. It doesn’t get as stuck underneath dressers as my old one did and it also can get over random obstacles in the way. My only negative is how LOUD it is. My old one you could hear but it just did its thing. This one sounds like loud mechanical, almost crunchy. I just make sure to run it when I’m outside the house or not when I’m expecting a phone call. I would recommend this for a standard vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2024"

But once you clear the floor of any obstructions, this thing works great. When I was moving out of my old apartment, I let it run in the lower level for 35 minutes.

B0CNKX4429,5,Ruby the Roomba - Extra helping hand!,"Roombas really are a time-saver on those deep clean days. Its nice not to have to worry about sweeping and vacuuming when you have laundry, dishes, bathrooms, kitchen to do/clean etc!! Down side is yes, it does get stuck with hair every now and then. I don't ever let it clean when I'm not home because it ALWAYS ends up getting stuck somewhere or the hair keeps it from continuing. Sometimes it does get stuck in the area beneath our couch and our bed. So I've found it's better to let it clean while I am home so I can manage it. Which kind of sucks, I would love to be able to have it clean while I am not home since it is loud. I mean, cannot complain, it is a VACCUUM. Vacuums tend to be loud lol so it's not as bad compared to a traditional one. I just wish it would navigate a little better. That being said, sometimes it also cleans in weird patterns. I've used it countless times and it has yet to be able to really ""map"" out the different rooms/areas in our apartment which is also a bummer. Sometimes I will have to section it off in the kitchen or the bedroom or bathroom just so it will focus on cleaning those floor surfaces only until they've been fully swept. It says eventually Roomba ""learns"" each room of your home and will eventually have the ability to only focus/clean certain areas but I have yet to have access to that feature. Maybe I need to purposely set that up in the app, not really sure. But aside from those things, it really is a helping hand with one less tiresome chore to do at home. DO NOT regret purchasing this thing at all!","Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,5,Great vacuum within reason,"We've had a 600 series irobot since before wifi was even an option. We have pets. We've had as many as 6 pets between cats and dogs at different points. Does a robot vacuum clean as thoroughly with awesome suction as a good, regular vacuum? Of course not! What it does do is vacuum pretty darn well every day (or close to it; at least every weekday). Picking up most of the dirt and pet hair every day keeps it under control really well, and the robot vacuums while I'm working or doing other things, which is perfect for our house. Let's face it, doing an Ok job of vacuuming every day is way better than, um, how often I was vacuuming before we had a robot! ;) After a bunch of years (I don't remember how many), Rover needed some replacement parts. We've done that before, just on minor stuff that was worn out, and I do like having a brand of robot for which parts are readily available. This time, though, I saw the 694 on Cyber Monday sale. Since it's still a 600 series, the extra filters and stuff we have are compatible. Rover has been retired, and Jarvis has been doing a great job in his place! I don't think the wifi is a necessary feature, but it does amuse me to start the vacuum from my phone or by asking my home assistant to do it. I'm sure I'll eventually need the ""locate"" feature, which wasn't a feature on our old vacuum. I do like being able to see the battery status, and I'm supposed to be able to diagnose things, but (knock on wood) Jarvis has been a healthy little guy so far (as of 2 months in). So, all in all, I think Jarvis is a great little robot. He keeps our dirt and pet hair under control, and he does it all for me! I just empty his bin after feeding the menagerie every morning and let him run around while I do other morning tasks.","Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,5,Love it!!,"I realize this is the version that has the least amount of features and no area mapping, but I got to say I love it.

Even without mapping somehow it covers my whole house. I just watched it closely for several days to make sure it didn’t get hung up anywhere and I made some slight adjustments to furniture positions and I hung some cords up on the walls so they didn’t get caught up. My floors are a mix of hardwood, laminate and area rugs. The only problem it has is with one area rug That is a real plush pile rug, and it does not run up on that. But this rug is out-of-the-way in my house and I can and will replace it. It cleans all the hardwood around the rug really well.

B0CNKX4429,5,You will be amazed at just how much better the floors look ALL the time,"Possibly my favorite purchase ever. It was a warehouse purchase, on discount I took a chance and could not be more pleased. We have hardwood and we have dogs. Little dogs with fluffy feet that pick up dirt and debris every time they go outside. This dirt accumulates alarmingly quickly. Skip a thorough sweeping & vacuuming every single day and it looks terrible, it feels gritty and the house looks unkempt. This has been a revelation, seriously. Took it out of the box, charged it up, connected it to the app and away it went picking up grit, bits of leaves, grass, tiny twigs and whatever else the pups decided to bring in. It continued until the floor was swept. Initially, it did require a factory reset because it was returned but we were through the reset process in 5 minutes or less. You have to baby/roomba proof a bit if you want to run this every day, trouble free. Puppy toys need to be picked up, potty pads cannot be down unless you want to tempt fate. It will get hung up on the clunky threshold molding in one room so we block that. We do not have stairs to worry about. We run it every morning when everyone is out of the house. For me, it's too noisy to run at night on the same floor with the bedrooms. As it learns the layout of the rooms and furniture, it gets better. I empty the dirt cup and wipe it down every day. The floors are swept all the time. I love the results.","Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,5,Beyond Great and Entertaining Too!,"Play Video We recently replaced much of our carpeting with LVT. After a few days, we noticed dog hair everywhere, especially along the walls. We never realized how the carpeting hid the dog hair. Since we don’t want to sweep several times a day, we decided to buy a Roomba. After reading the reviews of the 694 and other brands, I opted for the 694. We got it today. I plugged it in to charge, downloaded the app and proceeded to set it up. Set up mainly consists of connecting it to your router. You can set up different cleaning routines for different areas of your house or just let it explore. For its maiden voyage, we had it vacuum the dining room. It is raised about 7 inches above the living room and is a distinct separate area. Ideal for a test trial. I created the favorite, Vacuum Dining Room, which just consists of giving it a name and putting Roomba in the room with its base. I started the routine from my iPad and it came out of its base. I quickly realized I needed to pull out the chairs from the table so it could get under them. And, you need to make sure there is enough room for it to get into every area of the room where you want it to clean. The video shows Roomba cleaning the dining room. My husband and I really enjoyed watching it and watching it learn. It got stuck once when it nearly fell off the raised area. It called for help and requested it be moved to another area. I picked it up, put it down and off it went. When it was done, it went to its garage and announced it was done. We decided to give it a shot in a bigger area which included the LVT. While our dog totally ignored it when it was in the dining room, she perked up when it started cleaning in the living room. The photo shows our dog watching it, half asleep. Interestingly, when it headed towards her, our dog just got up and stepped out of the way. Right now it is about 60 feet away cleaning the laundry room. The battery indicator is red and it should be coming home soon. It’s smart so I think it will find its way. Well, Roomba ran out of gas! It sent a message saying it needed to be returned to the base station. We finally found it in a corner of the laundry room, exhausted, near death. After emptying the dust bin, we carried it back to the base station. It is charging now. We will let it fully charge before sending it out again. It is a great device. My only criticism it that it doesn’t alert you when the dust bin needs emptying. So, it can keep running around, unable to pick up more. We do have a very large house, so this may not be a problem for most.","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2021"

B0CNKX4429,5,So glad I bought this!!,"I've been wanting a robot vacuum for years but never could pull the trigger. We're a family of 4 with 2 kids and a dog so it gets pretty messy sometimes. I actually have 2 working stand vacuums but neither one has ever been that great (broken parts, bulky, smelly, low suction...). I hate using them so much, I figured it was time to invest in a new one with better quality. So I realized in my research that this model Roomba has really good reviews and was more affordable than I thought it would be. A decent stand vac is probably comparable in price but since I'm investing in the product anyway, may as well get the one that's also a service! I got it delivered same day (yesterday! I haven't even had it 24 hours!) and set it up and had it running in a few hours. Now let me tell you, I probably hadn't vacuumed in a month and our floors were DIRTY! This little work horse got going right away and does not stop! She goes under furniture I haven't bothered to move in years. She whips dirt and debris from wall edges and then sweeps back around later to suck them up. You can't help but watch her go! It's like, you start to root for her to get in a tight squeeze under a chair or over a metal bar to get to where she senses dirt. I find myself stopping and saying ""you're not going to try and go under that are you- ohhpp there you go you did it!!"" She does NOT back away from a challenge and will kind of nudge closet doors or blocks out of her way. Sometimes she'll get caught on a errant blanket or bedskirt but it's kind of funny to stumble upon (or be alerted by the app) that she's stuck halfway up a piece of fabric. She almost seems annoyed like - ""can you get this out of my way, I'm trying to work here."" I hope this doesn't discredit my review but I swear it's almost like she has a personality.

B0CNKX4429,5,This would make a great gift for anyone.,"I bought this with some birthday money, and I'm so glad I did! I love this thing. Watching it hunt around for anything to pickup is cute and satisfying. We have two pets and two adults with long hair, so it has lots to do. I am thrilled it goes under the bed and sofas, no more moving the furniture and getting embarrassed haha. Yes there is maintenance, it makes sense, get yourself a sharp pair of scissors and old fine tooth comb and clean your Roomba. I do it a couple times a week, as my sons ""covid hair"" is extra long, and I swear he sheds more than usual. I could go on and on, but like I said, I would buy it again and in fact am going to get it for my MIL for Christmas, Im really looking forward to that. My only worry is that Ill wear it out as I use it once a day. I guess we will see. I bought it Sept 1 2022. UPDATE - 3/14 2023. Roomba still going strong! I clean the brushes and tap the dust out of the filter once a week. Its amazing to me how much it finds on what I already consider a clean house. Mostly fuzz and hair from who knows where. To clean the brushes I bought a seam ripper, it speeds up the process and has a nice point to clean out around the end pieces. Often times I tap out the filter dust into the garbage can and once I washed it in cool water and it looked brand new again. Occasionally I will unscrew the little side brush to check for strings or hair, sometimes I find some. I have it set to run around once a day at noon. So basically, with weekly maintenance,I have a Roomba that works just as great as the day I bought it with no additional purchased parts and still going strong. I couldn't be happier with it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2022"
B0CNKX4429,5,Basic and Easy-Peezy!!,"I had a 10-year-old iRobot vacuum that I LOVED that finally died. It was a basic, easy to use with no bells and whistles. I ordered other brands and had a hard time with set ups and use. I decided to go back to basics with this model and so-so glad that I did!! It’s a snap to set up the unit and install on my phone. I scheduled it to start at 7 a.m. and it worked like a charm!! It’s much quieter than my previous model- so much so that I went to look for it in my small house to see if it was stuck somewhere- no, just quiet. Picked up my dog’s fur with no issues.

B0CNKX4429,5,Soooo nice to have,"I was a little skeptical at first, you see a bunch of people complain and give remarks of course... so first time buying felt like a gamble. So worth it. Some complained about mapping and it getting stuck Granted? Not too much of a problem for me, it might get stuck sometimes but... eh... oh well. Run it again. Granted I clean up furniture to make it Roomba friendly, but outside of that? Super cool. There are some places where it seems like it gets stuck in a loop? For example it runs through the kitchen four times sometimes... eventually to figures it out and goes elsewhere, but eh. Not a minus 1 star for me. I also don't write code for robots. So my criticism may be worthless there. It does require some level of maintenance, cleaning the bushes, empty the filter and so on... which is totally fine. You have to do that with a normal push vacuum, so not a big surprise. (Handles hair as you'd think, eventually it clogs... 2 cats and a girlfriend. That's a lot of hair. But not the end of the world.) One surprise, or feature, that I absolutely adore is the Health function. Gives an estimate on how long certain parts have as far as a run time goes. Scroll down they have a link to buy replacement parts. So so so nice that they have that. I like fixing things and this is way easier than fixing a full vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,5,You can fix these yourself,"My last iRobot product lasted for 10 years with shedding dogs. I had to repair it several times to keep it going. I was very happy to see iRobot lets you repair YOUR stuff! I was able to order several replacement parts over the years. The robot was easy to take apart and fix. This model is new so I do not have a repair history with it yet. However there are too many companies (Apple) who want your to throw out you equipment and buy new after a year or two. Don't fall into that trap, buy something you can fix yourself. So far it is working just great. Having it vacuum everyday helps keep the house nice and free from pet hairballs.","Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,5,My favorite home Appliance,"I have always thought the idea of a Roomba was a great idea - and wanted one. On Prime Day - a Great sale price came up and I bout it. I am so happy to have gotten it. It does a pretty great job, there are places that it gets stuck ( two in my house). and Occasionally it gets confused and keeps vacuuming too long be fore returning to base for the recharge - but, its an appliance - its not The Lost inSpace Robot - so , come on - what do you expect? I love that I can have it do vacuuming when I am home or away and It goes for an hour or more and Doing that almost everyday - I am doing the clean up far more than I would if I was out there vacuuming the floors. I love that it goes under the bed and under the couch and furniture - hitting those areas you often miss. It is a random pattern each day - so to get the best results - run it several times week - it will hit differs areas on different days . It uses a variety of random patterns - so used often - it will hit all the areas. I would use it initially when home - so you can see if there are areas it gets hung up on in your space. I have two spots with uneven dips under furniture - it can get under but then gets stuck - I Just put a pair of shoes in front of those spots when I'm running it and it gets the rest of the house - I can deal with those two little spots independently. That way - I can generally run it remotely form the app and when I come home - the room has been vacuumed - I would recommend - this one is not as programable as some of the more expensive models - but , if you are considering one - a great price for the world of Home cleaning automation!","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2022"
B0CNKX4429,5,Absolutely love it,"It works great, except it can get stuck under the edge of the couch or a cabinet easily. I wish it would learn not to go there. Also no good with bathroom rugs.

B0CNKX4429,5,Basic but gets the job done!,"This is our second roomba. We bought an earlier (or original) version of this model 5ish years ago and paid almost twice as much for it, since robot vacuums were still fairly new at the time. We only decided to replace as parts were starting to break and the cost to fix didn't make sense. Like my title suggests, this model is quite basic, but meets my needs. No, its not very ""smart"" and sometimes spends most of its cleaning time trying to navigate its way out from under a chair or table, but it saves me from having to clean under and behind furniture. Pros: you can program it to run on a schedule. Does an excellent job of keeping the floor clear of crumbs, dust bunnies, and dirt tracked in from outdoors. We don't have pets but with three females in the house the shedding is real and this roomba keeps our floors hair-free so I imagine it would do the same for pet hair. Battery runs for 90 min+ (it actively vacuums for 90 min but there's enough battery power to allow it up to 30 more minutes to find its way back to the charging station). Cons: like I said, it isn't ""smart"" so it isn't going to efficiently map out your house, some cleaning sessions will be spent on one section of the cleaning area, but if you run it often enough all areas will get attention. It is kind of loud so try to schedule cleanings when you don't want the extra noise. The dirt bin does need to be emptied after each cleaning, but its not so inconvenient that its worth the extra expense of the model with the self-emptying bin (IMO). All in all this is a great little vacuum for the price and makes my life so much easier!","Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2023"
B0CNKX4429,5,So impressed!,I read all of the good reviews of tech/vacuum blogs and the reviews here. I was skeptical still for some reason and I didn’t need to be! This vacuum is perfect. I’m a typical woman who sheds lots of long hair all over the place that clogs my traditional vacuum. I also have 2 long hair cats that shed more than any cats I’ve ever seen. This vacuum did a great job with the hair and was easy to clean after. It’s maiden voyage was a little rocky with it going places I didn’t want like under console tables where it would get stuck and I needed to help. It also snuck behind my couch and unplugged my recliner. It’s a sneaky little guy and his tracks looked like a drink vacuum with no real method but he got everything clean and looked adorable while doing it.

So I turn Kyrro on and shut the door. When I’d return, he’ll have my place looking new. I’ll then move on to next room, then the next. At the end, I’ll empty his canister, thank him, and send him back home for recharging. Kyrro can be a hard-worker at times. He’ll clean on his way home in which I’m appreciative of his thoroughness.

B0CNKX4429,5,Roomba rocks,"I debated for a while about getting a robotic vacuum. Read all the reviews and finally took the plunge. I have long haired cats and long hair myself. It vacuums all the hair up. That said, you will need to clean the robot after each use. I debated getting the next level up that would empty itself but figured if I had to clean it, I'd be emptying it first anyway. Its storage compartment is small so it needs emptying every time it's used. The first week, I used it every day. The second week, every other day and the third week every third day. With the cat hair, my long hair and vacuuming under the beds and couches, every other day works best. The roller brushes work fine but the hair does get wrapped around--hence cleaning it. The filter gets really, really dirty. I've cleaned them with compressed air and can get a while out of them The generic replacement brushes and filters on Amazon worked for me...see another review. The app is not as robust as the higher end models but certainly adequate. You'll need wifi on when you use the robot or all the time if you schedule. I have not set a schedule because I want to be around when it runs with the cats. One chases it and the others go hide. It's not very loud--certainly quieter than most vacuums. You need to make sure the charging base in on level flooring or it won't reconnect itself to recharge. And no matter what time amount I set for a programmed schedule, it just vacuums til it runs out of battery...about 70 minutes. I'm OK with that. It tells you when it's done. I had to reroute some cords, put up cat toys and a couple of other things but not more than with normal vacuuming just different. I don't think more suction would make a difference unless the waste compartment was bigger. And I like the ""randomness"" of the vacuuming--fun watching it go around. OK, it's the pandemic and I'm easily entertained. Hopefully, it last a long time as I'm loving not vacuuming!!!","Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2021"
B0CNKX4429,5,Good basic product,"I purchased this particular model on the recommendation of a magazine article. I'm very happy with it. It is very basic, however. So, if you want to program it with your phone or computer, that can't be done. It is also NOT self-cleaning, so you need to clean the tray yourself. It's also best for a small space. I live in a studio apartment and it works perfectly in my space. I do not have a pet, but it picks up my hair easily and any crumbs on the kitchen floor or dining area. Although, I don't have children that drop food, so the stuff on the floor is minimal. I purchased this so I'm not always cleaning up hair from the floor. I run it every other week and it picks up quite a bit of lint, dust, crumbs and hair from the floor. So, far very happy with this product. We will see how long it lasts.

Now it does not get programmed like the more expensive ones but it will hit all of your key areas. Just make sure you set it up for success and move things out of its way that would cause it to get stuck. The dust compartment should be cleaned after every session or two depending on how much debris you typically have on your floors. I have mine on a scheduled timer every other day and it maintains my downstairs in between our busy work schedules. And it was worth the cost we paid.

B0CNKX4429,5,"OK, so I only used it one time, BUT I LOVE her so far!","Our ""Ruth the Roomba"" was the ""used like new"" one (only $116!). She ran 2 hours (yep, 2 hours!). She missed a spot, but it was an entry way rug, so I just ran the vacuum over it. Our plan is to run her daily. We have an English Setter dog and a calico cat (lots of hair shedding). We live in the woods so we also bring in a lot of debris. We have hardwood floors with some area rugs. I had to empty her THREE times during this first run. I used the app to pause the sweep, and then I resumed it with the app after emptying. We had not ran a vacuum in a few days, so I was not surprised. I highly recommend emptying frequently, especially for the first few runs, and then run her daily. Will update if something changes over the next month as we run her daily. My sister has one (Rosie), and she vacuums by hand weekly in the corners. I do not know if I will need to do that or not with this model (I do not know her model). PS. I advise running her only while at home. Ours was hung up on a metal piece in our flush to the floor walk-in colonial fireplace in our kitchen, and we had to intervene. That was the only obstacle. We made sure all wires/cords etc were off of the floors before we ran her.","Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2023"
B0CNKX4429,5,This thing saves us so much time in routine cleaning.,This was a great purchase. I don't know why we waited so long to get it. It saves us so much time daily! We have a few very hairy pets that constantly leave hair around the floor even with routine brushing. It would constantly be picked up by our socks as we walk around the house. My wife would spend an hour or so each day with a broom on our hardwood floors trying to keep up with it. I bought this to hopefully save her from having to spend that time sweeping up every day and it has paid off immensely. We set the robot up and set it to clean for an hour and a half. It is fairly loud (hopefully they are working on a silent motor version which I would buy immediately). It will randomly move about the house and clean. If it comes to an obstacle it will lightly bump it and correct its course to get around it. Eventually it will cover the whole floor from what I have been able to tell. If it comes to a step ledge it will sense it and turn around as well. Once its cleaning interval is complete it will return to its base to recharge. I could not believe how much dirt and hair this thing would pick up daily!

B0CNKX4429,5,Pretty good vacuum,"She found the dirtiest spot in my apartment, the front mat, right away. Some of the reviews said this Roomba was dumb, but I think she's pretty good. My place was pretty dusty because I've been depressed, but she picked up a ton of hair and dust after only 15 minutes, and you can definitely tell the difference underfoot. I did have to clean the hair out from underneath because I shed a lot, but that's to be expected. It was fun to watch her go. She had a bit of trouble finding ""home"" when it was time to stop, but I just headed her off until she found out. She did not hurt my bare feet, she could sense my toes and did fine with cords. She may be a bit of a trip hazard, so watch out for that. She's not as loud as a regular vacuum, so I can get the house clean when I'm up late at night without waking up the neighbors. She's big enough that she didn't get stuck on anything, she was able to navigate around weird spaces. She did run over a puddle that I didn't know was there from watering my plants, but she didn't seem to be too wet and I'll let her dry out before next use. She did great on both the carpet and the vinyl in the kitchen. She got a little stuck on the transition strip between flooring, but she was able to get free without help.

B0CNKX4429,5,Still works great,"purchased the iRobot Roomba 694 Robot Vacuum approximately six months ago, and I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance. This robot vacuum offers several features that make it a valuable addition to any home. Performance: The Roomba 694 does an excellent job of cleaning both pet hair and various floor surfaces, including carpets and hard floors. Its cleaning patterns are efficient, and it can navigate around obstacles and tight spaces with ease. The Wi-Fi connectivity and compatibility with Alexa allow for convenient control, scheduling, and personalized cleaning recommendations. Value for Money: While robot vacuums can be an investment, the Roomba 694 offers good value for the price. Its ability to maintain clean floors with minimal manual effort justifies the cost. Durability: After six months of consistent use, the Roomba 694 has proven to be durable. It continues to operate reliably without showing signs of wear or malfunction. Self-Charging: The self-charging feature is a great convenience. After each cleaning cycle, it returns to its docking station, ensuring it's always ready for the next cleaning session. Overall, the iRobot Roomba 694 Robot Vacuum has made a positive impact on my household. It effectively handles pet hair and different flooring types, offers smart features like Wi-Fi connectivity, and has proven to be a reliable and durable appliance.

B0CNKX4429,5,Great house cleaning assistant!,"I’ve had this roomba for about a week now and it is working great! We have 6 kids and 2 dogs so the floor is always a mess. It does a great job cleaning the family room, kitchen and hallway on the main floor of the house. Whatever it reaches it has cleaned up with now issues besides large items like pens or pencils. Suction is good and it transitions between the hard floor and carpet pretty well. Some cons would be it can only vacuum what it can reach, so spot cleaning is still required for small nooks and crannies. For our large family, the cleaning trap fills up fast and needs to be emptied frequently. It also does not have floor mapping so it will go under our dining room table and bounce of the chair and table legs 20 times before it finds its way out which can be annoying if you are not used to the constant background noise that is always present in a large family. Overall a great pickup and cleaning assistant while the kids are in school. I would recommend to others and buy again.","Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2023"

It's kind of hard to follow and its pattern seems to be quite random. However, it picked up quite a lot of hair from floors and carpets. (We have one cat and each time we use it, the chamber gets filled up with orange cat hair.). After running it a few times, I've noticed that although it still seems random, and other times, it will go straight back a hallway and turn on a dime to go into a bathroom, without bumping into anything! Quite impressive! I was also concerned that it might get stuck somewhere, which it has. However when this happens, it realizes that it's stuck says that there is an error and stops. This has only happened once, but it was nice to know that it shuts off rather than constantly trying to run. Wonderful purchase!

When returning home it is back on it's base recharging and the rooms where it has been cleaning are actually clean. I am totally impressed with the amount of dirt, dust and debris it has collected. The hardwood floors actually look like they've be polished! Once it got stuck and it shut down because I had not covered a space that was too small for it, and another time it jammed because of a length of string i missed picking up which got wound up in it's brushes.

B0CNKX4429,5,Best money spent,"I love it! The sensors on it are great! It doesn’t get caught on dumb things like the knock off version I bought. It rolls right over cords instead of stucking them up. It transitions really well from hardwood floors to carpet. Let’s be honest it’s not perfect and doesn’t always pick up everything but it does 90% of the job and eventually will get what it missed. It is a little noisy I will say, but definitely less noisy than a regular vacuum. I even had a tummy time play mat and thought for sure it would get stuck but no, it rolled right over it just fine. And it adjusts itself to roll over or under things when needed so it’s not just a one surface kind of thing. I constantly have mine on because of my babies and toddler dropping their snacks everywhere. It even pushed out of the way a Nerf gun bullet that my kid left out. again, I thought that was gonna get stuck for sure. If this sucker ever goes out, I’m definitely getting another one. I do recommend getting more filters because it only comes with one extra. Although I don’t know if it makes its way back to the charging port on its own yet because I usually stop it before it gets to that point.

B0CNKX4429,5,Worth it,"To start with - I use to have a roomba many years ago and I loved it, but it just couldn’t handle thick carpet, it was best on hardwood floor only. I recently decided I wanted to get a roomba again and I decided to get this model despite some of the complaints on here. Now some of these complaints I just find ridiculous. My last roomba was somewhat noisy too, what do you expect, it’s a vacuum. Obviously it’s not going to be silent. I find it no more noisy than my last one. This one is a major improvement over my previous model. This one can go from carpet to hardwood no problem. It only got stuck on the room divider once for trying to go over it at a weird angle. The sweeper on the roomba is very good at getting dander which a vacuum will not pick up, it would just be stuck there. So the roomba is doing two jobs in one. Sweeping and vacuuming. Yes, the roomba does seem to miss spots on each run, but I can always run it again. It’s still better than me trying to sweep and vacuum. Because let’s be honest. I don’t want to. Honestly, I think it’s worth the money. Just be realistic with your expectations. It’s a robot. Not your maid.","Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2023"

B0CNKX4429,5,Impressed!,"I have the roomba i3+ (Bob) for our upstairs, and I have been wanting another roomba for our downstairs. Our dog kennel is downstairs and so is the litter box. We don’t use the basement that often, so it’s easy to forget about cleaning down there. The dog hair and the litter builds up on the carpet and the tile pretty quickly. I didn’t want to spend another $400-500 for just the basement, so I decided to go with this roomba (Jerry). It doesn’t have all the bells and whistles like Bob - like the self empty, dual-rubber brushes, mapping, and cleaning in straight rows, so I was worried I wouldn’t like it. But, after it’s first round of cleaning, I was pleasantly surprised! Jerry ran for 49 minutes using half the battery and filled the bin with litter, hair, and debris. Although the self-empty feature is nicer, it was easy to dump out the bin, and it was fun to see what it picked up. It actually picked up the litter better than Bob does and it ran a lot quieter. The only downfall is that it doesn’t show you the map of where it cleaned, and with the random cleaning pattern, you can’t guarantee it cleaned the whole space, but that’s fine for a space we don’t use often. I have it set to run every morning and I’m excited that it will help keep our house clean without any effort on my end other than emptying the bin every day, which I’ll do when we scoop the litter box in the morning. I also like that you can easily switch between both Roombas in the app to control them.","Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2022"
B0CNKX4429,5,Buy Something Else,"We bought this for our house a few years ago to help with the pet hair problem. Lucky for us, we came across this little puppy that cleans the same spots over and over until the battery dies. Leaving us with only 3/4 of the house to clean ourselves! We love that the pet hair is still a problem, but we will gladly take the cords that are in the outlets instead! Once it’s done cleaning the few spots it’s chosen for the day, it dies before getting back to the charging port and sends us on a witch hunt to find it. Best part is, it usually decides to die underneath a bed or desk so it’s harder to recover. It also claims that “rugs are no match”, that’s right! Rugs aren’t a match for myself or our pets, but nearly kills the iRobot when it comes across one. Every time it comes across our rugs, it stops, chimes for hours, and claims it’s stuck near a cliff. Our favorite part is the charging port that stopped working two weeks after we purchased the item. It only takes 5-7 minutes to find the right placement and begin charging for the next job! If you’re looking to continue cleaning the house yourself but decided today was the day to spend an extra $250 for a product that doesn’t work, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023"
B0CNKX4429,5,It has it’s quirks,"This is a very unique product. Having two huskies in the house , there is plenty of loose fur all over the floor. This vacuum seems to be keeping up with the task. Is this vacuum perfect? No. It will get stuck in the most random of places (under the dining room chair, between the area rug and the couch or against the sliding glass door). If you are looking for Rosie the Robot from the Jetsons, keep looking, however, if you can deal with a few quirks that this unit has, this is a great addition especially if you have a busy household and don’t have the ability to vacuum everyday (husky owners). This vacuum does not work in a grid pattern, and the pattern it does work in seems to be pretty random, which means my dogs think that this thing is viciously chasing and attacking them every morning when it starts its routine. It takes an adjustment period to get used to how this operates, and how the furry family members in your home adjust to the whirling circle monster that seems to chase them from room to room. For the sale price that I picked up this unit for I would certainly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2023"
B0CNKX4429,5,Better than I expected,"I bought this with hopes of it sweeping the kitchen floor so we would just have to mop. I didn’t want to spend a ton of money on one that has all the extra features either. The Roomba 694 doesn’t empty itself, it doesn’t do mapping or have a big wide path. But this little guy is a worker! First of all it goes right over the transition from our tile kitchen into our shag carpet living room no problem. It bumps into objects and turns. But it seems way smarter than it should be, it goes along edges, pivots around under the table and chairs. It gets into places we can’t usually sweep, like under our aquarium stand. We got a small cat so don’t have a big pet hair problem but my wife cuts hair for a living and this thing cleans her tracks and doesn’t seem to mind the cat toys much either, though I do try to pick em up before sending the Roomba out. I thought for sure it’d need emptied before the battery ran out but nope, it hasn’t. And emptying it and maintaining the brushes is super easy. I use a letter opener to cut the hair off the brushes. Since it’s out working by itself I usually dump it into a grocery bag and look at what it collected, still do cause I found a puzzle piece once. I’m really happy with my purchase and would absolutely recommend this product to a friend.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2023"
B0CNKX4429,5,Good Entry Level Roomba @ A Great Price!,"Play Video Ok first off, this is an entry level unit. It does have WiFi connectivity that allows basic control & limited programming. You can schedule when it cleans and for how long. You can use a 3rd party application that will command the roomba to start cleaning when you leave your residence and to return to its charging base when you return home automatically. The roomba app will tell you about the service and provide directions for use. The app allows you to tell roomba to return to its charging station (not a direct route). This may take a few minutes or longer but it will find its way “home”. While this is an entry level unit, it cleans very well! This is my 2nd roomba. The first one was purchased 8 or 9 years ago for nearly $400 and had no WiFi or remote control capabilities. I run them both together. They are a cleaning Terror! I mean that in a good way. They do a great job cleaning floor and carpet. Tall/thick area rugs may present a challenge and require the roomba to approach from an angle to “climb” the edge but they will eventually success in most cases. For the price, this unit is a no-brainer. The newest unit is quieter and runs longer than the old unit. As I indicated, the old unit is nine years old and I have replaced the battery about three times and it’s running strong. The batteries continue to drop in price. The last replacement was a about $30. So the dynamic duo work great as a team! Purchase one! You will be shocked at the dirt it will find and clean, Especially under beds! Buy one, I think you’ll be very happy!","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2022"

B0CNKX4429,5,Has saved me so much time,"It took me several years to agree to spend the money on one of these. We have 2 dogs that shed a lot plus a toddler with hair past her waist. It gets up about 90% of the hair and dirt on the floor. It does do better on the hardwood and tile than on the rug and carpet. I usually have to block it into the area with the rug to get a decent clean and have to manually put it on that side of the room. For some reason it still defaults to only wanting to clean to the right of its base. But all in all I love it. It’s saved me so much time. I was vacuuming 2-5 times a day between the dog hair, kids messes and occasional dirt that came out of a plant my digs knock off the windowsill. Our allergies have all improved and I love that I can tell it to start cleaning while I’m out and about and come home to a freshly vacuumed home. As a stay at home mom who’s husband is on nights this is a must have. It’s also very quiet compared to our bissel and Dyson upright vacuums (it doesn’t wake him up or my toddler when I run it at night) and in my opinion has done better at cleaning the floor than the bissel ever did. If you’re on the fence about getting one it’s worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2022"
B0CNKX4429,5,Should have got one years ago~ Shame on me.,"This is one of those ""man I should have bought this earlier"" things. It works awesome but lemme tell you, this sucker will get in a vicious fight and will fight to the end with any charger cords, speaker or bath room rugs left down where it can get to it, or at least mine has anyway~ Took couple operations to teach me to pick them all up on scheduled days. Apparently it also likes to work its way under the recliner which is just high enough to not trip the turn around sensor, but too low for the machine to ease under it and back out so it will diligently dig its way almost all the way under it and get its little sassy nomad self stuck. Oh, one more thing, 99% of the time when the battery gets low, it does in fact make its way back the the charger like it is supposed to HOWEVER, I have learned that when it gets pooped out in the fights it picks, you might have to go into ""wheres waldo"" hunting for it. So if you make it by my place, pay no mind to the shoes scattered about blocking off the portals where it likes to go in to UFC cage match mode. All kidding aside, well worth the $$$ and as the headline says, I should have got one way earlier.","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2022"
B0CNKX4429,5,"Works great, gets almost everything!","Things I like about this Roomba: - It automatically cleans on a schedule - It automatically docks itself when needing to recharge - You can control everything from the app - You can start/stop jobs even when not at home - It picks up most things Things I do not like: - It doesn't get everything, but that's to be expected - It doesn't remember the floor layout, so it is always bumping into things.. although it's a gentle bump (the i6+ and s9+ models do map the floor) - You have to empty the dust pan/tray every few times; I wish the tray was a little bigger - It doesn't detect cords very well; I had to buy a virtual wall barrier for near my computer equipment; otherwise you could just put something in the way to block it Overall I'm very happy with the purchase. After I ran it for a week and changed the tray several times, I realized, ""wow, I should have vacuumed more!"". This is one of those ""set it and forget it"" products, which is awesome.

B0CNKX4429,4,"Good Performance, But the Brush Broke Too Soon","I’ve been using my iRobot Roomba for about a year now, and while it’s been great for cleaning—especially for daily upkeep and pet hair—I'm a bit disappointed that the brush broke after just one year of use. It worked perfectly fine for the first several months, and the suction and navigation are still solid, but the side brush snapped off, and now it doesn’t clean as thoroughly in corners or along edges. Replacing the brush is an extra cost, and it’s frustrating that a key part of the vacuum wore out so quickly. That said, the Roomba still works well overall, and I love how it keeps my floors relatively clean without much effort from me. If you’re willing to replace the brushes occasionally, the Roomba is a great tool. Just keep in mind that some parts might not last as long as you’d expect, especially with regular use.","Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,Good as an introduction to the Roomba family.,"I live in an apartment with vinyl floors and was shocked at how quickly dirt, dust, and debris piled up. Sweeping felt like a full-time job. Enter the Roomba Essentials, my new cleaning buddy. It’s definitely not perfect, but it sure beats sweeping every. single. day. I picked up the Roomba Essentials as an introduction to the world of Roomba, fully intending to upgrade later. As long as you know this isn’t the most advanced Roomba, you’ll manage your expectations and won’t be too frustrated by the occasional hiccup. First off, its main job is to relieve you from daily vacuuming or sweeping duties, and it does just that. It connects to your smartphone, allowing you to start it, set a schedule, and send it home. It also gives you a handy map of where it’s been, so you can keep tabs on whether it missed a certain spot. It also comes with Google and Alexa functionality, so you can talk to your voice assistant and have it begin a job at your command. But it won’t learn your home’s layout like the pricier models. You’ll still need to do a little prep work by clearing the floors: cords, shoes, or anything it might mistake for a light snack need to be hidden. Trust me, it has a weird appetite for power cords and phone chargers. . . . It mostly manages to avoid big things like baseboards, doors, and anything low enough for it to sense directly in front of it. But when it comes to low hanging edges like the underside of the kitchen cabinets, or a piece of furniture with too low of clearance while still being strangely high enough to avoid its sensors? It’s more of a ‘bump and hope for the best’ kind of strategy. I’ve watched it play demolition derby with all sorts of different pieces of furniture or obstacles more times than I can count. But it's never aggressive enough to mark anything up or cause any damage. Despite the occasional confusion, it handles my 2-bedroom, 2-bath apartment pretty well, and the battery lasts plenty long enough to finish the job on the highest suction level, assuming it doesn’t get stuck in some bizarre nook and cranny... On the plus side, it’s quiet – much quieter than your standard upright vacuum. The only time it really raises its voice is to let you know it’s stuck or when it’s taken up that new hobby as a furniture boxer. iRobot makes maintenance super easy. There are guides and repair manuals in the app, which is great. But replacement parts aren’t exactly cheap. The app will also tell you when something needs replacing, so you’re not guessing when to switch out a part. If you’re expecting miracles, this little guy might fall a bit short. It’s the slightly more clumsy, budget-friendly cousin of the Roomba family. . .But if you’re looking for a reliable assistant to cut down on your daily sweeping and vacuuming, the Essentials does the job, quirks and all. Just be prepared for it to have a few ""learning moments"" along the way. . . .","Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,4,Works well but won't connect to app,"This robot vacuum works well! If you're considering buying one, here's a brief pro/con list: Pro: -You can just turn it on and off it goes! It's really handy to be able to go about your day and just have the vacuum zooming around the home doing the chore for you. -Small! It's not super large or bulky so it can fit literally anywhere in the home. I currently have it sitting in my living room since it's not in the way of anything. -More quiet than a traditional vacuum! Compared to regular vacuums this one is fairly quiet and doesn't disturb the home environment as much, and also may not scare your pets (I have 2 cats who aren't phased by it whereas with other vacuums my cats were terrified of them). Con: -This particular model of iRobot doesn't connect to the app (at least mine didn't, so you may encounter this as well). You don't need the app, to be completely honest, but it IS helpful. -You HAVE to make sure ALL ITEMS are off the floor! As cool as this little robot is, it's not a genius. It can and will suck up anything that's on your floor, including cords, loose carpet fibers, etc. -It's not THAT smart! While it does a generally good job of vacuuming, it's not perfect. In my opinion, if you're wanting some general spot cleaning, this is perfect. However, if you're needing more specific cleaning (like a mess on the carpet), the traditional vacuum is the way to go. I WOULD NOT get rid of your traditional vacuum, just keep it handy for when you need it (like vacuuming the stairs or something). -The BIGGEST con in my opinion--the size of the dust bin. Obviously, it's much smaller than that of your traditional vacuum, so it needs to be emptied much more frequently. Depending on the amount of traffic in your home and if you have any pets, and also how often you vacuum, this could mean cleaning it out almost every single use.

B0CNKX4429,4,Surprised by ease of setup and performance,"We got this during an Amazon lightning deal and glad we did, it's our first robot vacuum. Setup was simple and the unit came about 50% charged to got it started right away. Push-buttons on the unit work well if you don't want to bother with the App on your cell phone. There's no pattern when it operates, just seems to go all over the place but, after about 60 minutes, seemed to have covered just about everywhere. It's just over 3-inches high so easily went under the chairs and couches but was about an inch too high to go under the coffee and end tables to will be looking for something to raise those up just a bit. A dresser has two openings in the front and it did manage to go underneath there and, after a few minutes, actually found it's way back out...so that's good. Quieter than we expected and debris bin is very easy to remove, open, and dump into the trash can. It's not the biggest thing so if you have a large or dirty area might have to empty often. We have a mini-Aussi dog with fine hair and after first use had quite a bit of hair wrapped around the spinner brush and wheel but was easy to cut out. (Probably from getting lots of hair from underneath the dresser.) On the first use, I had the App all setup and noticed the battery getting very low so sent the ""return to base"" command which it acknowledged. But it was in the bedroom so continued to work around there, then it went into the living room, then back to the bedroom (the charge is in the dining room.) It eventually stopped and would say ""battery is low"" until I picked it up and put onto the charger. Seemed to be fully charged within a few hours. Pros: Inexpensive ($159 on sale), super easy setup, quiet, debris bin very easy to empty, and all moving parts (except wheels) are very easy to take off, clean, and replace, even the brushes. Never got stuck, even when in a very tight area like between two kitchen tables or underneath a dresser, eventually wriggled its way out. Cons: Debris bin isn't very big so larger/dirtier areas will need the bin emptied often. A little too high to go underneath our coffee table and end tables so will have to figure out a way to raise them up an inch or so to let it get under those. Wouldn't want it to smear anything wet around so will have to only use manually, never on a set time schedule. Overall: Glad we got this and mini-Aussi seems mesmerized by it so follows it around (but doesn't bark at it, which is good.)","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2023"
B0CNKX4429,4,Good if you have pets,"PROS: 1) suction is fairly impressive for this small machine. Picks up hair, dust, crumbs, scrap pieces of thread and material (I sew and quilt). 2) Pretty quiet, a LOT less noisy than a regular vacuum. There's a constant buzz that one can get used to fairly easily. Can still easily hear the radio or TV at normal volume levels. 3) Didn't scare the dogs too much b/c it wasn't too noisy, although they were very curious and followed it around for the first few times I had it running. 4) Easy set up and use: Plug it in, charge it up (give it at least a couple hours to charge completely), press the button and let it go. 5) Doesn't snag on small floor mats/carpets. Puppy pads I lay out does get crunched up a bit, but at least it doesn't stop the Rumba and cause me to redirec it. Rumba figures out it's not something to be sucked up and turns around to continue on. 6) Pretty easy to clean (i.e. removing the parts and getting out the hairs and debris took about 1-2 minutes (I like to clean all the hairs from the bristle brush and rubber brush on the bottom of the machine) Dog fur will get caught in the moving parts so cleaning it all out I think would prolong the life of your Rumba. CONS: 1) Should clean it out every time it's used. Depending on how large your home is that the Rumba has to cover and how much it has to suck up, the bin gets full pretty quickly. 2) Rumba doesn't seem to stop. I had it running for over 2 hours, but it never decided it was done and returned on its own to it's docking station. I had to physically pick it up and return it to the docking station.

After doing some research I settled on this basic model of roomba. It cannot map the room like the higher priced models, so I need to close the door to keep it contained in the spaces I want it to clean. But clean it does. It handles a full sized dining room and a half sized kitchen in 45 minutes. The app is easy to use and generally helpful when you encounter problems. Meanwhile the roomba itself is easy to maintain and does a great job cleaning hard wood floors and area rugs. There are some issues however. This roomba is tenacious about cleaning dirt and will wedge itself under furniture trying to reach it. You'll have to roomba-proof your space. It also hits things - hard! It's pushed a small wine rack around and nearly knocked the bottles out! There is also a known issue with the roomba disconnecting from wifi, which can be restored by rebooting the router and/or the roomba.

B0CNKX4429,4,"It is a vacuum that really gets the job done well, but software is very unreliable","First, I will say that we love the vacuum results. This thing is a true workhorse. We have it scheduled to run twice a week in two large rooms and are very satisfied with the results. The first few times it ran for close to 90 minutes as it made up for the inadequate job of our push vacuum. Now, with our twice-weekly schedule, it can cover its territory in about 45 minutes and everything looks great. We only run it on carpet so cannot speak to its hard surface ability. BUT - it is not as hands off as expected. The software is very unreliable. We have a schedule set through the phone app, that the iRobot may or may not choose to follow. We have had the vacuum start 2 hours early, 1 hour early, and even start on a non-scheduled day. Don't know how this happens, but it may have something to do with its wi-fi connection. The vacuum sometimes fails to return before the battery runs down. This doesn't happen every time so we don't know what triggers it to continue to run until the battery is drained and what triggers it to return home because the battery is low. At the point that the battery may be drained, the vacuuming chore is essentially complete so it is only a problem that it needs to be retrieved and placed back on its base. The worst, however, is that 2 of the 3 spinning side brush arms have already broken off after just a few uses. The replacement part is $15 and currently out of stock. Time will tell if this is an important enough feature to continue to replace. Overall, we got the unit so that my 92-year old mother does not have to push a vacuum, and she absolutely loves it. It does a very good job as a vacuum and the other features are not deal breakers for us at all.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,"Just ok, doesn’t run very long on a full charge or maybe my expectations were too high","The Roomba has its challenges. I’ll list them here: doesn’t get into all the corners you wish it would; it runs for about 30 minutes or less on a full charge so if you have a lot to clean up during a specific time of the day, you’ll be disappointed that have to keep charging it before you can continue, so it takes longer than I like for it to take. Also, pet hair and human hair will get stuck in the roller mechanism. If you don’t clean that out consistently, it will get stuck in the machine annd affect how well your Roomba continues to work.","Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,Works fairly well,"3 day review of the Roomba Model 694... I'll start by saying I was wrong not to have bought one years ago. I 'assumed' that they couldnt work all that well, and that they couldnt be heavy/beefy enough, to accomplish much on carpet. Hard floor? Sure, carpet, I held serious doubts. Got it Sunday afternoon: 3 hrs charging: SUN: two circuits of the house; filled the self contained hamper MON: 3 circuits...the 3 combined picked up about the same as 1st circuit on Sunday TUE: 2 circuits, combined pickup...maybe 1/3 of what got picked up Monday. I closed the bathroom doors. The little rugs in the bathroom, cause it to get stuck under the toekick of the vanity cabinets. You DO need to pickup before you run it. Shoes, power cords etc, can cause it issues. It can run up on a shoe and get stuck; it can suck up shoe laces and get hungup, it can can suck up loose extension cords and get caught up. So you do have to take some precautions. Effectiveness on a scale of 1 to 10 comparing it to an upright high quality vacuum being a 9 or 10: This is a 5 or 6 Convenience: Insane. It will happily chug along while you take a nap. While it wont pick up like an upright, you dont have to operate it like one either. You CAN run it, let it recharge, run it again, let it recharge and run it again. I would say what it picks up then, is similar to what you would have gotten with a careful and thorough vacuuming with a hefty upright. The gain to the user is; you'll spend a grand total of 5 minutes MAYBE, manually doing anything with the roomba. You can be reading, cooking, baking, studying, bathing, walking, ANYTHING you want to do, while it runs...provided you picked up the area properly beforehand. 4 stars out of 5 cuase I havent managed to get the app to recognize the unit yet, so I cant remotely start it via the app.","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2023"

B0CNKX4429,4,Wonderful daily cleaner!,"Pros: -Gets hardwood surfaces and the corners swept up. Does gets most of the long pet hair up off of the rug too. -Despite it's random wandering, it does get everything picked up over time. -Gets over uneven surfaces well without getting stuck. -It's super handy for the spot cleaning feature. -Not heavy. -Wonderful for the elderly and for busy bodies. -Goes back to it's charger every time unless it got stuck somewhere. (I block off all the spaces it can just barely get under with a board to prevent this. It scratched itself very badly trying to get back out from under my couch unfortunately.) -Works wonders on picking up cat litter and cat hair. Even those soft hairballs that tend to get kicked up from a vacuum gets picked up from this guy. -If there ever is an error, a chime folled by a female voice will announce the error for you. It's very helpful to know what to fix and get it back to business again. -BE PATIENT. If it finds a bar stool, sometimes it takes a long while for it to wander back out. BUT IT WILL WANDER ITS WAY BACK OUT. Don't be impatient with it. If you are still having this issue, when I vaccum I pick up my chairs and flip them upsidedown on top my table while letting it clean. I can mop afterwards doing it this way. -Friendly for non-tech people. I do not use the app. Eeverything it does can be done manually. -Doesnt do everything the expensive ones do, but it still cleans everything well. In the sense, I think its very valuable. Cons -Slighty noisy, but definitely not as loud as a vacuum. Cowardly cats aren't scared of it anymore. They even sleep through it's cycle now. -It will not sense ""objects"" infront of it like cords or toys. Take your time to pick up around the house before you turn this on! It will run over everything you leave. - Since it wanders, it will wonder it's way under your feet often throughout the clean cycle at some point. For example, try and to block off your kitchen if you're cooking at the same time, it can be a trip hazzard. -Clean the debris trap daily! However, that does beat doing the vacuuming every day though. -Clean the bristles every week! Again, you'd do this if you were vaccuming anyways. -It makes it back it's base, but somehow, sometimes I go to start a cycle, and it's dead. I believe it either gets bumped by my pets, or it didn't successfully land on the charging pad well. It's fairly uncommon when this happens. -Somehow, the door for the debris trap comes open during a cycle sometimes. It makes a loud announcement over it's error. I think it might be from running over uneven floor surfaces, like room divider boards.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2022"

B0CNKX4429,4,Godsend for Pethair,"After moving into a home with no carpet and hardwood/tile, I learned how badly cat hair accumulated on the floors, especially with multiple cats. (Seriously, it's atrocious.) I was a bit iffy with the reviews, but I decided to give this model a go as a cheaper option to try. So far it has worked great at keeping the pet hair under control. It doesn't do any kind of mapping, so can be a bit repetitive or random in how it gets the job done, sometimes skipping over a spot several times in a row, but even with that flaw, it really does a good job keeping pet hair at sane levels and that's really all I need. I went from having to sweep 1-2 a day down to a quick vacuum before mopping each week, so it's been a huge time saver. I do have to empty the bin every 2-3 sessions and give the brushes a quick clean (mostly because of my own long hair, not really a pet hair issue), but it takes just a few minutes so it's not very much maintenance so far. Overall, if you're not looking for something high end and just need some day to day help with pet hair and dust, it works really well and I would recommend it if you catch it on sale.","Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,"Basic robot vacuum, very user friendly","It is one of the cheapest Roomba, but it does fine with basic dusting and carpet cleaning. Very easy to set up and use. It bounces around after it encounters obstacle so no exact cleaning pattern, but it will eventually clean the area. You can move it to a specific dirty area and do spot cleaning, and that's a nice feature. I especially like the fact that it can clean under my bed and cabinets which my upright vacuum cannot do. I am very happy with it and hope it will last a long time. PS: I have to move some cluttered stuff off the floor before I start vacuuming if I want a more complete cleaning of the whole area, but you do the same with an upright vacuum also.","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,convenient for general cleaning,"Good for general cleaning. Does not clean corners or under sofas. I end up doing a bit more vacuuming with the regular vacuum with the skinny wand.

B0CNKX4429,4,Handy little device,"I like that it helps vacuum my floor when its needed by using Alexa to get it started. With over 100 jobs done by this device i've decided to give a review on it. Firstly setting up the device with the app was very easy the app itself is simple to use e.g. setting schedules or create a custom run times getting alerts if there is a problem with the vacuum and also when a cleaning job has been completed. when in operation its not too loud to disturb you and it cleans very well however wished it had a bit more suction power, It has cleaned my vinyl flooring with no issues also carpeted flooring in my house cleaning area is approx 1500 sqft. The only down side with this unit is emptying the dust collecting bin it can get a bit messy however thats a minor problem because this unit allows me the time to do other things while the floor is being cleaned its not one of the higher end models with the floor mapping and row cleaning its more of a random cleaning that bumps and turns as it goes it does miss spots however i run it for a longer time which overcomes that issue the battery run time is very good it easily gets 1 hr 45 mins there were a few instances where it run as long as 1 hr 55 mins thats because it took longer to dock into its charging station. Cleaning the unit is easy i clean the brushes and the sensor once a week to keep the vacuum running at it best performance. I do recommend this handy little helper ! I'll update this review when it completes 200 jobs. Update 16th April 2023 What can I say this vacuum completed over 200 jobs this updated review is quite simple IT WORKS as intended the battery life after 200 jobs is still very good hopefully it can make it to 300 jobs I’ll update my review when it does but in the mean time I like how the app reminds you when it’s time to change the worn out brushes, it all depends on the type so surface being used on. The wear and tear will be different however on my application they are in still good shape and does not affect its performance I had however changed the dust filter as it’s efficiency reduced a bit.","Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2022"
B0CNKX4429,4,"Loud, only one side brush, no control","After having a no name robot vacuum that was performing well I decided to get another one for my second floor. In comparison to my cheaper no name vac, I’ve been disappointed. It is loud to the point of waking people up if sleeping, not able to hear tv, annoying my dog and just wants me to send it home … speaking of home .. it can’t find home unless you encourage it by getting it 3-5’ away. I use it on hardwoods and not carpet / rugs. My no name lets you control the speed of brushes / suction but this has absolutely no control except to turn it on or send it home. My no name was cheaper and also has two side brushes that work together and observing the two leads me to believe iRobot has created way too many models with tiny differences and different compatible parts and in doing so harmed the brand.","Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,Cleans well when it manages to get there,"Good: Cleans well where it manages to go. I have a high shed dog and used to have socks caked with dog hair while still vacuuming twice a day. Got this and my home is noticeably less gross. But, for the cost it isn't really a good value due to its navigation. Bad: No pattern control and poor user guide / minimal function to the app. I hate the random cleaning method this does and wish it had a normal back and forth feature so that it would get everywhere. It definitely doesn't and somehow manages to run the same 'random' route every day... So there are some high traffic spots right near it's dock that it just about always missed. Annoying: It can't figure out how to re-dock itself even within clear view and close to its docking station. It also has a pretty tiny dust bin that fills up daily for me (and never empties all the way. I have to get my other vacuum to clean off the clump of dog hair that gets stuck to the filter every day.)","Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,"Great starter roomba, not very smart","Pros: Cleans carpet and hardwood great, it even detects large pieces and does a little circle to make sure it gets it. It was able to climb from the floor onto a thick carpet, and over door thresholds. The suction is actually really good, and the little spinning sweeper helps it out with corners and the edges. The run time is about 1.5hrs, and it can get all the big areas of our house, but bedrooms, dining room need a touch up with the actual vacuum. Cons: this thing is the cheapest iRobot branded vacuum, so don’t expect much. It’s not laser guided, ai enhanced like the expensive ones, it has a sensor on top and the front is a big button that gets pressed when it bumps into things. You have to clean up a little bit before you run it, because it gets cought on charging cords, string, paper, basically anything the size of a straw is going to jam it up. It also struggles to find its home, when you end its job, it keeps cleaning until it gets within 5 feet of the base, then docks itself. The pattern is very random, and it just kinda bounces from wall to wall, so it’s not very efficient. Overall it’s a great little machine, it’s definitely cut down the amount of cleaning we have to do, and it’s good if you want to try it out without buying a 900 roomba or a crappy Chinese one","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,"Ok entry level, has annoying quirks, gets ""stuck"" OFTEN","While this seems to be a great entry level not vacuum, the most frustrating thing I've experienced is that it gets stuck in corners and can't seem to find it's way out, or it will get caught on something odd. You can't leave it to run while away because of these quirks. It won't find it's way home if the base is in another room either. Cleaning wise it has done a decent job and I'm very satisfied with that. It's not quiet by any means, minor annoyance. It's quieter than a regular upright and louder than a small fan. Will update as time progresses. Update 11/08/22: photo added where it got stuck, twice, in a corner with plenty of room and open space, with app telling me it was ""at the edge of a cliff"". Oookay. It's like a child, you can't leave it alone. I'm now looking into other brands and seriously considering returning it. I don't want to babysit this thing. Update 111622: I did end up returning it to get the upgraded J7 that has mapping features. That's what I wanted in the first place but I was not well enough informed. I ended up purchasing from Bestbuy because what I see a lot in the reviews here at Amazon are a lot of ""did I get a dud"" or a lot of ""it was fine until a month later"" which indicated to me that Amazon is not handling returns correctly. Or simply sending out returns without proper testing in order to turn that profit. I don't see very many of those kind of reviews elsewhere. I think the problem is Amazon, not the manufacturer. I do like the j7 a lot better with the mapping features. It is a lot more quiet than this model as well. It doesn't get stuck either. That little Dobby will fight with the obstacle until it's unstuck.","Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2022"

B0CNKX4429,4,Very good with some quirks,"I waited to jump on the robot vacuum train for a few generations as I wanted to make sure the $$ I spent would not be spent on beta software. While it is clear that we are beyond beta, it is also clear that I did not get the top of the line model. It does a very good job of cleaning. The phone app is easy to use and schedule different cleaning times. I was hoping to have it run at night after we've gone to bed, but it is way to loud for that! It is not as loud as a regular push vacuum, but louder than I expected. I typically have it run when I'm in the home office with my headphones on. My biggest frustration is that there seems to be no rhyme or reason to how to moves around to clean. It just bounces off objects and moves around with no pattern or plan. It won't ""learn"" where the stairs are, so it is always getting ""stuck at the edge of a cliff"". I'm still under 10 cleaning sessions, but so far it has not successfully found its way back to its charging station on its own. I usually get an alert that it has run out of battery on its way back to base and then go find it and manually place it on the charger.

B0CNKX4429,4,Works ok,"I waited a long time to be able to buy a robot vacuum cleaner, so when this model went on sale during Prime Day, I was thrilled. It truly is my little helper around the house. It’s easy to open to empty and clean and sits in its charging port quietly until re-activated. My only complaint is that it doesn’t seem to complete a room in a grid. The robot seemingly roams at random and will cover the same spaces over and over again without moving to another area. I have to give it a little push to start a new room section. In the hallway, it turns around and comes back with only half the hallway completed. Go figure. Since this robot was one I could afford, I’m happy to have it.

B0CNKX4429,4,Great to have have to vacuum,"We were torn on getting this one vs one of the higher end models but after reading many reviews, decided on this model. Setup of the unit itself was simple enough as it was basically a plug/play setup with no assembly required. Plug it in and let it go. The setting up of the app for my iPhone was more of a challenge as despite following the directions to a 'T', it took multiple attempts (about 45 mins) to get it to connect with my phone. We named ours Ronnie :) and he has been doing a great job going from the hardwood floors in the kitchen and dining room to having no issues heading into the carpeted living room. I would say Ronnie gets about 90% of debris and dog hair throughout the first floor as he bounces around the house before returning himself to his home, charging up for his next bout. He occasionally gets stuck under our dining room table but calls out for help as well as a phone notification. Emptying the debris is simple and overall we are happy with this purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,Awesome robot butler,"This is our second Roomba. We got our first one 6-7 years ago and while it does still run, it's gotten less efficient in its old age and seems to get stuck more. So he's been relegated to back up. The new one is nice because of the app, so if I forget to start it, I can do so remotely. It still meanders, but it is more efficient and picks up more dirt than the old one. In general, Roombas don't clean as well as our Dyson vacuum, due to sometimes missing spots and having trouble with corners. However, it is fantastic for taking care of the daily dirt, especially if you have kids/pets and get sick of constant debris. It's also great with kids because you can tell them to tidy up so the Roomba doesn't get their stuff, and they like pushing the button to start it. If anyone in your family has long hair, I recommend getting the Roomba cleaning tools kit, as you'll need to deal with the hair wrapped around the brushes every few weeks. Pros: Remote start and finish via app Scheduling You don't have to do anything except press a button Cons: It's loud and less efficient than vacuuming by hand, so I find it's best to have it vacuum when we're out of the house It's loud; I tried scheduling it to run at night, but it kept waking us up bumping into our door. This model doesn't come with the virtual wall or the ability to map rooms, which are both really nice. I wish it did, but I also got this one from the used/like new section which made it half price, so I'm not going to complain. However, if I were going to pay more, I'd buy one of the versions that offers those options, so I could send it on missions to clean specific rooms.","Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2023"

We’ve had to replace his side brush twice and the main brushes finally got so matted we replaced them recently as well. Otherwise the battery still works for a full clean and he’s still doing his job. See original review below which still stands. ORIGINAL: Yes we named him Phillip (fill up). His pronouns are he/him. And thanks to him, my house always looks clean. He moves seamlessly between the kitchen, bathroom and carpeted living room. He can’t usually find home very easily, but I think it’s because I’ll just set him on the floor upstairs or downstairs to do a quick clean of the bedrooms, rec room, etc, so he never gets a good sense for the map of the room. CONS: this is a pretty dumb model. There is no discernible pattern to his vacuuming, but he runs every day so over the course of a few days hits everything. Updated models have sensors but this one just bumps into stuff and is pretty clumsy. It’s not very quiet (but are any vacuums?), so I have to turn it off for any calls. Check the video in this review with sound. The brushes get pretty tangled up with stuff, so I’ve had to clear them out a few times already to make sure he can pick everything up. This thing doesn’t reach far into corners very well. PROS: look at all that stuff he picked up in one go! My house holds two adults, three little kids, a big dog, and lots of everything bagels. This little guy keeps it much neater. I can set it on any floor, hit go, and walk away and return to cleaner floors. Can handle different surfaces. Doesn’t suck up my throw rug tassels. It links to Alexa and the app is also easy to use to schedule cleaning and get updates.

B0CNKX4429,4,Amazing as a supplemental tool; won’t replace your primary vacuum cleaner,"This product is awesome! Now we rarely ever have to sweep the vinyl and tile flooring in our apartment. As a tool for hard floors, this thing is fantastic. As a tool for carpet, I’d say it’s barely acceptable (it will do an okay job at cleaning your carpet - you’re better off with a traditional vacuum cleaner for carpets). CONS: 1. It’s not “smart” the way you think it would be. It just wanders around and redirects itself when it hits an obstacle. I know the same company does have models that will actually follow a mapped pattern, but this one doesn’t do that. 2. The app seems to only work as a remote start if you’re connected to a Wi-Fi network (any Wi-Fi network, not just your home one). It doesn’t seem to play nicely with mobile data for some reason. 3. This one also isn’t the “pet-owner” model, so make sure there is no pet waste (or training mats, small toys, etc) on the floor prior to running. 4. The charging base (“home”) for the unit is a bit slippery, so sometimes the base will be unreachable and the battery will die. We fixed this by adhering it to the vinyl flooring with carpet tape, so now it doesn’t push its own dock when docking. 5. It gets stuck on certain types of chairs, so we generally will put our chairs up on the table (as if we’re about to mop). 6. It takes quite a while to find its dock when you send it home - you’d think the software would be slightly more advanced. PROS: 1. This thing has 95% replaced our broom and dustpan. 2. This is FAR quieter than a normal vacuum cleaner. 3. It can be programmed to run automatically on a schedule. We used this feature for a while. If you do this, I suggest running it early in the morning before you wake up (especially if you live in a small place and/or you don’t own a pet).","Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2022"

But so far it's been able to make it back if you set a time limit, say 45 minutes, which is plenty of time for it to wander back to the dock. It doesn't make a bee line to the dock; it wanders a bit more which is probably why it dies. I would've thought that it would be able to plan ahead, but again, it's not that smart. - I have a super soft long shag rug. I tested to see if it can vacuum through it, and you can definitely hear it struggle. It finally got stuck and it ended up tearing out strands from the rug. So I have to fold over the rug before I run it, which is not that big of a deal to me. - It aggressively bumps into things so I'm wondering if over time it'll start wearing some surfaces. Overall I'm satisfied. It does the thing.","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2021"
B0CNKX4429,4,Good for homes with large areas,Works very well in open areas like living/dining room. 4 stars are due to it getting stuck in small areas and shutting down.

B0CNKX4429,4,Great product but requires some upkeep,I got my roomba to help with my dogs hair and the constant vacuuming I have to do. The set up was easy and using/scheduling the roomba is easy. The only down sides would be you have to take apart and clean the brush often and also keep up with replacing recommended parts. Occasionally my app glitches and can’t connect to my roomba but it is a fairly easy process to reset it. For me it does not replace deep cleaning but it more so a good supplemental tool between deep cleaning.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,Amazing Upgrade love it mostly but...the brushes are easily broke - year later sigh,"I really like this roomba but don't expect miracles. you still have to clean up your floor so it doesn't get tangled with cords, socks, strings, craft materials and anything that is cloth. My only issue is the brushes! I fell in love with robot vacuums but I just wish the brushes were made slightly more high quality. I do not have a problem otherwise. It runs great and sucks great. It collects significantly more junk than my previous coredy one which was just a giant hole no brushes. I do believe the name brand does make a difference. But - be prepared to get replacement Parts before Less than a year both my spinning brush, foam brush and bristle brush are absolutely destroyed. I understand maintenance but I hope in the future they are of slightly more higher quality than this. The rest of the vacuum is amazing! I love the scheduling app - I set mine up automatically M-F give it vacations on the weekend lol.

B0CNKX4429,4,Convenient for Pet Hair and Under Furniture and Beds.,"It’s super convenient for under the bed and tables. Also convenient to just turn it on and let it go. The very first time I let it loose, I was AMAZED by the suction!!! Now in my 6th use and i’m not impressed. I empty the tray every time and even clean and rotate the filters. I did take it apart today and cleaned the rotating brush really well. Hoping this makes a difference. I have 2 pets that shed and I know I myself have long hair that I shed. This is what I wanted it for. I also downloaded the app and synced with my phone. I specifically paused it while it was cleaning and “sent it home”, but it DID NOT GO HOME. Waited a full 5 minutes before just picking it up and bringing it home myself. *Update* Now 2 months in. It DOES do the bare minimum of surface cleaning and DOES go under the bed and under dressers and coffee tables which I sincerely appreciate. It’s the lowest end model and you are getting the minimum. That said, I’m still happy with the purchase in this budget. For an 800 sq ft place with pets, it’s doing a good enough job. I do have to clean fur and hair out of the rotators after each use to get the maximum clean. I have also noticed that it does not like to pick up small scraps of paper or feathers that come out of blankets and pillows. I think you get what you pay for with this low end model and I’m still happy I purchased it.","Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2022"

Does not pick up larger objects like leaves. This one was used in great condition. I probably have to unplug it once a month to reset it. I was very skeptical of these things so I bought the cheapest one to try it out. It sounds like a radio controlled car. It occasionally gets stuck under the cabinets.

Very happy with that, but in just 2 months the side-brush stopped working and it was not cleaning as well. After research on the ""University of Youtube"" we found this is a common failure. The replacement part was only 16 bucks, and only a few screws and a few minutes to fix. One of the notes we found said that replacing the motor every 3 months or so is not unusual.

I’ve ran it 4 times and notice a huge difference in the cleanliness of my floors. This model does NOT have the mapping feature, so it just kind of aimlessly bounces around the house. Does seem to struggle and get stuck in tight spaces, and takes it a while to find its way out. Also struggles to get back to the base when it’s done with a full 90 minute clean, especially if it’s in a different room from the base at the end of the cycle.

Probably the feature that we felt was missing was the ability to map the house and only clean certain rooms at different frequencies . The newer models can do that.

B0CNKX4429,4,Quantity over quality,"I've had it for about 2 months and set it up to run on a daily schedule. The suction isn't great, and it will go right over dust without getting it all. But, running daily, over time, it ends up doing a better job than me vacuuming rarely. Overall, I have far less dust on my floor than I had before the Roomba, which was my goal. I haven't yet, but I expect I'll still be manually vacuuming sometimes and picking up everything it missed, like very fine dust. It's absolutely stupid, and will get stuck in rooms, and drive right past the base station even near the end of the 90 minute run, and end up running out of battery. I don't see any evidence that it has any sort of learning to it. It's also a little aggressive with running into things and pushing them, like bathroom wastebaskets. I've had to remove some stuff from the floor, which I suppose is a good thing. There doesn't seem to be any way to control the length of the scheduled runs. It seems like it might be set to run for 60 minutes, plus the amount of time needed to find its way back to the base station. The battery lasts for 90 minutes (still lasts 90 after 2 months), and it runs down the battery without finding the base station about half the time. I have the base station centrally located in a hallway, it shouldn't take that long to find it. The Roomba doesn't seem to have any memory of its location.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2022"

B0CNKX4429,4,"Good for price/brand, could be better overall","For the price, it’s totally fine, but I almost wish I splurged for the more expensive models. The product is well-made for sure in that it’s sturdy and very decent suction power for such a small machine. This is best for touch ups to minimize dust and hair between regular vacuuming, but don’t expect it to replace regular vacuuming (and definitely not for deep clean). It gets stuck and “confused” more than I thought it would between thin chair legs and fairly flat rugs, then it requires you to physically move it to restart once it can’t find its way out or off of whatever has caused the error. It doesn’t have mapping like the more expensive models (and I don’t think it has any sort of memory), so if you want it to go down an area that isn’t open space, you might have to keep an eye on it or sweep out a test pile to make sure it actually reaches down the hall or through doorways or anywhere that isn’t super open, or under certain furniture etc. I do love how easy it is to clean. The tray does need to be cleaned out every 1-2 uses, even with minimal dust build up.

B0CNKX4429,4,Works well but wonders around from room to room,"Pros - The Roomba vacuums everyday which helps tremendously with keeping the floors free from dust, hair, small debris, etc. I love this as I can be doing other things while my floor is getting a general cleaning job. Cons - it seems to have no direction and cleans the same area over and over again. I’ve tried programming it to do one room at a time but it doesn’t seem to matter with the the Roomba. He just does his own thing. He eventually gets everything vacuumed it just isn’t very efficient with time management. 😉 He doesn’t go back to his charging dock when the battery is about to die. He keeps going until he kicks the bucket and that’s where you’ll find him. This isn’t too big of a deal but wanted to pre-warn you that my Roomba isn’t the brightest of the bunch. I can’t let him roam the house unattended b/c he always finds a charging cord (that my kids leave everywhere) or gets stuck under a chair. If you would like to use your Roomba when not at home, make sure EVERYTHING is off the floor. My cords for the lamps are tucked tight to the wall but he seems to suck them up every time he’s near them. With these Cons, I would definitely buy it again. Only listed the Cons so you would know what you’re going to get. I have other friends that have the same model and they don’t have any of these issues.

B0CNKX4429,4,"Love it, but…","I spent a lot of money on the very first Roomba that came out. It needed a lot of help with things getting stuck inside, wound around etc and didn’t handle wires on the floor well. It needed repair the first year and died in the 3rd year. I bought another a couple years later, same issues, and died 2 years later. I tried a new better model and again, 2 years and the circle of pause and death. Same issues with having to remove hair from ends of brushes. I bought parts and coaxed it back to life for another year when it died. So I was reluctant to buy another. Recently we added a second golden retriever to the family and my dyson just wasn’t cutting it. We have a LOT of fur flying. Since this Roomba is for pet hair I decided to try it, and I also bought the extended warranty. So far with this one there are fewer issues, I am not constantly helping it over carpets and wires. The battery is MUCH better. Unfortunately the brushes are the same, so expect to spend time cleaning them and taking them out to get the hair off the ends. For some reason this one tells me when it needs recharging and dies where it is rather than going to the base. This may be operator error as I haven’t bothered to read the manual or upload the app. Being a teacher in the pandemic I need help and Roomba does cut down the daily vacuum routine. Just expect to do some maintenance and I recommend extended warranty.","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2022"
B0CNKX4429,4,Decent vacuum for the price,"This irobot is an upgrade for me from a cheaper off brand robot vacuum. I gotta say, at first I wasn't very impressed. It is the lower end irobot model, but for being THE name of home cleaning robots it had some problems. First problem, and perhaps the biggest, is that it's too rough with it's docking station. It moves the dock around when it leave to clean, so when it returns home it's dock is moved to an awkward position and can't return to charge, killing the robot. It happened many many times. I was actually getting ready to return it because it's a hassle. However I tried to fix it. I attached the docking station to the wall with some brackets, and it worked! It comes and goes home just as it's designed to do. I will say I have linoleum floors, so maybe the dock didn't grip that. If you have a different floor type it may stay better or worse Second problem is, it's too tall. It has a taller circular notch at the top (I believe to communicate with the dock) that sticks out about 1/4 inch above the rest of robot. This notch doesn't allow it to reach under a lot of my furniture. And third problem, it's really really loud. You basically have to run it when you're not home, or else you can't conversate, or watch TV, or anything. It's quite loud. So there you have it. It's certainly and ""okay"" vacuum. It does it's job but you gotta know the quirks if you're getting a lower end model. Maybe I'll leave a longevity review down the line.

I bought this model with the intentions of seeing if it would work for my family's lifestyle and boy did it exceed my expectations. For a little bot she does a fanominal job at cleaning up pet hair off the hard wood and carpeted floors. Now I wouldn't recommend this replacing a good personal vacuuming. But if your out alot like us these little buggers are great for in-between the deep cleaning days. Will deffinantly be upgrading our bot as I feel somthing with mapping and a built in garbage can on the dock would be better.

They have very different hair types, and are constantly tracking in dirt, dust and hair. I used to vacuum AND sweep at least once a week, but now I only have to do this every few weeks for a deep clean. My husband and I are impressed and grossed out about all the debris this thing can pick up. It makes a big difference in the high traffic areas of our home. Only cons - it's much louder than we thought. It sounds like a normal handheld vacuum (which I guess I should have expected lol). We chose the model where we have to empty the dust chamber thing manually, which we have to do almost every time it runs. But again, we have two dogs, so others may not need to empty it as much. It also gets lost and gets stuck A LOT. Sometime it will vacuum the same room over and over, then redock itself. Other times it will find its way to all parts of our house, but it's rare. Probably every other time we run it, we get a notification on our phones that it's stuck somewhere and has run out of battery (we have a one story home, but sometimes he'll get stuck on the edge of a rug).

This one does not have the mapping technology so it just goes around bumping into everything. It’ll vacuum the same spot 10 times and miss others.

Once I got it all charged up I quickly had it start a ""job"". It completely missed my office though! Huh, weird. Well maybe next time! Nope. Missed it again. No weird entry, door, anything blocking. Nothing. When it finally went into the office (probably 3rd time trying) the 3 prong rotating brush (not clear on part names) caught on the end of a rug. This stopped the job (which I understand) and led me to go help it out. Except it broke off!!! I have used the Roomba less than 5 times and something already broke! Really?!? Ugh. Granted the replacement part is like $10 but on principle I'm disappointed to already have to buy something for it. Be prepared to do the same. Other areas to note: it misses parts in each room. I can still see cat litter throughout the house both randomly and in chunks (where didnt go over spot at all). Disappointing since this was part of why I wanted to purchase! The cat hair and litter bits. Also it's WAY louder than thought it'd be. Won't be running while baby naps, I'm working from home or need to concentrate. I'd recommend running when you know you'll be out running errands. Overall I dont know if I just got my hopes up but it doesn't replace what a human can do by any means.

B0CNKX4429,4,Better than expected for the cheapest model,"Overview: This model has some drawbacks, but overall I’m happy. Pros: Definitely made a large impact on the upkeep for our house. It picks up most crumbs and other debris on our vinyl floor. The battery lasts for a full clean on our downstairs area. We have no problems with it transitioning from rugs/doormats back to the vinyl. Cons: This model just aimlessly cleans with no real pattern until it bumps into something. For long cat hair and lighter debris, it sometimes blows it away when near instead of picking it up. It has some trouble finding the dock when we send it back, it’s usually just easier to pick it up and put it back on in the charger dock. It only gets stuck on the joint of our fridge, but it’s not a huge deal. Honestly, if you have the money, I imagine some of the newer models have resolved the issues we experienced. For us, we don’t mind it’s flaws and buying it on sale was worth it.

It struggles to return home despite the fact that I live in a 750 sq ft apartment with few obstructions. It sometimes decides to randomly stop, not because the battery is dead. It just stops.

It did get stuck in one or two places repeatedly adding a small trim under one cabinet bounces off rather than wedges underneath..It does repeatedly get caught at one edge of a step that it seems not to be able to detect quickly enough. I have a small board behind the counter I set in front of the step on vacuum days so it no longer encounters the step. I am impressed that it collects a lot of dust and that the house does look better between deep cleanings. I rent out a room to Airbnb and just carry it there and set it going to clean the floors between boarders. I come back and the floor is clean.

B0CNKX4429,4,Power charging plug design flaw,"I am new to the Roomba technology. It has lived up to its reputation. The vacuuming has served me well, thank you. But may I suggest two design improvements. First, the plug-in for charging has repeatedly failed me. I left the unit on charge, but when it's time to clean again, I found the unit was out of charge. Upon examination, it's due to the plug to the charger having come unconnected on its own, due to the rigid cable and the fact that the plug cannot be securely locked down. (See photo.) It seems a simple design change that adds a press-down lock to the plug-in would eliminate this problem. Second, cleaning the bin and the filter is messier than I like: 1) The bin door is hard to operate for someone with weak fingers, and 2) I have to put on a dust mask and keep the bin & filter in a shopping bag to do the messy cleaning.

B0CNKX4429,4,Great vacuum for the price.,I did not realize when I ordered this roomba that it had no handle to lift for cleaning or repositioning. I purchased this to replace my previous roomba which did have a handle. Otherwise price was exceptional and it always finds dirt even after vacuuming with my Dyson. It's pretty inconvenient as we are senior citizens and not as strong as we used to be without the handle device.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,"Works wonderfully, some what loud","I know this is a lower end unit, but I am really happy with it on our hard floors. It's picks up a tremendous amount of dog hair. We have had this 2 months and have been very pleased. The app works very well also. It's a little noisy but not tok bad. Sometimes I think it's charging and it's not. It is hard to get it just right on the charger.","Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,Picks up a lot of can just move hair around,"Got this so it could pick up the litter the cats leave around, also for the hair. It does really good for the first one but it seems to push around a lot of animal hair and just blowing it from 1 place to the next as seen in the video. It was super easy to set up and even had an app but make sure you have good wifi to use the app. Mine is for a basement so my wifi down there isn't great, but you can still manually press clean for it to go. It.does bump into things hard but it learns quick and softly bumps into things after that. It goes over area rugs easily and borders into the next room. When needing a charge it will report back to its dock. Super easy to clean out debris too, just if it's overfill, which mine is from 1 go around with 1 dog and 2 cats...it will spill out when cleaning it out so be careful. I would purchase again but possibly the self cleaning roomba that empties on its own into a canister. They may be loud but I think with all my pets, would be worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2022"
B0CNKX4429,4,Excellent for apartments with carpet and pet hair!,Overall I’m very pleased with my purchase. It is a big pain in the ass to get the Wi-Fi hooked up. In order for it to pair it has to be on a 2.4 ghz connection. And if you have 5Ghz You’ll need to manually shut off the 5G on your router. A couple YouTube videos helped me out on how to pair device to my Wi-Fi network. I actually have to do the same process with any smart appliance I have in my home as well so I was aware on how to do it. As far as the product itself. I do love it. Where do I think there could be improvements? I wish that this specific package came with a way to design a layout on the app. But naturally that just leads me to Buying the more expensive models. Like I said overall very pleased. It’s a great thing to have when you’re in the office all day and you can set it up on a reoccurring schedule at 11 AM while your away. Coming home to lines on the carpet is a great feeling,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2022"
B0CNKX4429,3,"No mapping. Not great, iRobot!","The vac works well, hard floors, short pile rugs, BUT it has no mapping feature. You can't set it to clean a particular room or rooms. I got it on sale; if I paid the $200+ full price I would have definitely returned it. No mapping = aimless random directions with no control over where it goes. All you can control is how long for it to run. I suppose it would work for a small apartment, not a house with multiple rooms.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,3,"Decent Vacuum, but stopped automatically returning to base.","This is the second robot vacuum we've owned. Our first was a Eufy, which we liked, but had to get rid of when we moved. The Roomba does a decent job cleaning, especially if you take the time to clean out the brushes and filter on a regular basis. It will get stuck on things at times - we've had to 'robot' proof the house a little bit as we've figured out where it gets caught. We NEVER use the app and don't have it set on a timed schedule, we just push the clean button and let it do it's work. The EUFY had a remote control, which I really liked. The Roomba has a higher profile than our EUFY did, so it doesn't get under the TV cabinet or other things like we were used to. The filters on the Roomba have plastic around them, where our EUFY had a paper/fabric filter along with a 'spongy' one, but no plastic. The Roomba only has 1 rotating sweeper on the front, where the EUFY had 2. The only real problem we've had with the Roomba is - it stopped recognizing it's base about a year ago. We've cleaned the contacts and tried resetting it, but it won't return, so we pick it up wherever it stops and manually return it to it's base to charge.","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,3,Not too smart for a robot..,"1) iRobot probably cut corners on an RTC chip to save money, stupidity relies on your phone/tablet to keep time - which drifts if not active at all times. 2) Roomba is extremely network invasive and doesn't want to be on your guest network..so I put it on my main and do device isolation. 3) for something that runs every single day, for years on end, it should retain coordinates and a map in it's ""brain"" instead of getting stuck in the same spots over and over. Duh! 4) this unit spins out the sweeper brush all the time, I had to add a small drop off loctite to keep it on. When this dies, I'm trying another brand.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,3,It’s Cheap For A Reason,"In the world of robot vacuums, the name “Roomba” is ubiquitous. People associate it with quality and life-changing convenience. But that standard isn’t exactly upheld with the 694 model. Glitchy software, poor movement performance, and excessive noise make this entry-level machine fall short. That said, if you’ve never had a robot vacuum before, or if you’re looking for a budget unit this could be a decent pick. It has app control, Wi-Fi, automated scheduling, cliff sensors, Alexa and Google Home integration, and even location awareness. These are all excellent features to have in this price range. Additionally, this vac does a fantastic job at its main purpose—vacuuming. After it’s finished with a cleaning cycle, when I empty the bin, it’s always full of dust and debris. A lot of dust and debris. Where things get dicey is with the other aspects of its performance. Take the noise level, for example. When this machine is on, it’s at or around the same noise level as a handheld vac. It’s not excessive, but it is loud enough to be heard from anywhere in my home. Then there’s the alerts. When it needs attention or when it starts a cycle, the bot chimes fairly loudly. Of course, this level might be subjective, but for me the alert volume is louder than many other vacs I’ve tried. There’s also no way to lower or silence these alerts, which is frustrating. In addition, the machine loses connection with the app quite frequently. If I need to stop the vacuum, and I try to do so with the app, it’s 50/50 on whether it will actually stop. When it doesn’t, I have to manually press the button on the top of the vac to get it to shut down. Finally, the sensor on the top of the machine causes it to get stuck in places you might not expect. We have a television stand in our master bedroom with iron legs and crossbars, and this machine ALWAYS gets stuck on the crossbars. It’ll get halfway under, the sensor won’t stop it, and boom, I get an alert that it needs help. It also gets stuck under our dressers, which it mistakenly reports as cliffs. Strange, I know. That, to me is the biggest problem. I purchased a robot vac to cut down on the time I spend vacuuming. However, being forced to monitor the machine as it cleans so doesn’t get stuck is not my idea of convenient. I’m certain several of these issues could be solved via tweaking the firmware of the machine. But, as this is a budget model, the idea that any of this stuff might be corrected through updates is probably a pipe dream. I’m sure Roomba would rather you buy the next step up in their line rather than devote time and energy to updating this product. Overall, there is a reason this vacuum is constantly on special. It’s most likely a loss leader, with the idea being that you’ll buy it, be unhappy with it, and return it for the next step up. On the other hand, if you’ve never had a robot vacuum before, this is not a bad machine to start with. Just don’t expect it to change your life.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023"
B0CNKX4429,3,Mostly works,The little sucker wanders aimlessly around the house picking up most of what it should. It takes 100 minutes to vacuum what would take me 20 minutes with a standard vacuum. It likes to get stuck under the table so I pick up the chairs when it’s about to start and then run around picking up random toys scattered about. It also gets stuck in corners sometimes. I don’t know why it doesn’t just back up six inches and then turn. Seems like a simple program adjustment to make. Certainly seems like a better solution than the jitterbug it attempts to do now.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,3,Not ideal for levels with many rooms.,"Our home was built pre-open floor design in1930 and the first floor is divided up into 6 different rooms. Unit has a hard time finding its was into them all and actually cleaning them. The three bigger rooms close to where the unit is parked it does pretty good in, I'd say it gets 95% of the floor space cleaned in those rooms. Our 2 yr old daughters bedroom and our master bedroom are on the first floor as well and the unit barely makes it into those, and when it does it seems to get turned around and heads right back out of the door and doesnt find its way back in again. I have ""steered"" it into those rooms before by tapping the sensors and kept turning it until it goes into them, but the problem with that is our daughter is terrified of it so we generally only run it when nobody is home during the day so thats rarely an option for us. It's not overly loud by any means I don't think she just isn't a fan of any noise that isn't a Shrek movie! It's def not as loud as the corded Shark or the cordless Dyson we have and she is terrified of those as well. We also haveb2 boys and a 95 lb dog living here. So the main reason for buying it was so my gf didnt have to a vacuum 3 times a week and scare our daughter with them... A house with larger open rooms I'm sure it would work better for. The rooms it does stay in it does clean pretty good in. And the wifi feature is really nice to start it when we aren't home. The other complaint I have is because of the amount of rooms and limited ways in and out of them the unit only finds its way back to the charger like maybe half the time before it dies. The other half we find it dead in a room someplace and have to carry it back to the docking station. Kind of minor but kind of annoying. It does run continuously for almost exactly an hour and a half before it runs out of juice so they are right on with that claim. Overall for the money it does clean really well and in general I'm happy with the purchase because it does do a pretty good job in the rooms where most of the foot and paw traffic is. If you have a house with a lot of rooms like ours though you might want to look into one that has mapping capabilities so it's sure to clean each room and finds its way home when it needs to charge. If I had a house with only a couple large areas it needed to clean I would def have given this unit 4 stars, maybe even 5.","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2023"
B0CNKX4429,3,"I knew it wasn't a ""smart"" Roomba, but it's a lot stupider than I though it'd be","It doesn't use cameras or sensors to guide it through my apartment, which is fine--I don't mind not having my entire apartment mapped out and sent to some server. However, it's just frustrating to run. It constantly gets stuck under my couch, in part because it will bump into the couch, and instead of turning the opposite way, it'll just do a whole 360 and bump into the couch AGAIN. Rather than make small adjustments when it bumps into furniture, it almost always does a 360 and bumps into the same thing, and this happens over and over until I have to pick it up and set it somewhere else. Because of this, it almost never picks up fur underneath cabinets in my kitchen. Yet when it goes over any of my rugs (which are thin, non-carpet rugs) it SUDDENLY remembers how to make a 180 turn and go somewhere else, leaving the fur on my rugs. I have a double-coated Great Pyrenees and it's summer so he sheds A LOT. To keep up with it, I'd have to vacuum basically every other day. So I thought this would make my life a bit easier, but it's just so frustraingly stupid that it's more of a nuisance than anything. I have to cut my dog's fur out of the rollers; a problem I don't have with my vacuum. I will say that it's very simple to empty. That's pretty much the only compliment I can give. I hate leaving negative reviews but I just don't think this Roomba is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,3,Bare bones but not bad,"As far as quality goes, it seems well made, but this is pretty basic for the features and is probably over-priced in today's market. Mainly paying for the IRobot name. Not that there is anything wrong with that. It does the job it's supposed to. The good: It really helps to keep excess dirt off the floor. I was really surprised by how effective it is in keeping excess dirt off the floor and the biggest help for me, is the dog hair it picks up. I have a German Shedder and this vacuum does a great job of keeping the hair under control. Even when I would say the floor is clean, this thing always finds something. It somehow, even without mapping features seems to cover the whole floor. Emptying is simple and taking the rollers out to clean them is not rocket science either. Battery life has been great. It usally runs for an hour and a half each time it cleans. The bad: Not the smartest kid on the block. I usually have to pick it up at least once while it is cleaning. It can just barely fit under parts of my couch and will get stuck there sometimes. I could probably stop this by blocking those parts of the couch where it gets stuck, but I think it should be able to navigate them better. It is a bit noisy. Most of the noise comes as it bumps into things while going on its merry way. I really think that at this price it should have mapping features. It seems to cover everything, but in the most random way you can imagine. Maybe it's just me, but I find it annoying and would much rather it have a more logical pattern. Overall, I would say it does a good job, but could be a lot more refined in how it does it.","Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,3,Not worth the price,"Roombas are game changers, but this specific model is not worth the price it's selling for on Amazon. I've had a Eufy that i bought for $80 or so 3 years ago (it was all my budget allowed at the time), that is so much better than this Roomba. And yes, I get that this model is a bit older, so I can't speak on the newer more expensive models. If you can afford the latest Roomba, by all means get one!!! At their price points, I'm sure they will perfectly fold all of your laundry and play soft music while they clean up your life (or at least, I hope they do). I still can't afford one, so I'm sticking to the basic floor sweepers. Jokes aside, my review is for this Roomba specifically, which I bought because it's the most popular selling model on Amazon. Here's my own personal feedback as compared to my cheaper/older Eufy, and I hope it helps anyone on a budget who may be wondering if it's worth the investment. Lack if remote: You have to download the iRobot app in order to control this Roomba. I'm all for apps when they work, but for a cleaning device I want everyone in the home (and guests) to be able to use it. They can't do that with this Roomba unless they're connected to the app. The Eufy comes with an actual remote control, so no app, wifi, or phone needed AT ALL. Functions: The Eufy can be easily directed to where it needs to go and, although limited, it can also be assigned specific tasks to do. You can opt to clean room edges only, spot clean a specific area, or let it go on auto mode to clean everything. You can set a daily cleaning time and also set for 30 minute sessions. The Roomba app can start/stop the device or schedule future sessions, but that's about it. You can't set this Roomba to do specific tasks. You can only schedule sessions in advance and set the time limits for them. The rest of the app focuses on analytics like cleaning history and whether or not it completed it's scheduled task. That's really so unneccessary, and seems to just be a way for the company to collect use data. Also, if you want to set room or area bounderies, you'd need to buy additional parts. Size, Noise, Suction, etc. The Roomba is bulkier so it won't fit in places the Eufy does. It's also a lot louder. The Eufy has adjustable power levels, and can be quieter when needed. The Roomba does have a higher suction power, but unless you're able to contain it in one room at a time, the battery drains well before it's done cleaning the whole house. Aside from that, Eufy has all the same other features that comes with this Roomba (dock charging, stairs sensing, self-charging etc). I bought a new home and wanted to upgrade and splurge a bit as a gift to myself, but after trying this one out a few times, it's going back. I ordered another Eufy instead. One day I'll just skip the robots altogether and get myself a butler instead, but until then...","Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2022"
B0CNKX4429,3,Does an average job; decent for the price point,"My cats are terrible at tracking litter everywhere regardless of what I’ve tried, so I got this to help with cleaning management. All-in-all, it’s done a fair job — with my busy schedule, I like being able to send the Roomba off to deal with the litter-covered bathroom. Generally, it does a good job at covering the whole room, but it often just kicks the litter around without actually removing it sort of defeating the purpose. It takes me 5-10 mins each day to do a better job, sometimes making me regret the amount I spent for this thing. However, when life gets truly hectic (as it sometimes does for me), I do appreciate having it; something is better than nothing when it comes to the amount of litter sticking to my feet. And it removes one thing from my to do list for the day. With these things in mind, I say look into spending more for better quality and other brands if that’s what’s important to you. Otherwise, it’s a fair fallback for when life gets crazy or motivation is low.","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2024"

You will have to take apart everything, down to circuits and wires, to remove the fur from all the spindles, gears, etc. Seven of Nine was having brush cage issues, the dreaded ""error 2"" before her warranty was up but wasn't throwing the error code. She was louder than normal even with daily dumping of the bin, replacing parts, and daily cleaning of brushes. Save your money, save your sanity, stick with a regular broom and dustpan. My regular vacuum lasts longer than this. It's just a luxury item to be honest, fun to have around but a PIA to maintain. I have both the iRobot and a knock-off for comparison for this review. Pros: Much easier to connect to the app, Bluetooth, WiFi, and Echo vs the knock-off brand. It took a total of 15 mins tops vs 2 hours with the knock-off brands. Works wonderfully on carpet! I have a medium height lush carpet and it really gets the dirt out. I ran the knock-off version five times before I got ""Seven of Nine"" and she still picked up more dirt than the knock-off brand. She has one side brush, knock-off has two, and she still performed better. She makes cute sounds that sound like Mario Kart before she starts, super cute. She maneuvers better under tables and around chairs vs the other brands. She may vacuum in the same spot multiple times before she makes her way to other areas, but I call it thorough. Cons: Seven does not map out rooms/the house. Unfortunately, the description made it seem like she did but she does not. (This can be easily remedied with modifying if you know how to work a soldering iron and around electronics, which we shall do to make her look even more like Seven of Nine) She has a drop sensor but does not know how to work herself backwards. There is a small stair area that leads downstairs before getting to a hallway and she throws an error, saying she needs moved to a different area of the house. The knock-off brand can maneuver itself backwards away from the stairs. Seven is only compatible with 2.4hz WiFi network which isn't make or break, but if you want your Echo or other home device to connect for voice commands you'll have to swap over everything to the other network. All in all I think the pros outweigh the cons if you can catch it on sale again, which made it cheaper than the knock-off brand. The knock-off brand also includes a mopping function.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2023"

B0CNKX4429,3,Great if you're looking for the most simple model out there - PLEASE READ,"My parents originally bought this for their home, however, they have black rugs and the vacuum will not go onto/over black rugs, carpet, flooring, etc. This model looks for shadows, and slows down or stops when it thinks that it is going to run into something or could get stuck, so it avoids shadows for this reason. They gave it to me after they could not use it. I do have to say, it does its job. It goes over my rugs (no black rugs), carpets, dark wood vinyl floor. It does a decent job of picking up dirt and debris. HOWEVER, it is VERY loud. I cannot be on the phone or be watching tv and have it running at the same time. There are no settings to change this, it only has 1 suction setting. As for the app, its basic. Almost anyone can use it. It doesn't offer what some other apps offer. It does not map out your home, you cant see what areas it cleaned within the app, it simply tells you how long it ran for and how many ""dirt events"" it counted. For this reason, there are some times that it has only cleaned half my home, docked it self saying job completed, when in reality it only did 1 large room for 15-20 minutes. I had to literally move it to the other rooms and start it for it to clean an additional room. It doesn't always do this, only occasionally. Overall, I wont say this is a bad unit. It does work and do its job. I think its great for people that are looking for something basic or for people that aren't tech savvy. If you want something that's a little more in depth on what its cleaning and to use it from the app, I would recommend upgrading to a different model or different brand altogether.

B0CNKX4429,3,The side brushes broke off after less than 5 uses,"We absolutely love our Roomba and wish we would've gotten one sooner! We enjoy the look and feel of our floors after the Roomba does its thing, even though our floors weren't particularly dirty before. The app and configuring the Roomba is tricky as it seems like you can't set a duration time for scheduled cleaning. My big disappointment with the Roomba is that the side brushes (the brushes that help get dirt at the edges of a room/furniture) broke off after less than 5 uses (flat floor, no objects besides furniture in the way, floors only had basic dust-I had done a thorough cleaning on hands and knees a couple days before first use). According to the app, these should last at least ~150 hours. It sucks that I have to spend more money to replace them already without knowing they'll even last longer than a few uses. For now, I have to sweep along the edges the old-fashioned way. I didn't expect such crappy quality from such an expensive brand-name item. Update (along with a decrease from 4 stars to 3 stars even though this product has the potential to be 5 stars were it not for the crappy quality of the side brush): I had gotten an Asurion Protection plan with this so tried to make a claim... this directed me to make a claim with Amazon... tried there and they directed me to the product company iRobot... after clicking around and reading it seems that brushes are not covered under the Limited Warranty even though they broke after a few uses. I do not have time to pursue this claim further or spend time waiting on the telephone to talk to people to get this resolved as I am short on time (hence why I got the Roomba in the first place).

B0CNKX4429,3,It's not good for pet hair,"There's an element about having this thing in your house that makes it feel like having a new pet. You imbue it with personality. It's a fun thing. We like it when it works. But sadly, that's only about 25% of the time. There's almost always a problem and it is terrible with pet hair. We have three well groomed border collies. The wheels and other moving parts are perpetually jammed up by anything it encounters. Dog hair among those things and Heaven forbid that some one drops a paper clip! I don't write a lot of reviews but this is an exception. If you read the product description, you should know that it's terrible with pet hair and that it is unreliable in ways that are unrelated to pet hair. What sent me to write this review is that it didn't launch on schedule, I pressed the button to get it moving. It came out from the dock, spun around in circles for 5 minutes and then died 2 feet from the dock. Like I said, it's fun when it works. I guess, It's also kind of amusing when it doesn't. :)","Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,3,NOISY,"Jumped for the Roomba when my Deebot (Ecovacs DEEBOT 500) gave up the ghost on the strength that iRobot is the leader in the field. Roomba is a more aggressive machine -- it moves faster and it trundles over objects like rugs (but also forgotten cords!) quickly and easily. However, with all that speed and power comes noise. This is NOT a quiet vacuum. Deebot was MUCH quieter -- I could actually think and work while it was merrily cleaning the room around me. Roomba is also thicker. It gets stuck (jammed) under the small ledge of the dishwasher and cannot go under about half of my furniture. Deebot easily glided under ALL my furniture -- under the china cabinet, under the cabinet overhang in the kitchen, around the corners of the recliners and sofa in the living room) I cannot let the Roomba run unsupervised -- it aggressively knocks into things and pushes stuff over -- broken recycled wine bottles anyone? -- whereas the Deebot bumped with way less force and then went elsewhere to clean. Roomba seems easier to maintain -- it seems easier to get into the part that collect things that stop the machine from operation. Deebot had a lot of hidden spots and difficult to get to corners. Both seem to need emptying about the same amount, but Deebot's dust collector was easier and less messy to tip into the trash. Downside to the Deebot was that it did not have the suck power that the Roomba has. Roomba takes care of pet hair easily and does a good job on the rugs. Deebot lasted almost 2 years doing very heavy duty work and then has stopped and requires someone with machine knowledge to get it started again and where to send it is mysterious -- unfortunately. Buy this model Roomba if you are patient, mostly deaf, want the good power, and don't mind the chaos it makes. Roomba, as a replacement for my elegant Deebot, is good but it is a bull in the china shop so supervise even after you have cleared up its path (as I am writing this review I have had to untangle it 3 times in the kitchen and stop it from pushing a bag of cans down the back steps! And if it crashes into my chair one more time ---#@!! Whoops -- there goes the cat feeder! Sigh.)","Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2021"

The cleaning itself was ok but it completely lacked on the maps feature. The app did not have an icon for maps too. May be I bought the wrong model. The very basic thing I was expecting was it will map my house correctly. It just cleaned the area of my living room (around the charging dock). I had to pick it up so as for it to map and clean the rest of the rooms. I was not able to create no go zones , invisible walls etc. Please check your requirements before you buy this robot.

One of the three small brushes of the rotating brushes is broken as seen in the pic. Called the iRobot company and they said it is not under warranty since the brush is considered an ACCESSORY. So apparently, the Limited Warranty is not only limited in time frame but also the type of parts that are covered? Why is the brush is considered an accessory when it is one of the crucial parts of the cleaning process? When I bought the Roomba, the brush has already included/attached as the standard part, no extra cost to buy it - so this is just a shady policy. Also, considering it is not even a year since I got it, the quality of the product is subpar.","Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,3,Not impressed,"This was a cute little vacuum, easy to download app & set up, & it went back to its dock without issue. It picked up hair and dirt on the ground but not as well as I expected. We have cats so we have fur on the ground. It picked that up but it didn't pick up all the dust it went over. I followed the robot w our dyson w the green laser that lights up all the stuff on the ground and noticed that the robot simply didn't pick up all of the dust. It would also not pick up all pieces of cat litter. This wasn't the deal breaker though as it picked up enough off the ground to be a little bit of a help. The biggest annoyance was that this thing horribly loud but it's not quiet at all and it just goes around and bumps into things, it doesn't follow any sort of pattern to ensure the entire room is vacuumed. I locked it in a small bedroom for almost an hour and there were still areas that hadn't been vacuumed. I'd definitely buy a quieter vacuum that follows a pattern in the future to reduce the trauma to our cats.","Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,3,Very dumb,Now I realize because The company has 10 different levels of what Roomba to buy this was very stupid. Some days they can go over the highest carpet and places you never think it would go then other days it gets stuck at the tip of the same carpet which makes no sense because the wheels are still on the hardwood floor. The wasted battery from its circling constantly in random order doesn't make any sense to me. Why they didn't map out even the most basic of their roombas was shocking. They just want you to buy the highest possible level they have and because they have so many different levels its distracting. If you have hardwood floors with nothing in the way it works fine now with that being said it will circle some of the same areas multiple times I'm not even get to one part of that same area because it has no mapping. For some reason it seems to go to the same area of my house every time It makes no sense and of course it's an area that has a very small strip for it to travel down and the rest of the house is open so how does it make it down that strip and then get stuck everyday? I would not purchase this version I'm not saying better versions or later versions are better but definitely go with one that has mapping to it. It will cover a lot more ground with battery power instead of going over the same areas non-stop before finding its way to where it needs to go.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2023"

B0CNKX4429,3,A Mixed Bag of Convenience and Hassle,"Having used an iRobot model about a decade ago, I was curious to see the advancements. Surprisingly, it felt pretty similar, with the main difference being that the new 694 seems more like a bulldozer to me. Cons: Aggressive Navigation: In my opinion, the 694 has a tendency to treat your walls, boxes, and furniture legs as obstacles in a demolition derby. It doesn't shy away from making violent contact, which can be concerning. Misses Spots: In my experience, it often leaves significant portions of the room untouched Sweeping Attachment Maintenance: The cleaning process for the sweeping attachment is a bit of a chore. I have a pair of scissors on hand to properly clean it, adding an extra step to what's supposed to be a convenience device. Requires Supervision: It's not quite the 'set and forget' gadget you might expect. Pros: Still Easier Than Manual Vacuuming: Despite its flaws, the iRobot 694 is still more convenient than vacuuming the space yourself. Suitable for the Semi-Lazy: If you don't mind keeping an occasional eye on it and are somewhat too lazy to do the vacuuming yourself, it does an adequate job.","Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,3,"My Experience: Save Money, Buy a Eufy","After about 3 years of daily use, our otherwise-reliable Eufy started sounding like a lawnmower and I couldn't get it to quiet down, so I decided to upgrade to a Roomba. However, after a month or so of use, I'm learning the Rooma isn't necessarily an upgrade: 1) This Roomba rarely finds the dock, almost always running out of power before locating it. Our Eufy almost never had this problem, despite using the exact same docking location for both. 2) I've watching this vacuum run straight over a crumb without picking it up. We run our vacuum overnight each night, and with the Eufy, things always seemed pretty clean (we have three young kids, so lots of crumbs!). The Roomba has done a far less quality job. 3) Probably related to #2 the Eufy had dual spinning brushes which would knock crumbs into the cleaning path, giving it a wider area it would pick up on each pass. This Roomba only has a spinning brush on one side, meaning it cleans less area as it travels. For these cheaper models where it's not mapping your house, but rather randomly scooting around, the area it cleans on each pass is important. 4) The Eufy was a quieter machine, up until it started sounding like a lawnmower. 5) It talks a lot every time there's a problem. This wouldn't be a big issue during the day, but we run ours at night. The Eufy would beep for a short period if it got stuck, but the Roomba repeats the issue it's having every so often. For some, this might be a plus, but if you plan to run it at night, it can be annoying. So, for these cheaper units that get the job done without all the bells and whistles, I'll definitely be returning to a Eufy if/when this one needs to be replaced.","Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2022"

Good value if you can ignore the annoyances in the cons. Cons-I couldn't connect it to my wifi network. I tried the troubleshooting steps and hit a deadend with no solution. The app was pretty much useless as it couldn't find the robot to connect to it. The robot is pretty loud. I live in an apartment and leave early for work. I would love to run the vacuum when I leave, but I think it would be too much for my neighbors. The home button doesn't work-the robot reacts when you press it, but it drives around aimlessly rather than docking as it should.

B0CNKX4429,3,Almost as good as a lazy teenager with a vacuum cleaner.,"A Roomba is the equivalent of a lazy teenager with a vacuum cleaner. Rather than start in one area and carefully sweep side to side making sure to clean every square foot, the teenager and the Roomba randomly zig zag around the room maybe cleaning 70% of the floor and call it done. That's a Roomba - the lazy zig-zagging teen. We own a 2000 square foot home with carpeted bedrooms and hard surfaces in the living areas with area rugs. We have 2 dogs and so there are dust bunnies and pet hair scattered around. We bought the Roomba mainly so that when we leave, it would clean the hard surfaces and collect all the pet hair. It does not. It will zigzag around randomly for 45 minutes. When the cycle is done, the Roomba is full of pet hair and dust. Where it goes, it does clean very well. However, it does not clean everywhere. Imagine you have a large square room that is empty. Imagine an even coat of dust on the entire floor. After a Roomba cycle, imagine a bunch of zigzag lines where it cleaned some of the dust and left some behind. Bottom line, we paid $300 for a machine that will run randomly about the house, often get stuck on or under something and stop. When it does complete a cycle, it will be full of dirt, but we still need to use the vacuum to clean all the pet hair that was left behind. If you have lots of hard surfaces and want to come home to a floor completely clean, you'll either need to hire a maid or vacuum yourself. As I mentioned in the header, where it goes it cleans, but it goes randomly about and leaves lots behind where it doesn't go. Not sure we'd buy one again.","Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2021"
B0CNKX4429,3,brute force cleaning at the expense of your sanity,"This robot cleans well. If left to run, it will run and when it is done your space will be clean. However, this robots random wayfinding (navigation is far too generous a word for what this thing does) will waste a tremendous amount of time and drive you crazy if you're around for the spectacle. It just goes in random directions until it bumps into something, then it turns a random amount and does it again. Inevitably it knocks over the bicycle, tries to eat the cat, and dings furniture to no end. It will wander in circles. It will spend 25 minutes under a couch. It will go to the same exact spot and get stuck on a lip, or a dark rug (aka cliff), or its own power cord. It may find its base, or it may miss it entirely, or arrive to it eventually only to just push the base around for a while before giving up. It is not at all systematic, and will skip entire rooms so it can really focus on being underneath that favorite couch. It has no idea what it has done, nor what it needs to do with regards to the task of cleaning your home. If run enough, it will make your home clean. But it doesn't navigate as well as an ant, or a bee, or even an amoeba. It navigates like a handicapped pinball. I'll spend $100 more for a Roborock Q5 to get a far better app, more systematic cleaning and better logic, and less pinball-induced rage.","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2023"

B0CNKX4429,3,Mostly useless in our house,"I spent a lot of time researching various options before buying this model. So I really wanted to like it. But after six months, it sees almost no use. The unit is sturdily built but not too ""bright."" Our house has several dining room sets. The Roomba has no problem working its way through chair legs to get under the table but then spends 10 minutes trying to get out from under the table. Usually, I just go and rescue the thing. This unit doesn't learn anything--nor does the manufacturer so claim. It seems to be programmed to follow along the right side of objects but when blocked, it just heads across the room in a new random path until it hits another obstacle. In practice it covers the same parts of room over and over while leaving most of the room untouched. It is useless for trying to clean multiple rooms of a house. I think this unit would work best in a lightly furnished home/apt of just one or two rooms wth few, if any, floor level barriers. It gobbles up lamp cords and the like so be prepared to bail it out. I'm satisfied with its ability to hold the debris it picks up and it is fun to watch it work its way back to its dock upon finishing a job. (Finishing a job does not equal actually cleaning your floor.) Again, this unit would work reasonably well in a small, uncluttered space. We just seem to have too many obstacles for it to work about. It was not a good choice for us.","Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2022"

Even though fully charged, it returned to the dock on its own because it had a low battery after 34 minutes and the app said “job cancelled”. Another day I used it only in one bedroom, closing it off from the rest of the house. I never saw a “map”. Therefore, if I use Alexa to say clean the bedroom, it doesn’t, it leaves the dock and randomly cleans the living room. Battery doesn’t last that long.

It probably would benefit from starting from a clean slate; or just be prepared to empty it mid cycle and run it multiple times in succession (after recharging) when you first get it. Also you have to remember to empty it before the next run as it will get pretty full in one use with a high pet hair household. It's navigation leaves something to be desired. It's managed to get stuck a number of times; still trying to ""roomba"" proof areas that will trip it up (the edge of the fridge seems to be particularly problematic for it). The battery tends to last for about an hour and a half. My biggest complaint is probably it's ability to find it's dock. So far, about 30% of the time it ends up not being able to get back to it's dock and dies somewhere in the house. I've started closing the bathroom and master bedroom doors as those are problem areas; it seems to get ""trapped"" in the master bedroom and has a lot of difficulty finding its way back out, if it goes in there it will most likely run out of battery before it finds its way back out. The bathroom is another problem as it gets stuck on the small bathmat around the toilet where it ""sucks up"" the edge of it, making it fold over and then gets promptly stuck on it. It gets the high traffic areas pretty well, but it of course misses some areas.

I ended up getting a smart vacuum that avoided these traps, which was a game changer. I have this vacuum to my mom to run in her upstairs (where it got stuck under her chair and bed already 😑). This vacuum exceeds my expectations! I have thought about getting a robot vacuum for a while. I didn't want to spend a fortune but I didn't want a cheap junky one. This one seemed a good compromise. I run it every other day on a schedule and it does an excellent job. I never have to vacuum my floors with a regular vacuum. This is a vacuum that randomly goes across your floor instead of back and forth. But, if you run it regularly it does a great job.

It's dust bin does regularly need emptying, indicating it's doing it's job to some degree. Cons: 1. cleans under the couch regularly, but seems to actively avoid the kitchen where it is needed the most. (it's dock is in the kitchen.) 2. Gets stuck about half of the time it runs. 3. In the event of it actually finding its way back to its dock, it will often fail to park properly on it. A bit of sticky tack to hold the dock down to the floor helped quite a bit. also cleaning the charging electrical contacts every so often helps. 4. Watching this thing clean is super frustrating.

The quality does not match the price and the brand name is way overhyped.","Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,3,"Keeps getting ""stuck""",Easy set up; but it does a poor job sensing objects -- seems to go back and forth in same area; is constantly getting trapped in a corner or under a table. You will have to manually lift it up and carry it to different location,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,3,It's Okay,"Update: Absolutely horrendous customer service!!! After weeks of emails I finally got the answer to my question: the side brush is a “consumable” and is not covered by warranty; even in such a short period of time. Could have just said that without weeks of back forth and me providing photos, proof of purchase etc. They offered me 15% off an order of a bunch of stuff I don’t need. I just need the side brush as the unit is new, and they don’t even sell that separately… ———- It's ""smarter"" than my Shark, but it is very difficult and time consuming to clean the cat hair out the brush and roller. It gets caught in more stringy stuff (than Shark) and in a few short weeks the edge brush has a broken prong. It often dies before finding its dock. Although it does pick up a lot of cat hair, overall, for price and performance, the ""dumb"" Shark has been better.","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2023"
B0CNKX4429,3,This Thing is a Bulldozer!,"The Good: Sucks up the pet hair and crumbs fairly well. Good battery. Will often clean for 1.5 hrs across carpet and hardwoods. The Bad: LOUD af - like a leaf blower at 7 am on a Saturday morning loud. This thing is like a tank. It doesn't just lightly bump into walls, it truely tries to go through them - again and again and again. Sounds like someone is breaking into my house! Also, if there is a remote spot it can get stuck, this vacuum will find it. Also, app is constantly reminding that a bunch of items need to be replaced . . . even after the first month. My experience has been with Eufy vacuums. However, the batteries seem to die within a year on those, so I thought I would give Roomba a try. Roomba is especially brutal, loud, and not very smart.","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,3,Needs to be maintained after every use,"Bottom line is I hate vacuuming and very much like this Roomba. It's great at getting the dog hair, my hair, and dust that seems to accumulate all too quickly in my 600sqft faux wood floor apartment. I have a high quality full size vac but I just hate the work of lugging it around, even in a small space. Pros: -Cleans throughly in ~1 hour. The pattern is random but it doesn't miss much -Can reach under the couch and bed where my full size vac can't -App makes it great to use when you're not even home Cons: -MUST be maintained after every use if you want it to last! I use scissors to cut the hair that gets wrapped around the side of the brush, pull lint from the brush, and pop out the smallest wheel and use compressed air to clean there because so much HAIR just gets stuck in it while it works. There's no way this thing could do a decent job for very long if you don't clean it every/ every other use Neutral: -Must empty after each use -Noise is not great, not terrible, and I'm fairly sensitive to sound -Ocassionally drags a bath or kitchen mat with it a little but has never gotten stuck on one Overall I think it's great for limited hard floor areas, but you have to put in the work to maintain it!","Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2022"
B0CNKX4429,3,You get what you pay for,"I bought this Roomba on sale so I feel that for the price I got a good deal. Not worth if it’s full price. I realized after I purchased it that it doesn’t have room mapping technology but, like I said, you get what you pay for. It finds its way home usually fairly easily and generally doesn’t get stuck so already I’m doing better than I was with my knock off Roomba. My one complaint is that it will go around in circles in the same area it already cleaned and then go home leaving certain areas dirty. I specifically bought this to clean up the litter that my cats scatter when jumping out of the litter box. The Roomba will often “finish” its job and go back home with all the litter still scattered in the corner.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024"

I followed the steps but when it says to go to your phone wifi settings and connect to iRobot or Roomba, neither option is there. So that's annoying. It's not doing a great job picking up dust/pet hair and it definitely has no rhyme or reason to the path it chooses to clean. It will go over the same spot again and again and it will miss other areas. And it is noisy but I can live with that. I'll continue to use it for the next week or two before deciding if it's going to be returned. Maybe I just need to get used to it.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2023"

So instead they sent me an Amazon giftcard to purchase another one which sounds great, but because they all went up in price and I would have to buy the warranty all over again (even though it says 3 years), it would cost over $60 to buy the replacement one that is supposed to be free with the warranty.

I only purchased this for my master bedroom that has carpet much to my chagrin. I definitely can see the difference with the ability to suck up debris and clean deeper with my older unit. I believe this model that I have now is good for just floors but not as efficient and thorough for carpet. I would encourage people that have carpet in their homes to purchase a much more up-to-date model. Other than that, this is a good introductory unit for just floors of various types. It does have a nice long lasting battery and tends perform as other models in this class design. The app is troublesome. But it will run fine manually.

B0CNKX4429,3,Convenient but Not Without Quirks,"The Roomba 694 has undeniably made daily cleaning a breeze, yet it comes with a few quirks that deserve consideration. While its hands-free operation bring undeniable convenience, some aspects, such as occasional missed spots, the need for pre-set room arrangements, and noise level, may affect the overall user experience. The Roomba 694 occasionally falls short when it comes to thoroughness. Despite making multiple passes, there are instances where it misses a few spots, requiring manual intervention for a more comprehensive clean. This can be a minor inconvenience for those seeking a truly hands-free experience. To optimize the Roomba's performance, pre-setting rooms becomes a necessity. The robot's tendency to knock down objects raises concerns about potential disruptions and damage. Compared to other vacuums, the Roomba 694 is noticeably louder during operation. The audible hum may be a consideration for those who value a quieter cleaning experience, especially in environments where noise levels are a concern.","Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2023"
B0CNKX4429,3,Makes a lot of noise and does a very little job,"Unfortunately, this Roomba didn't work out for me. First, it is very noisy. You would think because of high suction power, but it's just average. You are supposed to connect it with an app and you can practically operate it using the app. So secondly, it doesn't map the area, therefore leaving out a lot of spots. As a result, it covers one area multiple times and doesn't touch the other areas at all. I returned mine as I believe there are other better choices for a lesser price. They are moderately easy to clean. I would have preferred that the entire trash socket come out.

B0CNKX4429,3,It’s ok. Same technology as a decade ago with not much improvement,"I used to have a Roomba about 10 years ago and it wasn’t very smart. It would get stuck in places and run into furnitures here and there. Sometimes it would run out of battery before it finds its way back to the base. This Roomba is basically no different. This Roomba has yet to finish a whole cleaning session without being stuck somewhere or needing help from me. The only difference between this Roomba and the Roomba I had 10 years ago is it doesn’t fall off stairs and you now can install an app on your mobile phone so when it gets stuck, it’ll notify you. If you are too busy to vacuum and you need something that would randomly vacuum and keep up a clean appearance for you house, then you should get it.

The iROOMBA runs zig-zags in a weird pattern all over and has now spent 1/2 hour back in the already done bedroom and hallway alone, while venturing out in the rest of the house, making zig-zags and returning to vacuum the bedroom yet again. It does pick up dust and hairs very well, but I don't like the cleaning pattern. I was not thinking that it was charging since the charge light on the charger never stayed on more than 3 minutes and the battery icon did not turn solid green. However, right before I was going to return it I tried it one more time and it apprears that a green battery OUTLINE does indicate charged. The manual that comes with it is useless and I cannot connect to my iPhone via wi-fi even though it does explain how that is supposed to be done. It just keeps showing ""connecting"" forever.

Being able to start the device remotely via the app is very convenient, but this model is slightly reckless as I found furniture rearranged, rugs folded, and Roomba 694 rarely made it back to the charging station.

It gets stuck at the edge of any step down and screams for help, where the old cheap robots would just turn around and rumble away. It's also incredibly clumsy - bumps into things HARD, sometimes knocking them over. Again, the old guys never had this problem. And it's so freaking loud!

B0CNKX4429,3,Not good if you have long hair. Otherwise it’s great.,"I had an i4 model that I adore and was alternating days upstairs and downstairs, but I’m just not that good at remembering to move the Roomba. Since the upstairs sees much less of the dirt traffic, I thought a “lesser” and cheaper model would work out fine. Had the brushes been the same, it probably would have. Unfortunately, this model has a typical vacuum brush with all the bristles. This means I get to spend ridiculous amounts of time cutting hair off the brushes. It is not the dogs hair. She fortunately has short hair that the Roomba brilliantly sucks up and disposes of as expected. There are 2-3 women (depending on college and such) with long hair living in my house at any given time. This does not bode well for bristles. The newer, more expensive, models do not have bristles. I should have sent this model back as soon as I saw them. To make a long story short, if you don’t have anyone in your home with long hair, this Roomba should work fine.

However our home is in a rural area and the wind blows dust into the house. Small dust size particles are what fills the collection container in my upright vacuums; this device didn't pick up any of that. We looked to see if there was something wrong with the vacuum portion; there is only a small fan (less than 2"" diameter) that could possibly generate any suction. After Roomba had 2 hours in the living room, I vacuumed with an upright and got the fine dirt picked up.

I charged it, did the set up, and then watched it work. It seems to have good suction, went from hardwood to rug easily, and had little sweepers that got right to the edges of the walls. But..... its path is random and it went over the same areas repeatedly while missing entire sections of the room. And, it skipped my bedroom entirely! Why just mine?

B0CNKX4429,2,Good purchase; had really high expectations. Great if you have a hard time with daily tasks.,"UPDATE 2023: This roomba has failed my expectations. In 1 year it has significantly declined in quality and function. It has trouble charging and the spinning arm no longer works. The machine has been maintained and cleaned regularly and still performs poorly. This roomba (idk about other models) absolutely SLAMS into doors, walls, baseboards, items, etc. It is very loud and has gotten louder. Off brand robot vacuums are more gentle and sense boundaries better. For $300 I expected a better machine that lasted longer. I’m to the point that I may trash it and buy another brand. Would I buy this machine again? No, I would buy a different brand/type Would I ever upgrade? Probably not with Roomba brand. Maybe shark or something different. Not sure. Would I recommend it to a friend? Not this model, no. ————————— I am someone who can become overstimulated to the point of not functioning, and then let mess get even worse. I wanted to automate even just one process of cleaning my apartment in hopes that it will help me prevent my house falling into a depression mess. I have the Roomba 694 (I think) and have never owned another kind or brand so I don't know how it compares to other models. I've had the Roomba since January 26th, 2022. If my feelings change, I'll try to update my review. If you don't want to read a novel, skip to the bottom! Pros: - Comes with an extra filter - Easy to set up - Automated vacuuming that you can leave to its own devices. Really convenient. - 1.5 hour battery life, which I rarely run out of - It can vacuum all the way under the bed!! - Automatically spot cleans dirty areas, or you can tell it to spot clean a dirty surface - Easy to disassemble to clean/empty - Goes over uneven surfaces well/has no problem with that - Generally does a pretty good job overall. - Cleans my hard wood, linoleum, and carpet alike. - It's pretty good at getting cat litter up, which is awesome, cause even my regular vacuum isn't great with that! - It ran over a cotton ball that was on the floor and dragged/smushed it into the carpet and left a white fuzzy streak. I thought ""Man, that's gonna take forever to get out of there."" When the robot made its way back over, it went over the cotton several times and cleaned it so well it was like it never happened. - Doesn't really get stuck too much - Makes a cute little song noise when it's done or docks at its home base lol. It's kinda cute (even though it's inanimate) Cons: - Small dust bin. It's a small vacuum, so that's a given, but you will have to empty it often. Luckily, that's easy and does not deter me from using it, but using a normal vacuum will collect probably like 5x the debris. If you don't want to empty it, maybe splurge for the self-emptying one. - Sometimes I have to ""babysit"" it. It will vacuum for half an hour only to miss the hall (which is not blocked off) or one part of the room. (I assume this is due to its random algorithm). It's kind of annoying to have to pick it up, set it down where I want it, and turn it back on for another cycle. - It's kind of loud. I know I know, it's a vacuum. But it's definitely not quiet enough for me to consider it peaceful, or even consider running it at night. If I choose to work while it's running, I have to put noise cancelling airpods in with my audio playing and even then I can still hear it. You definitely wanna be awake while this is running -- don't run it while someone is sleeping or napping. It's also a little loud when it bumps into walls or doors; definitely a tough little machine that's gonna bonk around. - When I send it home to the charge base, it will dock and I will check the app to make sure it connected properly and is charging. However sometimes, the next day or a few days later when I go to run a cycle, it tells me the battery is dead even though I have not moved it. I don't know if my cats are knocking it or jumping on it and moving it off the plates, but it's frustrating to have to wait for it to charge again when I tried to ensure that it was charging in the first place. - It's not great for deep cleaning. It's a round vacuum and it won't get into super tight cracks or corners. This is a good vacuum for every day, general cleaning but don't expect it to leave the place 100% spotless. OVERALL REVIEW: For a little less than $300, this robot is a good value. It helps make my life easier, both when I'm motivated or when I'm having a hard time. Honestly, the battery thing and the babysitting thing are what kept me from rating it 5 stars. All in all though, I recommend it! Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely. Would I ever upgrade to a more expensive model? Yes, I think so. Would I recommend it to a friend? Yes","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2022"
B0CNKX4429,2,Broke within a year,"I didn't have an issue with the fact that it's pretty quirky. As many reviews have stated, it vacuums very randomly, tends to get stuck alot, and after a very short time, seemed to have lost it's ability to find it's charging station. I cleaned it after each use, moved it from room to room as needed for cleaning & would reattach it to the charging station myself. I learned quickly where it would get stuck and how to avoid that. It was all worth it to me because I would just let it do it's thing as I got other housework done. Just let it bounce around long enough & it will usually get the whole room. I would then move it to another room & block it in there until it was done, ect. Within 6 months though, I was struggling to find a good spot on the charger. I cleaned everything well, kept moving it around on the charging port to get it to charge (spending so much time trying to get that right got old) Eventually, I'd also have to put some sort of object on top of it to get it to press into the charging station. The flimsy brush broke off within 8 months making it pretty useless at grabbing dust off the floor. I didn't feel like it was worth paying for a replacement part when the whole vacuum was clearly not going to last much longer. Finally one day when I took 30 mins just trying to get it in the right position, with the right item on top to get it to charge & then pulled out my trusty 10 year old corded vacuum to go back over almost everything the Roomba had covered..I realized it was time to call it a day. In fact, after that I went in to see it had given up charging. Again. Love the concept but even at the sale price, it wasn't worth the investment for so much work to keep it going & then having it totally useless w/in such a short time.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,2,Not a great Roomba .. buy a higher priced one!,"I fell for the low price and regret it. I have owned Roombas for more than a decade and my current one is starting to lose battery power. I decided to get the low priced one as a backup. I should have just popped for a new higher priced model. This thing has about 50% of the qualities of the others.. It has one brush roller while my old one has two. Everything about it is cheap, lightweight and seems fragile. It requires two full cycles to actually pick up debris and to cover the whole room. It failed to get small crumbs in the indentation of tile grout in the kitchen. Just went right over them. When I go over an area of the floor with a wet paper towel after the Roomba has gone over it, there are still small bits of dirt and dust. I missed the return window by 2 days or otherwise I would have sent it back and bought a more expensive one. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR is absolutely true. Spend the money for a better one!","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,2,Disappointing performance on hardwood floors in a pet free house.,"I've owned this Roomba for over a month now, previously I had a different brand (cheaper brand robot vacuum which I had to sell due to move), I bought this thinking it'd be an upgrade but that was a mistake. We have hard wood floors with 2 low pile and 1 medium pile rug, 2 kids, no pets. Set up: I bought it new and but had to perform a factory reset on it straight from the box to actually get it to work. Performance: This vacuum does a crappy job. It misses spots ALL the time, it's navigation of a room is NOT SYSTEMATIC, it hits the wall, then goes off in a different direction seemingly never to return. It doesn't have a volume control on the app, it's error messages are super obnoxious and loud, It woke me at 2am one night with 'LOW BATTERY PLEASE CHARGE' because it didn't dock properly. See video for lack of suction. I just cleaned the filter and emptied the tank before taking the video so you be the judge. Disappointing performance and purchase, do not recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,2,Not worth the money,"I had high hopes for this vacuum and I probably should've done more reading of reviews before making the purchase. I bought it for $350 and the only difference between this model and the ones below it are the self-emptying feature. Honestly, this Roomba is not much different from the one I had 10 years ago. I would recommend spending a little more or just vacuuming with a traditional vacuum. Pros: -The self-emptying feature is great as I don't have to empty it repeatedly. Cons: -The battery will not last a cleaning of 600+ sq feet. Basically, it couldn't clean my entire first floor. -No Smart mapping capabilities. I can't tell it to target a specific area that I feel needs more attention. -No ability to have it self-empty on demand. So if the battery dies, it will not empty until it's charged and cleans again. -Cannot accurately detect objects to avoid bumping into them. It constantly bumps into everything. In 2024 and at a price point of $400 you would think it would be able to navigate better. -Will take paint off your furniture. Neutral: -Wifi enabled is an expected feature in 2024 so this is no real benefit.","Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,2,Couldn't get it setup,"I think I would have like this unit, however I spent over 2 hours on their online support trying to get it setup on the App. First problem I couldn't find the Series it belongs in (not on unit, in manual or listed on line) and support couldn't tell me. That is the first question you are asked in the setup. The QR code couldn't be recognized when I scanned it. So I had to do manual set up. It can't use 5G WiFi so had to set WiFi connection to old 2.5G connection. Once I got through what setup I could get through, it was scanning to find the unit and it couldn't find the unit so set up wasn't completed. It was over 2 hours of pure frustration. That was after attempting to set it up myself for an hour. AT one point I hit a button during the setup and it took off on it's own and it did one swipe of an area rug and it did pick up quite well. But if set up won't work.....it can't be used. I had to return it.","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,2,Good for single room only`,"Too basic, too simply, frequently gets lost or stuck in locations that I really feel it shouldn't get stuck in. For instance, it gets stuck under the legs of my rolling chair because when it seems to realize it gets stuck it refuses to do anything except make 180+ degree rotations, which result in it continually aiming into the chair. If it did smaller rotations or simply backed up, it would get out of there no problem. It cleans real good, but its also a nuisance to clean the rollers and brush. The app is horrible. Legitimately embarrassing for such a major product manufacturer. Needless restrictions on setting schedules, no map, looks like crap. The robot does not have any sort of system or method of cleaning a room in an logical manner, it just bounces around the room at seemingly random angles until the battery runs low and it struggles to return home. What it is good at is cleaning a small area, like a single master bedroom. The actual cleaning action is good, it picks up a tremendous amount of dirt and my rooms carpet has never looked cleaner. I just with the clean carpets didn't come from such an obnoxious product.","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,2,Gets stuck a lot,"The price is decent compared to other robot vacuums, but I'm beginning to realize it's more trouble than it's worth. I find it gets stuck a lot (for example, it will vacuum the same spot over and over again because it can't figure out which direction to go in) and if i pick it up to move it to another part of the house, I get an error message and have to send it home (which it can rarely get to on its own). Also there's no functionality to control its movement via a remote or phone, which even cheaper beans have. Which is why I have to pick it up to get it to other parts of the house, which again, freezes it. Overall I do not recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,2,Meh,"I really wanted a Roomba, so I purchased this one, but wasn't all that impressed. It cleans well, when it's not getting stuck under something or vacuuming the same spots over and over and over. This one has no house mapping, so I would often find it vacuuming the same room or same spot repeatedly and have to manually move it. It wasn't hard to set up, and works well with my echo, but if I'm busy and just want to let it go to vacuum the house, i can't rely on it getting every room. After a few years it's kind of become a pain to charge. I make sure the contacts are cleaned and lined up and it with act like it is charging, but will stop after a few minutes. One day when I thought the battery was dead it turned itself on and started vacuuming my bedroom then died underneath the bed. I suppose it was a nice ""intro"" to Roomba at this price point, but I wish it performed a little bit better overall in terms of not hitting the same spots repeatedly or trying to go under areas it can't clear. There's also no way for it to detect the items it is vacuuming so I've found it trying to suck up socks and phone cables that got in its path - that's not entirely the roombas fault though. Overall, if you're between this model or a more expensive model that offers the house mapping and room selection, go for the higher end model because this one will just frustrate you.","Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,2,Not as good as i hoped,"First, I would likely buy this again but its not what I thought given the reviews/description. It does help control the disaster zone that is is my house: 2 cattle dogs, 1 Australian shepherd, 2 cats, 2 teenagers, etc. It does a decent job of picking up kitty litter, if you have cats this stuff just appears all over. I use this thing at least once a day since i purchased it 4 months ago… sometime 2 or 3 battery charges a day. We use a more powerful upright vacuum on the weekend though I would say it does not clean thoroughly at all. It drags and leaves clumps of Cattledog hair at the edge of carpets as it moves to hardwood…. I have to swiffer/sweep the edges of the hardwood/carpets to get up this 2” thick line of fluff. It regularly says it’s done or goes to its home WITH PLENTY of battery left and half the room isnt touched. You have to clean it out EVERY TIME you use it! Yes, sometimes multiple times in single use. My daughters’, wife’s, and Aussie shepherd’s hair seem to clog up the spinning brush bar pretty quickly. The Roomba gets stuck in weird random areas…. It goes under a dresser and gets stuck because it raises itself up upon exit. The Smart part… for us it’s not. We cannot connect it to our WI-FI because it needs a less secure encryption than we use on our router. Which is fine, I dont need a message telling me its stuck or that it thinks its done cleaning. I can hear it struggle and see its not done. Finally, the charging port connection has gotten really finicky. The Roomba wont charge unless its baby sat or weighted down. Strange but yes. Look it does some cleaning and it does it while my hands are busy doing something else… but it gets maybe 75% of the pet hair up and needs supervision while it works. Its not as great for our household as it is in others i guess.","Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,2,Not quite there yet,"I really wanted to love this and hoped it lived up to the hype. Maybe this is good for small areas but definitely not a house. I’ve had this for 7 months . I clean it regularly and keep it charged . If you’re meticulous in your cleaning I suggest you not watdh this thing in action the constant zig zag will drive you insane as it goes from one corner of the house and then to the other missing things and it takes 20 minutes to go back to the the next section .. it will spin in circles sometimes and has no rhyme or reason to it . You could easily vacuum yourself, this is more of a spot clean while you’re away and you can use the app to set it . As time progresses you would think this machine would learn its home.. it doesn’t . I spend more time chasing behind it as it will run for 4-5 min and say cleaning complete or hearing error move roomba . I have updated it as recommended and I do care for it as instructed . If you need to do your bedroom or a bathroom floor you will want to close the door so it can run around for an hour and actually get everything otherwise it’s hit or miss once it exits . I own a house so I use this upstairs I have a kitchen living room dining room bathroom and two bedrooms. I usually don’t use it in bedrooms . It’s too much space to cover and I have to run it multiple times since it wanders. If you own a house I suggest getting the more expensive model where it allows you to set boundaries this is not it. It’s lack of learning means if you have sofas with a gap or an entertainment stand it will constantly get stuck thus making the clean your home while you’re gone a waste . So for me this comes in handy when I’m up and cleaning other things and can get thie floors somewhat done while I do those things and run around and help the roomba every often after.the newness of your toy wears off you realize how inefficient your his becomes in your cleaning routine . It does do a good job with pet hair . I like the concept but not for the price thankfully I got this one on sale after black Friday or I would have given it one star for my use. I believe I need the top of the line model for my large area but after my experience with this one I would rather get a nice Dyson and go back To taking 15 minutes to vacuum my space .","Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2022"
B0CNKX4429,2,Buggy software = poltergeist Roomba,"This thing does a great job cleaning. It’s too bad the software is buggy and it starts by itself instead of according to the schedule. I have reset, redownloaded, deleted schedules then re-added them. Nothing works, so this vacuum has a mind of its own. One day I set it on the kitchen island after cleaning it out. I left the house for a hour and this thing decided to get to work pushing glasses, plates, fruit, etc off the counter. It did manage to stay on the counter itself, so the cliff detection definitely works!","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,2,Not worth it,"I bought this product to help with the chaos of cleaning when you have multiple pets but this just adds to it rather than help. Its sensors are not accurate. Sometimes it can get over the edge of the carpet and other times it thinks its an object in the way and turns around and goes back the other direction; never cleaning the carpet. If it gets caught under a chair or in the corner of a room it's unable to figure out how to get out, So i have to pick it up and move it. It has a home button that you push on your phone when you are reading for it to shut off and return to base. Nope. I push the home button multiple times and it just keeps cleaning. So again, I have to pick it up and turn it off manually and put it back on the charger myself. Its honestly just easier to get out the vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,2,Dirty Deeds almost done and not Cheap,"The pattern is erratic, gets stuck in locations - under a table, in a corner. I've run it 75 minutes and one location has yet to be touched. Can not be programmed of where to go or limit it to one room. Noisy, not as loud as a vacuum. Misses pieces. Constantly banging into furniture - not softly. Dirty Deeds done Dirt Cheap Roomba 694 – How does it clean? 1. It is not your mother, so it misses things. 2. Too large to fit in corners or between chair legs. Still need your big vacuum with attachments. This is a 3-inch-tall 13 in diameter round vacuum. 3. It doesn’t move the cat tree or dining room chairs to sweep under and around them. It gets stuck under an ottoman or in a corner. It runs an odd pattern which depends on when/where it bangs into something. 4. I spend an hour getting my house ready for this thing to run around bumping into walls, doors, furniture, cat dishes, any normal items found on the floor. 5. Guidance for the vacuum is – would you stop and ask for directions? It operates without any sense of where it cleaned before. It doesn’t realize the dirt is 2 inches to the left. The time it takes to vacuum 800sf is at least 90 minutes, the maximum time the robot runs on one outing because it goes to locations 10 time or more and still leaves dust. 6. As it runs around sweeping dust it gathers dust on its eyes or Soft touch sensors. I’m sure this creates a vision for the robot like driving in a downpour with no windshield wipers. Soft touch as a stone. 7. Maintenance –it’s a vacuum – wheels, brushes, sensors, filter in dust bin and empty dust bin. 8. Like any noisy appliance you appreciate the silence when it’s turned off. Cats still hiding half an hour later. 9. I sent an email to Roomba asking for help on the dust covering sensors and preventing the robot being stuck in locations.

I replaced the part, put the robot to work and within 30 seconds, the brush was off. After several attempts to fix it, I called customer service again. The rep was condescending, suggesting I don’t know how to use a screwdriver, then sent me an email requesting I PROVIDE PROOF that I bought and paid for the product.

B0CNKX4429,2,Dumb robot vacuum and didn't fully work,"We used the Roomba for about 1 month. It picked up a considerable amount of dirt and pet hair, however the schedules stopped working after a couple of weeks and the rollers and brushes don't last and have to constantly be replaced. Not because they are dirty (because they can be cleaned and reused, but the side brush especially breaks or loses bristles). We contact Roomba support about the schedules and were told to factory reset the robot and set it up from scratch. After doing this, the robot ran on the schedule for 1 day and quit again. Also, when the robot does run, it doesn't seem to learn anything about the room or environment and simply relies on being able to bang into things to go another direction. It often would just die somewhere in our house and not even know to go back ""home"" to charge itself. This is the whole point of this machine for us, but we always had to find out where it died and under which piece of furniture. Unacceptable! After also being advised by support after pointing out area rug damage that many areas rugs are not compatible with Roomba, we decided to ask for a return since the machine was simply not working for us but support dragged out case on for another two months asking for photo proof of our rugs, saying the robot ""should just work on the schedule"" and having no other advise or fix.

Dog hair not so much. The pictures show how dog hair piles up within the gaps between the brushes, as well as on the little wheel. It takes more time for me to clean the roomba than it would take to vacuum the floor myself, as you have to completely disassemble the whole pickup mechanism to clean it properly. The little yellow brush used to have three legs. Now it has two, and I have no idea how it broke. If you have normal dirt on the floor, this roomba is ok.

B0CNKX4429,2,Eeeeeh,"I bought this for Black Friday/cyber Monday season as I have animals and struggle with keeping up with hair. I’m pretty unimpressed with the results. Gonna start with the good parts: - I did find the set up pretty easy, from box to connecting to Wi-Fi and setting up a schedule, using the app, and just in general getting it started. All of it was fairly easy for me. -WHEN it works right, it does a good job. - it’s fairly quiet, I have it running early in the morning while I’m still asleep and I don’t hear it. Although it doesn’t run in my room. Now for the bad parts: - *My main thing* I would not recommend this for anyone with animals. Which is exactly what I needed it for, and what this product advertises as being good for. It does not handle pet hair well at all, the hair gets stuck in different parts of the roomba which makes it not work anymore. I have been trying to clean it more consistently than the “recommended” amount but the only way it’ll work properly is if I essentially deep clean every part of the roomba every day which really just defeats the purpose. I have to clean the brushes, the hair gets stuck in any little spot, in the wheels, but really mostly the ends of the brushes get really bad and as far as I can tell that’s what is stoping the roomba from working. Maybe it would be better with other type of fur, I do have a Husky, but it really doesn’t seem like this product can handle hair at all. - 8/10 times it doesn’t find its way back to base. I haven’t moved the base at all, it works around a fairly small living room area, and there isn’t much for it to work around. It’s not a deal breaker I just put it back on base and clean the dust compartment but it is not something I should be having to do. - the rotating bristles/brush part stopped working without the first couple days of having it and it’s the only part I haven’t figured out how to resolve. It doesn’t seem like there’s any hair stopping it from moving or anything damaged. - the base won’t properly stay in place which is probably part of why the roomba struggles to find home. I tried putting carpet tape under it but the roomba trying to adjust itself to properly “land” still pushes it out of place. My option is to get a small area rug to put under it according to the internet which I haven’t gotten to but it feels like a design flaw.

I picked up everything I thought it could get caught on pre-vacuuming. It would randomly skip sections of floor. It would leave pet hair behind. It could not find home base unless it was within 5 feet of it. The little plastic arm randomly popped off, and I would spend 20 minutes looking for it.

When she was operating, she did a good job of picking up pet hair and so I was well pleased. However, she was constantly getting ""stuck on a cliff"" where we have a step down to the mud room. I thought the robots learned how to avoid hazards like that? She also often ran out the battery during a job and didn't redock herself. I always had to find and dock her manually. In December I noticed she wasn't coming on, and the program said the battery needed to be charged or it couldn't find the signal. So Alice wasn't being docked properly. I would wait and see the ""charging"" signal come on (it only stays on for a second so you have to really watch for it), but apparently once I let go it wasn't attaching to the battery. I also have had to keep rebooting her. Finally got her to charge and programmed Alice to clean for 30 minutes. Noticed she kept going long after 30 minutes. I wanted her to- for once- dock herself- so I clicked ""send home."" The program said Alice was ""finishing up"" and returning home but she went on and on for at least another hour then finally docked herself.

Out of the 10 cycles I've tested it on, it has only successfully returned to its dock only one of the times. Regardless of repositioning the home station, restarting it, removing objects from it's path, reconnecting it to the wifi, etc., it will just wander around as if it's lost, so if I leave it alone, it will be dead in a random part of the house a majority of the time.

The customer service rep then informs me the part is out of stock and i have to wait.

It used to drive around it, now it wants to drive up onto it?!?! It also hasn't yet mapped my home. I can't tell it which tooms are which and just have it run a room at a time. Maybe I will never have that option but I thought it would...I guess I should've done more research before buying. It also can never seem to find it's base when it's done and/or needs to recharge. The only reason it gets a 2-star instead of a 1- star is that, when it's not stuck, it actuallly does an amazing job. I just wish I'd gotten one that was just a smidge smarter.","Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2023"
B0CNKX4429,2,Bumps into everything,"It constantly bumps into furniture with all its force. It even moves chairs, it's not programmed well enough to get out of corners or tricky places. The algorithm it follows is not very consistent, the paths it takes at every VERY random. I used toh have another brand and it was very smart and easy to control with a remote. For iRobot I can't e en conne t it to WiFi.","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,2,Less convenient than I hoped - stopped working after less than 2 years,"I've had my Roomba for about 9 months now, and to be honest, I'm a little disappointed with this model. Does it do its job as a vacuum? Yes, more or less. But this model is not something you can just set and forget - meaning that it's not as much of a time saver as you would think. On average, I have to ""rescue"" the Roomba about 5 times per session from going partly over the edge of the stairs, getting stuck on a dark rug, or somehow wedging itself under furniture. That means you can't just run it while you're out and come home to a clean house - you have to have someone around to watch it or it won't get the job done. Also, the brush assembly doesn't seem to be well designed. I find it stops turning every 3-5 times I run the Roomba, with no obvious direct cause (I'm not counting the times when something gets tangled). All in all, this does still save time, but not as much as I thought it would when I bought it. Granted, I live in a fairly small house. If you have more floor space, and especially larger open areas, this will probably be more efficient for you than it is for me. (Also, as a somewhat specific aside, this Roomba handles dark rugs very poorly. If the whole floor is very dark, it might be fine, but dark rugs tend to trigger the cliff sensor and ""confuse"" the Roomba. I understand the programming bias - you don't want the Roomba going over an actual edge, after all - but if you have dark rugs like we do, you may want to look for a more sophisticated model with higher-end sensors.) Edit: Our Roomba completely died after less than 2 years of infrequent use. Bumping down to 2 stars because this is clearly not a product that is built to last.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2022"
B0CNKX4429,2,Disappointed,"I've had it now for a little less than a year and when it runs, it's fine. But the app is not user friendly (for a non techie- that is )and rarely does it return to its base, and rarely does it connect correctly to the charger when it does. So... Most of the time I'm carrying it back home. Most of the time when I want to use it, it's dead and most of the time when I try to send it home from the app, it continues to wander around till the battery dies. I wouldn't buy it again.","Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,2,Unreliable/unpredictable,"I have had this Roomba for about a year, every month I have to reset the start time on the schedule because it just stops working and it seems that it is the only way to restart it. The charging contacts do not align properly, if not charged then the Roomba would send alert “Please charge Roomba” , it does not matter at what time of day or night!. It cleans well thus the 2 stars but the app does not seem to control it well.

B0CNKX4429,2,Bought 2 after 6 months both are now dead,"I bought 2 of these, one for upstairs and one for downstairs. When they arrived one didn't work at all. Wouldn't turn on or even charge. That one got sent back and refunded. This second one has been working for the last 6 months. It did a mediocre job of cleaning the floors. It would always use 75% of it's time cleaning 25% of the room. It would get itself ""stuck"" on non-existent things every single time I turned it on. I would have to pick it up and then set it back down (usually in the exact same spot) to continue cleaning. I could never turn it on and leave the house (which is why I bought it). Now it doesn't charge, just like the first one. This one is going in the trash. The app is also a disappointment. It doesn't connect to this model, so it's completely useless. It takes me less time and frustration to do it the old fashioned way, and I obviously do a better job than it does. I know Rumba makes more expensive, and more advanced models of vacuums, but after this experience I won't be spending any more money on this technology.","Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,2,Lightweight but will move items,"I was really excited to receive my robot vacuum. When I took it out of the package, it was super lightweight. I was worried about the suction/ability to pick things up. Which, it does do a good job with picking things up. What I personally would not be able to stand is that this will not go around some obstacles. It moved my roller kitchen chairs around and moved my garage can from its spot. I do not want to come home and have to rearrange my kitchen but putting everything back to where it's supposed to be. Also, after the vacuum was finished and going back to the charging spot, it took almost as much time to go back to the charger than it did to vacuum everything. Finally, the map that came up after getting done, did not replicate what my house layout is or where it actually went.","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024"

Once it hits a flat edge it beats its face against it trying to find the corner like a blind man in a maze. I see other robot vacuums make these nice, even lines in the carpet when it done. Not this one, this one looks like a retarded kids coloring page. I have to set the thing to run while I’m at work for fear I’ll just office space this turd. Most of the time I find it stuck somewhere stupid, but since you’re up you might as well clean the brushes and bin. Which is maybe one of its saving graces, it’s pretty easy to do.

B0CNKX4429,2,Dumb robot,"So I’ve had this robot for about a month after my last one died and I honestly should’ve just replaced the same one I had. This one had such a good sale which is the only reason I bought it. When I say this is a dumb robot, this is a DUMB robot. It can never find its way back home, it gets stuck on everything (any small ledge, it gets stuck on), it does not have a mapping feature, which is so freaking nice because I have to close every door I don’t want it going into. The robot also does not follow any type of pattern at all. It misses a lot of dirt by doing that. The only saving grace about this thing is that the suction feature is amazing. If I could afford it, I would absolutely return this thing and get another version of my old vacuum.

B0CNKX4429,2,Okay when it’s working but not great,"I’ve had this irobot for about 7 months now and it worked pretty decently the first few months. This irobot only cleans when it wants, often time starting at random times when it’s not scheduled to clean. It’s woken us up randomly at 2am. I’ve even tried turning off its schedule and manually starting it when needed but it still starts randomly. When started manually, it will sometimes clean for less than a minute and dock itself announcing its completed a job. It often gets stuck under our dishwasher and the base of our coat rack. It will only pick a few spots to clean for hours and half of the time dies before making it back to its dock. We have 5 cats and 1 dog, three of which shed quite a bit. We got this irobot to help with the pet fur between our regular vacuuming. It doesn’t handle the fur very well at all. The brushes get jammed after one or two full cleaning and the whole thing needs to be taken out to remove all the fur, even though it’s tank isn’t full. If you don’t clean it out regularly, it will start the next day and then stop announcing it needs to be cleaned. The irobot only has to clean about half of the house, it doesn’t have access to 3 bedrooms (which the cats spend the majority of their time), 2 bathrooms, and the laundry room. When it is working properly and you open it up and clean it out regularly, it does help out a bit and can prevent dirt and fur build up between regular vacuuming.","Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2023"

We have to place a binder under the back end to get it to connect. (See photo). Spoke to customer service and because we are just over our year mark, there is no warranty. They offer a trade in or can fix for $250 (basically same price as a new one).

I have one room I needed it to work on. It constantly bumped into things and just kept bumping into them until I turned it around. Sometimes it would go a different direction, but usually it just went back to the same spot and got stuck again. It's never been able to find it's way back home, even when I placed it just a few inches from it. It's currently laying upside down on the floor because it won't shut off.

I have had this model for 2 years and a few weeks and it went from working fine to dying mid-job, reporting error 6, and refusing to restart.

B0CNKX4429,2,Useless and untrainable,"Let me start by saying something positive: it vacuums pretty well. Everything else a vacuum robot os supposed to do, it can't do. It won't stay connected to the WiFi, which renders it uncontrollable without physically walking with it. It can't sense any surroundings. It can't map anything, it won't stick to a schedule, and it won't stay off when asked to stay off. It is just as loud as an upright vacuum cleaner. My wife and I both work at home, so it can't run while we are working. It constantly gets stuck in the same spots and has to be rescued. And once rescued, when it needs to go back to its base, it can't find it. It has no pattern and cleans the same areas over and over. It's actually mind boggling watching it repeat the same areas, and get stuck in the same spots. I sent it back after 3 weeks of trying to make ut work, and ordered a Shark. Great decision. It is everything this pile junk is not. and runs at about 1/3 the volume. Unless you need your blood pressure raised, and enjoy being needed by a rolling fetch toy, you should keep looking.

My husband has an Android, I have an iPhone, and we have a great router that has both 2.4 / 5 G options, and we tried everything - messing with Wifi/ router settings, hotspotting our phones, reinstalling/rebooting, spending a couple hours on the internet and then with tech support.

After locating it I had to pull out the big heavy sofa to rescue it and almost broke a lamp in the process. Next I tried letting it do the kitchen. It got stuck under the stove. I used a broom handle this time to get it out since I can't move out the stove. It's a big 48 inch unit with connected gas. Next I put it in the family room to clean up after our cockatiel. It stayed in the same 5 square foot section because it can't navigate the thicker rugs in there. It does handle the dining room and LR rugs. Then I tried the home function and put it into the room with it's charger and it was lost until I actually placed it within 6 inches of the charging station. Then it parked itself.

I gave it my loft to vacuum, a single small open room, totally disconnected from all other rooms. Room doesn't get a ton of use, I typically vacuum it once a week for about 5 minutes. Having used the roomba for a few months I have to say I do not get the point of this thing. It spends 30-60 minutes to poorly vacuum half the room. It bounces off objects, turns randomly, and then proceeds to go over the same spots over and over, while managing to entirely avoid large chunks of the carpet. Environmentally this thing must be a disaster. It runs for hours to do a job you can do in minutes. Videogame AI's have been successfully able to navigate dynamically generated maps for over a decade. This thing couldn't find the ground if you threw it off the roof.

The primary features you want, that this model lacks is advanced navigation, mapping, and a higher capacity dirt bin. This literally bounces around from wall to wall (going over the same area like 20 times) to clean a room. This might work well for cleaning a large open room, but for doing a whole house it is terrible. It gets stuck quite frequently as well. We replaced it with a Roomba J7, and couldn't be happier. The newer vacuums hardly ever get stuck, and they clean in half the time by mapping the rooms - meaning they clean in rows.

B0CNKX4429,2,It's not great but it makes do,"It works well for a self guiding vacuum but that's about all that it has going for it. Unless you have 90% wooden floors in your home, I would not recommend. It does okay with suction but it's nothing worth to brag about. Because it is self guiding it misses a lot of middle area within the home. For instance, hallways will have the sides vacuumed but it won't turn around and vacuum the middle area. If you want it to clean a specific spot in your home, good luck. You can place the Roomba on or near the specific spot, but most times it will try to figure out where it is instead of going over the area you have placed it. Also isn't great if you have a lot of furniture, loose chords, or an easily accessible under the bed area that may have a few lost socks. Given all of the negatives, it does adequate work considering you yourself don't have to vacuum and adequate meaning it will clean only so much but because it runs in circles of areas it cleans, it's surprisingly thorough, to a degree.

The app function is unreliable and the vacuum is not consistently responsive to commands from the app. The vacuum will not reliably return to its base when the battery is depleted. Neither the app or the Alexa connection are functional now and the ""help"" on the app isn't very helpful. I must start and replace the vacuum from the charging station manually.

It will jet past obvious debris and instead vacuum the same spots repeatedly.

It's been 12 minutes and it's already gotten stuck 3 times, even after I've closed doors and but up blockades. With the trouble it gives me I might as well just manually vacuum like I always did cuz it saves time and frustration. It was supposed to be easier but I think I'll just invest in a cordless vacuum next time. Definitely disappointed. Literally now as I finished typing this it got stuck again. Don't bother!

I purchased this new one thinking after so many years it must have improved but I was wrong. First of all, the charging station indicator light goes off after a few seconds, so you have no way of knowing if the charger is working or not. Second, the roomba has no indication if it is fully charged or not. Third the app also doesn’t have much use besides controlling it using your phone. Lastly the roomba never returns back to station after pressing home button, it just keep running around randomly. Even when it is close to home it just turns away and go somewhere else. The app tells you it is finishing up, not sure why it never finishes.

However I’ve had difficulty connecting the app to the roomba. It’ll be stuck on “connecting” and not allow me to send the device home even after it already elapsed the time amount I wanted it to run. It also will not go into multiple rooms. So I’ve had to pick it up and move it (I might as well sweep if im doing all of this.) lastly, and the most annoying thing is no matter where I put the dock - it can’t return home for the life of it. This leaves me hesitant to automate the cleaning for when im not home because I don’t want to annoy my neighbors when it runs all day because it can’t find the dock.

B0CNKX4429,2,Hoped for more,"I bought this roomba for my office, which has vinyl flooring and 2 rugs, thinking it would be able to keep the dust at bay. The space the roomba has access to is approximately 1000-SF. We don’t wear shoes beyond the entry door so it should be able to keep the dark vinyl floors clean, but it doesn’t do a good job. After a cleaning, I can still see dust in some of the open areas. Maybe this roomba is best suited for carpets because it gives the floors only a light dusting. It BANGS into furniture so hard that I had to move some items from a side table to a bookshelf. It frequently bangs into the charging station so hard that it dislodges the charging cable. When I arrive at the office, I have to help it find the docking station so it can charge and/or I plug the cable back into the charging/docking station. During each cleaning cycle, it gets stuck on the cable cover, which has a low rise that meets accessibility height requirements. The roomba SHOULD be able to maneuver over it, but has been getting stuck (“over a cliff”) every week. I am disappointed in this unit. I’ve only had it for 4 months and it’s not “sweeping” (which is what I wanted) very well. It’s time to look for another solution.","Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2022"

I have pets and it maybe gets up half the hair. I routinely have to go back with a regular vacuum, which defeats the purpose of buying this. The most annoying thing about this vacuum is it rarely sends itself back to its charging port and just stops somewhere in the house when the battery is depleted. I have to find it and then take it back to the base. Trying to line it up on the base so that it will charge is near impossible.

B0CNKX4429,1,Dont buy it,"This is my first experience with an iRobot brand and I have to say its so poor I may never purchase another product by them. Where to even begin? I previously had an iON brand unit I picked up at walmart on sale for $69 it was amazing and for $69 we could not complain. After two years of working hard and being abused by my boys if finally started making noises and it was time. So I thought moving to a $100+ name brand unit was going to be an upgrade. Not even close. 1. This unit only has one side brush unlike my other unit that had one on each side, so unless its approaching the wall or nook and cranny from the right direction it does not grab anything near the wall or door or corner of the room. 2. Its constantly getting stuck, the height of the unit is just enough that if you have a hard wood floor that was laid after your cabinets the space between the floor and the base of the kitchen cabinet is just enough for the downward angle of the unit to get wedged and its stuck. If you have a piece of furniture with say a box, or laundry hamper just smaller than the width of the unit next to it the unit sometimes will get stuck in a perpetual loop of turning around and running into the same piece of furniture then doing it all over again and never leaves that couple of square feet. 3. The APP is horrible. Very few customization settings, my old iON unit i could fully remote control the unit like an RC car, I could also adjust the vacuum suction, its overall travel speed and much more. With this APP you can locate the unit if its stuck (that is often) and change its suction. That is about it. 4. Wedges under every couch we have. If you happen to have one of those electric recliners where its slightly higher from the floor than most this unit will wedge itself under the back every time it passes by. (see picture) 5. The brush is constantly turning on an off, I assume this is a battery feature, however its very annoying and it does not seem to clean as well with this occurring (again you cant change it in the app). 6. The ""human voice"" (if you want to call it that) that communicates various issues to you such as ""please place on a flat surface"" or tells you there is a problem, is extremely LOUD. Even more so than the unit running by ten fold. So there is no chance your going to run this unit at night and sleep without nightmares of a robot taking you in your sleep. Bottom line is this unit does the job, however you have to babysit it so much its almost easier to just get out the vacuum and do it by hand. There are a few rooms that don't trigger the unit getting stuck or calling for help for random reasons, so we do use it there. However for the price, your better off getting one of the off brand units for sure. Use it in rooms that have no cabinets, couches, or furniture with a curved leg (it likes to treat the curved leg like a dog in heat if you know what I mean and gets stuck). I WOULD RECCOMEND purchasing something else..","Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,1,Terrible robot vacuum experience. Not what I expected from Roomba. Returned it.,"I decided to replace my old Roomba as it was beginning to have some parts that pieces were breaking off. I was excited to get this one and ordered it on Prime Day in October at the sale price. It was one of several robot vacuums in my wish list since I had done lots of research and gone through lots of reviews. I had tried a combo vacuum/mop unit before and it was awful, but it was a different brand and did worse than this thing. Right out of the box it would not connect to Wi-Fi or Alexa. I had to perform a factory reset to get it to connect. You do that by holding down all three buttons on the top, simultaneously, for about 10 seconds until you hear a series of sounds. You are then required to let it charge for best results, so I let it charge almost 24 hours. The app never would show the “Product Health”, even after using the vacuum. I would only get the notice in the screenshot shown. I did use the app to start the first vacuuming. I felt I was off to a good start as the robot began vacuuming in the grid pattern as shown in the ad. Once that pattern led it into my living room, things changed dramatically, for the worse. It should be noted that I do not have a bunch of clutter. I lost my fur baby soulmate, but still have not removed his bed (seen in the movie). There is really not a lot of difficult navigation. I included the movie because it was at the start of the vacuuming, and I was pleased with the low noise level. It was less noisy than my old one at least. Once in the living room, it got stuck under the chair. I got it unstuck and restarted it. It was not 45 seconds later, and it got stuck in the exact same place. It actually had to force its way into the location that it kept getting stuck in. I got it free and completely moved it to a different area. It wasn’t long and it returned, but this time I moved it again before it got stuck. Then it would go into an area by my dog’s bed and would just stay in that area, going to and fro as if stuck in a large box. It would spin, it would go backwards, it would go forwards, and it would spin some more. I thought perhaps it was due to the small AC/Heat vent in the floor, so I covered that vent with the dog’s bed. But this was to no avail. It was bound and determined to stay in that 3x3 feet area. I moved it again. It stayed in the room that it started in (adjacent to my living room where it kept getting stuck) for a few minutes and then came back into the living room. This was an hour and 14 minutes, it did less than 400 square feet of vacuuming, and I used the app to send it home to its base. It picked up some dirt (shown). I liked the size of the dirt bin and the ease of emptying it. The noise level and the size of the dirt bin were the only things I liked about this Roomba. I realize that it is on the cheaper end of the scale for a Roomba, but I expected more! I returned this vacuum. I will wait until Prime Days for Christmas and order something different, and probably not a Roomba!","Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,1,A solid product hindered by suboptimal app behavior,"The actual Roomba itself is a solid product. I had forgotten that iRobot started as more of a robotics company rather than focusing on appliances. The wheels on the Roomba are designed in a way that makes them resistant to pet hair, or incredibly easy to clean in the case of the front caster. Our dog is a rather large mix with Great Pyrenees, so the hair burden for the little Roomba is rather high. I generally open the roller unit and remove most of the hair after the Roomba has run, just to keep it maintained. For a 900 sq ft house, even just 15 minutes a day will keep hair largely under control, where the Roomba is able to reach. Additionally, Roomba designs the devices in a way that components that do fail are fairly easy to replace after removing 4 Phillips screws. The cons arrive when we examine the app, and how the Roomba interacts with it. Getting the Roomba to connect to the internet and stay connected to the internet was an hour long chore, even though the router was across the room from it. Additionally, instructions are often ""creatively reinterpreted;"" that is to say, completely ignored. I'll request clean with no time limit, and the Roomba will get to exactly the minimum 15 minute time limit, announce that it is finished, and put itself away. I'll request a 30 minute cleaning, the app will acknowledge that yes, it has been over 45 minutes, and the Roomba still has not even acknowledged that the time limit has arrived and passed, let alone entered ""finishing up"" mode or attempting to put itself away. Sometimes I'll have to start a ""New Job"" two or three times before the Roomba acknowledges it without timing back out to ""Ready to clean."" Basically, the appliance itself does pretty solid work, and ownership should actually be pleasant compared to today's standards. The app has timers to track when you should be replacing consumables which I haven't encountered yet, but I imagine the nagging will be an experience to remember. As for using that app to interact with the Roomba... be prepared to exercise patience and do a lot of thinking and supervising that you honestly shouldn't have to. Edit: As time has gone on, the app has become more and more unreliable and frustrating. I want to rate this product well because of the thought that went into the hardware, but it is absolutely crippled by terrible software and a company that got so fat and lazy on government contracts that they stopped innovating or caring about commercial quality. Go buy a roborock, or even a Shark or eufy.","Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2023"
B0CNKX4429,1,Almost useless,"Does this vacuum work... yes. It picks things up. Is it good at what it does.. absolutely not. This vacuum is like having a toddler. Constantly getting stuck, can't get out of a 3 sides square. Because the sensors that let it know it bumped into something sucks. It will keep driving. This causes it to either push a chair, even an ottoman on hard wood floors. And once it starts to push things. It looses traction and starts sliding around. Once that happens 1 time. It looses it sense of what it was doing. I watched this thing for over 20 minutes try and get out of a 3 sided shallow location. Every time it would hit the side, it would slide sideways loosing it's sense of direction. Then when it attempts to correct itself it end up going right back into the same situation. Constantly repeating the same actions. Never trying a new direction. I have to constantly pick it up, move it just so it would vacuum other spots. It even could not get out of my kitchen. It would constantly travel the same 7 feet, hit an edge, slide to the side, then turn around and repeat the same movements until I had to physically move someplace else. I have mostly an open floor plan and it can not even navigate around it without getting into some stupid repeating pattern. I will give this a couple more tries. But I'm 99% sure I am going to return it. Update 10/14/24. I am returning this u it. I noticed that if the home base is not in direct line of site when it is done or told to go home. It cannot find it. Also this unit got stuck in a corner with nothing around it. It just kept repeating the same pattern into the corner until it eventually errored out and shut down. I checked in on this with my security camera in the dark. It has 3 infrared sensors. Not enough for this unit apparently. I don't know if more expensive models are any better.

B0CNKX4429,1,Not good for hair/fur,"I'm not sure the amount of time I spend doing surgery on this thing actually saves me any time in the end. I have long hair. I have animals with long hair. One would think a vacuum of any kind would not only be built to pick up hair but make the removal of hair from said vacuum rather easy - but NO. Hair and fur will get wound around literally any moving part of this machine - places you can't get it out of - like the wheels. The brush is nearly impossible to get clean considering the design of the soft bristles. Also the noise. Oh my gosh. It's like an angry, overweight, drunk uncle just in from a night down the pub. It rams into everything with a loud bang, then when faced with the smallest inconvenience, it will stop, beep and start yelling in I don't even know what language - Dutch maybe? And I don't know how to change it. The filter is always clogged - again something one would think a vacuum is designed to handle - dirt and dust. You can try knocking it against the garbage can to shake it loose but your Roomba will insist this is not good enough and the app will tell you the filter needs to be replaced. It can also never find its way ""home"" when it's either running low on battery or you send it home through the app. It doesn't ""map"" anything; it just blindly bumps around into walls and furniture, overturning water bowls and denting soft wood—see drunk uncle simile. Like someone else said, it's a ""helper"" in the most minimal use of the word. It runs while I work which does help, but it doesn't cover every square inch, it doesn't pick up everything, and I know when I'm done with work I'll have to break out the scissors and perform a cleaning surgery again.","Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,1,Pretty terrible,"I bought one of these to replace an aging Eufy 30S and so far nothing but regrets. In 2023, for a company as big as this, the app is inexcusably bad. It gives pretty much zero control. I wouldn't need it if the Roomba didn't spend an inordinate amount of time humping and abusing my furniture. It seems to spend about half its time edge cleaning, and about the other half aimlessly wandering. What makes it all worse is that I had to go set up an account, create and store a password, give it my wifi info, etc. Waste of time. Really. The only control on the app is pause. Well, I can make it go home too, but when it gets in one of its moods and starts going at things in the room, I either have to go rescue whatever it's bullying or let it have its way. Why not include some basic steering functions? Or at least a go do something different feature? Why is the app even there? I mean, they've streamlined the process on there to buy things to replace parts, but basic functionality is missing. I guess I can control it from anywhere with wifi, but I don't trust it enough to run on its own. It also attacks its base when it feels like it. Repeatedly. I sat and watched it attempt to dock for about 10 minutes this other time. I really can't find anything good to say about it. Well, I'll take that back. It does vacuum a little better than the Eufy, maybe because new parts, but it's twice as loud. I tried to return it, but was only offered up to 50% of the purchase price so I guess I'm stuck with it. This is my 2nd Roomba. I have one of the 1st gens. I'd still be using it if I could find good batteries, but I gave up on that. The 1st gen was better. Even with NiCd batteries, no wifi (why? It doesn't do anything!), and 15+ years old - it's still better than this one. I'd hoped that with that much time they'd have figured these things out, but was wrong. This will be my last one.

B0CNKX4429,1,Worthless piece of trash,"Why does this even exist? It will bump around like a drunken sailor for a half hour, then declare that it has a low battery and must be charged. But worse than that - it has obsessively pulled on any loose threads in my rug, essentially destroying it. I left it charging for a month, and when I decided to try it again (rolling up my rug to keep it from being further destroyed) it wouldn’t start, I checked the app and it said it had a low battery. It charged up and then declared low battery again after doing a very small portion of the room, spending most of its time bumping into things and going back over places it already cleaned but ignoring the parts of the room that it hadn’t cleaned. I haven’t gotten any useful customer service either - I’ve tried contacting them multiple times.

B0CNKX4429,1,More trouble than it’s worth,"I love that it cleans my floors on a schedule. However, this thing gets stuck on absolutely anything and everything. There is a spot near my dishwasher where I guess the tile doesn’t go all the way forward (not visible with the naked eye), and it gets stuck on a “cliff” there. You can’t know that before you get it, and there is no way to avoid that area with this model. Worst of all, when it gets stuck, the machine will randomly notify you in the middle of the night, which is incredibly creepy and disruptive. There is no way to turn that off, and the last thing I want to do in the middle of the night is crawl under my bed because it got stuck on a hair scrunci. The cleaning function itself works well. it’s a little loud, but I just set the schedule to when I’m out of the house. It doesn’t work well under a table with chairs; while there is technically room for it to get everything under there, it usually just leaves the area, and over days you can see build up of little crumbs. If you keep your floors perfect (absolutely nothing on them out of place, no phone chargers, kids socks, tiny toys, etc., then this might be for you. If that’s not you, but you can splurge, just get the highest end model. Aside from that, I don’t recommend this product. I almost feel like they keep this one around to frustrate us and make us want to buy the highest one, sometimes going for over $1000. If they would just silence the middle of the night notifications I could probably live with it, so this is absolutely fixable by the company with some updates.

However, syncing it to my phone was not easy at all. Once that was finally done, the app showed the vacuum as fully charged, so I decided to take it for a spin. It made the expected tone, signalling it was leaving its base; it backed up about four inches, then lost power and stopped. There were no lights on any of the control buttons, so even when I pushed the dock button, the vacuum didn't budge. I moved it back onto the chargers, and tried again. I did this several times, and it never got fully off the dock. I thought, maybe it *isn't* fully charged, so i left it till the next day and tried again - same result. It never got off the dock and kept power. I was very disappointed. Rather than make myself crazy trying to figure out what's wrong with the vacuum, I'm going to return it. I've already purchased another brand and model which cost more, but arrived in a day, was incredibly simple to set up and sync, and works great.","Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,1,Would Not Recommend Roomba,"1. Instructions not clear-nowhere on the instructions does it tell you what to do with the little green plastic Spinny wheel brush and where to put it. You have to look at the picture on the box to see what to do with it. It also does not tell you that you have to remove the two white plastic pieces that come on the Roomba that looks like it’s part of the Roomba. 2. I had to factory reset the Roomba before the first use. It was already on someone else’s account. Talk about a long painful process. Ughhh 3. Could not use the app without Turing my WiFi off. I had to use my phone plan to use the Roomba app, which by turning off my Wi-Fi, I could not use any other items in my house example google Nest ,Pandora, cameras..etc. Then since I turned off my WiFi my phone would not connect to my car until I turned my WiFi back on. I should not have to turn my WiFi off to use the Roomba app. 3. Roomba got stuck sooooooo many times. Then, once it gets stuck, it turns off and the search is on to find out where Roomba is at. Good luck! 4. Roomba just keeps going over the same areas… over and over again. What about the rest of the house???? So, Roomba has been returned.","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,1,TERRIBLE!,"I had a Roomba 900 for about 4 to 5 years, until it finally died. The 900 wasn’t perfect but I’d give it a 9.5 out of ten. So, I buy this one and what a complete disappointment. It simply could not find the charger when the charge got too low, which was in the exact same spot as the 900 used. I got tech support on the phone. They told me to move it. We did a live video so he could direct me. A spot was chosen. STILL NO GOOD the next time I ran it. It simply wandered around the house until its battery died. I returned that one Amazon and using the refund, bought another as I simply couldn’t believe it could be this bad as a model given my experience with the 900. This particular unit must be defective? The new Q011 arrived and THE EXACT SAME THING. It too was returned and I’m done with Roomba.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,1,"Ok, i change my mind - i'm returning this thing - DO NOT BUY","First off, getting it to connect with my home WiFi was super frustrating. Took over 30 mins. But ok, it finally worked. But the thing itself literally works maybe 10 percent of the time. The rest? It'll get stuck on a less than 1/4 inch ""ridge"" (the edge of a carpet, say) and it'll just sit there until you get home. seriously. nothing stuck in its wheels, nothing its wheels shouldn't be able to roll over. but there it sits. useless. Worse yet, it BELLOWS some error message, meaning, yes, your neighbors will hear the dumb thing SHOUTING its robotic error message for HOURS until you come home. Plus, getting it to return to its home base (on the one in ten times that the thing does work) takes some doing if you're trying to operate it through the APP (as opposed to being home and just pressing the ""home"" button on it). I have to hit ""pause"" like 5 times before it finally takes and gives me the option to send it back to its base. Plus, there are times when it's sitting on its base, showing no error, but when you go through the app to start cleaning, it'll give you some random error message about the bin not being properly in place or something (i couldn't figure out the issue. and if there was a problem with the bin, why not provide an error message WHEN IT HAPPENS?). OR, you'll start a cleaning job, close the app, and come home to find that nope, it's just sitting in its base. no cleaning done. And before you ask, yes, i've updated the app. it's just a shoddy piece of technology that doesn't work for its intended purpose - to vacuum when you're not home. because you have to babysit it every step of the way.","Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2023"
B0CNKX4429,1,Absolute Trash,"I don't often rate things poorly, but this thing is the single worst purchase I've made on Amazon. Where do I even begin? 1) It's extremely loud. We have to leave the main floor of the house when we turn it on, otherwise we are just yelling at each other. 2) When it's not deafening us with the suction sound, it's screeching some sort of recorded message about why it can't do what you want it to do. 3) Sensing is awful. It will throw itself down the stairs if you don't put a line of objects in front of them. Then again, I would consider throwing myself down the stairs too if I was this bad at everything. 4) The charging situation. The number of times I have put it on the charger, it has given me the confirmation that it's charging, then I come back and it tells me that I was 1mm off and it needs to charge is wayyyy too high. Like every time. Why give me the confirmation that it's charging if it's not charging? 5) It just doesn't do a good job at picking things up. And forget about getting the debris close to the wall. 6) One of the tines of the brush has already broken off. We had a Eufy vac for 4 years before the battery gave out. It wasn't perfect, but it did the job. I chose to go with another brand because Eufy got caught giving security camera info to the government and I didn't want to support a company that does that. Looks like I should have just sold all my secrets instead of buying this piece of junk. I would say buyers beware, but you probably can't hear me over this vac.","Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2023"
B0CNKX4429,1,"Dumb robot, still prefer the 12 year old 655","I got a new roomba because I thought that maintenance broke my 655, it got into some caulk and they locked it in the bathroom. I was compensated for the damages and they told me to buy a new one. I repaired the 655 but thought it would be great to have a “fancy” new model. I don’t mind that this one is slower than the 655, the 655 has a habit of mashing itself into walls but it gets the job done. What I do mind is that this one’s “neat lines” are super inefficient and it starts spinning mindlessly to try to find itself. I’ve had it for two weeks now and it keeps getting stuck going back and forth in corners. It also decided to get stuck somewhere and completely gouge its exterior. I typically don’t mind little bumps and scratches here and there but come on this is a brand new robot. I also hate that it can’t just move toward the dock, it has to get as far back as it can and then aim for the dock. I think the only positives I have here is that I can schedule it (I can also schedule the 655 without wifi). I also like the suction power on it, but it’s also about the same as its predecessor. The only difference with this one is that I can use Alexa with it, but if I had the option to not need to connect it to wifi I wouldn’t. TL;DR: save your money and try to find a second hand roomba like I did initially. It’s an investment to get the replacement parts needed and a new battery but it’s nothing compared to the price of a new model.","Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,1,Don't buy this,"I've had this model of the Roomba since January and I regret buying it pretty much every time I run it. This thing is so DUMB. You have to pretty much pick up everything off the floor before using it, otherwise it will try to suck it up and get stuck, and I mean everything. Shoes, backpacks, cords, stuff you'd think a robot vacuum would never go after. It also has no sense of direction/mapping so unless you're home to guide it where to go, it will likely stay in the same corner of a room for about 20 minutes. It gets under my desk and bumps in between the legs back and forth for almost the entire cycle if I don't move it, which defeats the entire point. And now, the thing is having mechanical issues and is dropping dirt everywhere. Haven't even had it for a year yet. I think I would've been better off with a $50 vacuum from Target instead of this thing.","Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,1,Not worth the money!!,"My girlfriend wanted this for our house because we have 5 kids and keeping the floors clean is a task. I read the reviews, they seemed good, so I was excited about the new purchase. However, it is not what I expected and I’m very disappointed. The vacuum actually does a pretty good job at sucking stuff up, so I will give credit where due. The issue is out of the 38 cleaning jobs it’s started, it has yet to complete one. I go over the entire floor every morning to make sure there’s no wires, shoe laces, or anything else that could get it stuck but that doesn’t matter. Every single time I come home it’s just sitting in the middle of the floor because the battery died. These have a home charging base, so I would expect it to go home before dying. Never happens. It has a button on the top that directs it to go back to its base, but even using that it does absolutely nothing but go in circles. The video attached shows a very small clip of it going it circles, in the same spot, after I pushed the home button. I’ve restarted it, unplugged the base, reinstalled the app, and every problem solving technique they say to use. I’m not sure if it’s supposed to somewhat map the space it cleans, but it definitely doesn’t. It just goes in circles in the same exact spot. Some of their other models might be better because they definitely have a cool technology, but this series needs a lot of work.","Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,1,Unable to maneuver over floor vents or area rugs,"I had hoped that a robotic vacuum designed for floors and rugs, would not get hung up on area rugs or floor vents that live on the floor, but sadly, I was wrong. I have to ""rescue"" this stupid thing at least 4 times every cycle, EVERY DAY, because it continuously gets hung up on my very low profile rugs and every floor vent in my house. It ignores the home button. When I push try and send it home because I'm tired of rescuing it, it continues on whatever route it has planned, usually in the complete opposite direction of it it's base, and invariably dies dead center, under the king sized bed. Of the times I pick it up and carry it to it's base, it doesn't want to stay there and will keep trying to vacuum and I have to spend 10 minutes fighting with it to stay on the charger, or uncouple itself from the charging points and then doesn't charge for the next day.

B0CNKX4429,1,I Wanted to Like It,"I have wood floors with several thin mats for my old, arthritic dog who has a hard time keeping her balance on the floors. I would tell you how the Roomba cleans the mats but I don’t know - it never got to them. My confused Roomba had some issue that caused it to go around and around in circles. The first time I used it, Roomba repeatedly went in and out under a cabinet - which I appreciated to a point since i hadn’t vacuumed under it for a while. The second try seemed better - I ran it during the night to not upset my dog - woke up to Roomba in the middle of the floor with a partially filled dust cup. I took that as a win. Round three, while I watched the robot and the dog, was not a win. Roomba ran in a circle in the kitchen - for so long that my dog was no longer bothered by it and walked past it to check her bowls. I moved it to the sunroom - same circular movement. Roomba was returned. Before buying the Roomba I researched different robotic vacuums for their ability to deal with pet hair - the Roomba 694 was highly rated. My expectation for the Roomba was fairly low - run it daily to remove the clumps of dog hair on the floor. I wasn’t expecting dustless floors and mats: just less dog hair on the floor. On a positive note, it does excel at spot cleaning!🤦🏻‍♀️ For full disclosure, I purchased the Roomba from Amazon Warehouse in used, like new condition. Amazon’s definition of Used, Like New is “An item in perfect working condition.” I suspect neither Amazon nor iRobot would consider this Roomba in perfect working condition. I’ve purchased other items in the same condition; this is the first item I’ve been dissatisfied with and returned.","Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2022"

It's quieter than our old one, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Sadly, it also seems confused about how to re-dock...it inches right and left for a few minutes while deciding which angle to back in at.

B0CNKX4429,1,Stick to a normal vaccuum,I got this on Black Friday deals for 160$ I can’t imagine paying for price for this hunk of garbage. 1. The app doesn’t work. There is no stop function on cleaning cycles. You can click send home and then the roomba will decide I’ll go home once I finish…. The point is to stop now. You can choose cycle cleaning times but the roomba never adheres to them. I’ll chose 30 mins sometimes it’s 15 sometimes it’s 90 minutes. Does whatever it wants. 2. They constantly get stuck. I thought these things were supposed to be smart and map your home… that doesn’t happen. Frankly you can’t even use the auto clean schedule bc I’ve never once not had my zoomba forcibly ram itself until it’s stuck. 3. The bristles and cleaning pieces break easily 4. Doesn’t even clean well. At best it gets 30% of dusty and debri. I’m left vaccuuming after it every time. Maybe if you ran it every day but again that leads to having to be home to ensure it can finish the job. 5. The only thing it does sense is where you are and how to be a nuisance while it cleans. 6. It’s constantly out of power. It puts itself back on its charging dock but every time I go to have it clean it sat on the dock lost all its battery then has to charge again.

B0CNKX4429,1,Sending it back,"I was very hopeful that the Roomba would help get our pet hair under control. After an hour or so we are sending it back. The minor complaint - It is surprisingly noisy. Not vacuum cleaner noisy but noisy enough that you couldn’t run it while you were sleeping. Major problem - This thing gets stuck repeatedly and can’t figure out how to get itself unstuck. We have a spot in the corner of our dining room. It has a corner and about 3 feet from the corner there is a buffet table. The thing got between the wall and the buffet table legs and it just kept going back and forth. After 25 minutes I couldn’t stand it any more and moved it. All it needed to do was turn 90 degrees, but it couldn’t figure that out. So then it went into the fining room itself. Got under a chair and couldn’t get itself out. We have 6 chairs. This wasn’t going well. I see people recommending that you put chairs on top of the table, but if you have to pick up/move all your furniture, this thing is far more trouble than it’s worth. My summary is if you have an open floor plan and no furniture this thing may work. But in our house it was a disaster.","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024"

I have cleaned the metal charging posts, tried repositioning it a million times, and spent many hours on the phone with customer service. The customer service is beyond frustrating! They make me walk through all the same steps that I’ve done repeatedly and show them on video. And yet they still never resolve my problem and I end up having to get off the phone after an hour or two of such nonsense. Sometimes , after messing around with it, I can get it to charge fully, but that is a very rare occasion. I’ve only been able to use this thing five times in 7 months because it will never charge properly. Sometimes it looks like it’s charging and I leave it alone to charge but when I come back, the battery is dead.

After MANY hours, emails, and phone calls, they finally sent a replacement - and only because I lost my patience and explained they were violating the legal terms of their warranty. However, I just spent another hour on the phone with them - the replacement has the exact same Wifi connectivity issues. My Wifi is working perfectly, with no problems on any other devices but the vacuum constantly drops off the network, says it can't be found, needs to be re-booted, etc. After all these problems and hours wasted, I still do not have a vacuum that works properly. I asked iRobot for a refund, but they refused. I had a Eufy vacuum that worked perfectly for 6 years before finally dying.

It hasn't ran once without getting stuck (and more often than not, being 'stuck' is just the robot sitting in the middle of the room with nothing around it). I even shut doors to rooms so it only has the hallway or one simple room to clean, and it manages to screw up, run out of battery and never finish a job. On top of that, the blades on the bottom are BAD. After one semi-successful run (a miracle, honestly), I had to get scissors and CUT all the hair out of the bottom.

Now the new one I purchased a few months ago has absolutely no brains. It does not tell you when it is full. If it gets stuck and you get it unstuck within 5 minutes it will be stuck back in the same spot, and these two spots have been going on for several months. It is so determined to get stuck I will hear the wheels basically squealing trying to push itself into the spots. And now if you push the home button on either the machine or app it just runs around the house lost until it runs out of battery. I purchased my second because I was satisfied with the previous one.

They have “improved” the software and this version can’t navigate around my furniture and gets stuck in corners and alcoves. Forces its way where it doesn’t fit and the bin comes out. Forces its way onto my cat tree and then gets stuck. Doesn’t go under my desk. Doesn’t vacuum near the base. A big part of the problem is that it cleans up and down in straight rows.

I had been wanting a Roomba for a long time to help me keep up with the fur while I'm away. I regret making this purchase too quickly. I assumed that all robotic vacuums have mapping and some form of object avoidance at this point because they've been out for so long. I was wrong; this one has neither. It just randomly bangs around the apartment until it gets hung up on a chair leg or runs out of battery. I set it to run for approximately 45 minutes a day; with that setting, it runs anywhere between 7 minutes to 2 hours (if it doesn't get stuck on my furniture first.) And even when it runs for 2 hours it misses most of the floor. But the norm is that it gets stuck on a chair leg within 20 minutes the first day I'm on a trip and doesn't run again until I get home and rescue it. When I run it when I'm home, I've had to rescue it from my dining room and living room chairs 3-4 times a run. The suction is so poor that the pet fur and human hair just wraps around the brush and I have to clean it daily or it just smears it around the rest of the floor. Pros: gets under the couch and beds Cons: everything else. I spend more time rescuing it from being stuck and cleaning the brushes than I ever spent using my upright daily.

We don’t even have area rugs. The vacuum gets “lost” or stuck every single time it runs, even though I make sure to pick up any items off the floor.

Okaayyyy.....I moved it to somewhere else and it did ok for awhile until I found a piece of it laying in the middle of the floor. One of the battery sensors had come off and although I could snap it back into place it looked like a connection had severed internally. That was confirmed when it went to dock and made repeated attempts stick its landing. I manually placed it on the charger and bc the sensor is shot it will not charge at all. Returned and bought another knock off brand (Lebrant?) lightning deal for 100 bucks. I'm excited about the new brand because it includes edge only and random pattern which is actually my preferred method over back and forth.

B0CNKX4429,1,Frustrating Experience with the Roomba,"I had high hopes for my Roomba, but it has been a major disappointment. Right from the start, it consistently gets stuck on furniture and obstacles, which makes it more of a hassle than a help. Additionally, I’ve had trouble connecting it to the app. I followed all the instructions, but it rarely syncs properly, which defeats the purpose of having a smart vacuum. Without the app, I can’t schedule cleanings or control it remotely, leaving me feeling like I wasted my money. When it does manage to clean, it doesn’t do a thorough job, often missing spots and leaving debris behind. Overall, I’m quite frustrated with this purchase.

I wish I could return it, but we ordered it while renovating and didn't begin to use it for several months. Once we turned it on, it was a massive disappointment. Customer service is a joke. It took an hour to get ZERO answers.

We have a couple of pieces of furniture that sit just high enough for it to get under & just low enough for it to get stuck. So we were constantly getting it unstuck. It’s supposed to learn your house but instead every time it would come on it would make a beeline for the bedroom & right under the dresser to only get stuck again. We have a small home. You would think it would learn to avoid that area. Also it misses half the house half of the time. Then the app is hinkey. One would expect that if you set it to come on at a certain time it will start running at that time. Instead many days we’ve come home to find that it’s not ran at all. About the charge—some days it keeps a full charge. Some days it runs out of charge before vacuuming the whole house —we’ll find it sitting in the middle of the floor dead. Now it will not come on at all. There’s nothing stuck in it, we’ve cleaned out the filter, we’ve positioned it multiple ways on the charger & it will not come on. Completely dead. Thankfully I’m in my window to return it. I’m getting my money back & getting a Shark from Best Buy. I’ve never had a bad experience with Shark.

When I started using it I was unable to control it from going to spots where it gets stuck and I couldn't find a map on the app. I did some research and they said you need to run it about 5 times for it to create the map. I did that and nothing. I reset the unit and tried it again. nothing! I finally got to reach customer service and they told me that this unit does not support the map feature!! So that means I cannot have it clean a specific space on that floor nor I can prevent it from going to spots where it gets stuck! On top of that it is the dumbest smart device that I own, it can hardly find its way back home and most of the time it runs out of battery so I would have to find it and put it back on its charger. I would never purchase another iRobot again!","Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,1,Zero Stars don’t exist.,"This is my trashiest buy ever, all pun intended. Only had this thing for a month before it decided to give out and simply never charge again. It won’t recognize the charger and I did everything in the book to troubleshoot it. I came back here all these months later just to say that it’s garbage, and it made it ONE day after the eligible the last return date. All the hype these things had for years, and I finally caved LMAO what a joke.","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,1,Ineffective and noisy,"The Pros: It’s self propelled. The Cons: Garbage container is too small. Brush easily fills with dog hair. Does not even pick up leaves or little pieces of paper towels you put in its path. It picked up little onion skin from kitchen and dropped it off in the living room. I tell in the app to pause and it just ignores the command and keeps going. There is no return to base in app unless you can first get it to pause…You have to pick it up like a disobedient child that you are returning to their playpen. It struggles to return to base. Driving skills need work in this area. It pushes the base around which we have set against the wall, but it seems incompetent to return. It doesn’t really seem to want to fully vacuum any given room. Just randomly goes around house and sometimes criss-crosses carpet in the living room as it goes to the far reaches of the house. Maybe it’s true purpose is to map out the house for some dastardly plan to spy on us?? Who created this algorithm? Maybe if you live in a tiny, immaculate square apartment with no pet and you are never there, then this will help you feel like your place is clean.","Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,1,Waste of money,"Enjoy 30 seconds of watching the product doing nothing. I expected much more, and feel the technology to do an effective job is missing compared to other products in the market. I was expecting that it will do atleast 50% of the job (wasn’t expecting 100% cleanliness) but it rather bumps into things hard, will damage your products. Not at all recommended and I suggest to look for other similar products in the market. P.S.: I did try using this product in different areas of my house with same output.","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,1,"Inability to Start, Cannot Even Judge Cleaning Ability","Vacuum never properly started. After connecting it to Wi-Fi and updating to the latest firmware, the vacuum was essentially bricked and would not successfully leave the charging dock, perpetually being “stuck” with error 13 despite no uneven flooring and lots of light to illuminate the floor. Never successfully started vacuuming once after hours of troubleshooting, resets and reboots. Many online discussions in the past few weeks about other Roomba Essentials being bricked or failing to start in similar fashion, will never buy from this brand again & highly suggest you do your research to avoid the same mistake I made in purchasing this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2024"

Lo and behold because I don't live in the US , I live in the Latin American region I cannot download the app whatsoever so the machine is useless because I cant set it up.

Navigation is bad - it constantly gets stuck against furniture, falls off ledges, and generally just sucks at it. Mine now can't even navigate away from the base. It just moves a few inches and does half-crescent spins until it goes from 100% battery to zero. It can't even make it back onto the base. And there is no diagnostic process to tell you what's wrong.

B0CNKX4429,1,Can't connect to dsl wifi 5g,"I just bought this. And hoping it works. I put it on the charger and charged it over night and started the process of getting it connected to my phone. It didn't have the code to scan, so I had to manually install it, and in the process of manually installing it: its asking for my wifi password, so I put it in. Then it said failed to connect, and brought up a code. I put my wifi to 2.4 so it can connect and still the same error. I think i put in 30 minutes of trying to have it connect, and still I got no response. I thought to myself why am I wasting my time on trying to get this to connect to my dsl wifi, when all my other items had no trouble connecting to my 5g wifi. So I packed it up amd sent it back. So just to let you guys know just be aware if you have trouble connecting it to your wifi, send it back and get a new one. Why wast your time in connecting while your other ones connect successfully. Make sure before you purchase a new one that it can connects to a wide range of Wi-Fis other then just the lowest one and you have to change alot to make your others work again.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023"

B0CNKX4429,1,Not worth it.,"This is the biggest waste of money. It doesn’t map the house which should be a basic function of a robot vacuum. As a result it blindly roams the house. I have to constantly remove it from getting stuck under the same table. It doesn’t vacuum the whole house but it will vacuum the same area multiple times. Don’t let the description lie to you either, it does not clean in straight rows, if it bumps into something it will turn itself and go in another direction. Also if it bumps into something that is light enough it will push it out of the way.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

(It is advertised that you can operate this one without the app if desired.) It fully connected, showing the vacuum was fully charged, and currently VACUUMING!

B0CNKX4429,1,Misses large areas Doesn’t vacuum very well.,"It doesn’t vacuum everywhere. This vacuum is very annoying. It does not have a mapping feature and it just roams around randomly. When using it in my living room it wouldn’t vacuum the middle of the living room, it only vacuumed in front of the furniture. It also went to our entryway several times but not over to the dining area. And it bangs into closed doors a lot. So if it’s running when you’re trying to sleep with your bedroom door closed you’re going g to hear it hitting your door a lot. For me it’s not worth the money, so I returned it and bought a more expensive Shark AI that was half off for cyber Monday and it was totally worth it. This Roomba isn’t very good at vacuuming either. The Shark picked up so much more dirt and hair than this Roomba did. I guess I needed to experience how bad the Roomba 694 is to be able to feel comfortable spending $300 on the Shark and to appreciate how good it actually is. It’s also louder than I expected. It’s quieter than a regular vacuum but louder than the Shark AI.

I can manually put it on the charger or push the home button with the stupid device in front of the charger and it still won’t charge. I have wiped both contacts down and it should be making a good connection. It looks like the roomba is trying to run through the charger so obviously it knows where it is.

My house is immaculate and I can spot a pin drop of dirt on my tile and when this didn't pick it up I was disappointed, however when the vacuum started to turn on at 3 am when it was programmed for 10 am this was disturbing.

B0CNKX4429,1,Gets “stuck” constantly,"The whole point of a robot vacuum is that it is supposed to work on its own. This robot is way too needy and is incapable of completing a full cleaning cycle without stopping every 30 minutes or so because it is somehow “stuck”… usually on nothing at all. It will just stop in the center of a room and summon you to move it to a new location. It will stop at the edge of a normal rug (not a thick 70’s shag rug, a normal pretty flat rug) and alert you it is on a “cliff”. Here it is in a photo above just stopped at a door threshold for no apparent reason. This is every single time the thing runs- and it happens 2 or 3 times each run. At some point it’s easier to just vacuum yourself, so I am returning this. FWIW, I previously had a Shark Ion robot.

I’ve had better luck with knockoff vacuums that cost a third the price. I try to call product support and the number just says ‘not available, goodbye’. I don’t see any other options than contacting Amazon support within my warranty period, but don’t expect t help there either being beyond 30 days of purchase.

B0CNKX4429,1,Not Smart,"My apartment is 3 rooms: bedroom, kitchen, living room with a hallway connecting all three rooms. The issues: 1) it always gets stuck in one room and I end up having to move it from room to room. For some reason it tries to hug against the wall and each time it hits a corner it does a 180. 2) it barely returns home. I will set it in the hallway,( its home is in the last room where it has to take a right) it always heads towards the room, hits a wall and does a 180 and comes back. Not smart 3) its noisy 4) the app is clunky. For instance sometimes the return home option doesnt show up 5) it gets stuck on the most silly things. I have a plastic mat for my rolling desk chair. The mat is 1 inch off the ground. It will go up on the mat then get stuck on the mat and starts spinning in circles Pros: It does clean. And I do like the scheduling.

Considering my house has no pet, not kids, only 2 adults and wood floors, all over, if these machines cannot provide good performance here, they won't be able to do it anywhere else. Sadly, I was out traveling when I bought them and did not start using them until after the 30 days return period.

B0CNKX4429,1,Worst experience with a robot vacuum,"I've owned a robot vacuum from OKP Life and thought I'd transition to an official brand like the iRobot Roomba. This vacuum refused to cooperate right from the beginning. The app threw an error that my ""network subnet mask is too big"" and I had to adjust it from 255.255.252.0 to 255.255.255.0 . Even after that, I ran into an issue where the vacuum could communicate with the app on the LAN, but it could not reach the cloud. The app refuses to let you control the vacuum if it can't reach the cloud. The diagnostics are terrible, it simply said ""server unreachable"" without specifying what Web address it was trying to reach. It wasn't a firewall issue since I have over 2 dozen Google, Ring, and another robot vacuum IoTs that function just fine while using my Deco's UPNP firewall configuration. To put it simply, I'm taking good care of my OKP Life robot vacuum. I'm extremely disappointed in how iRobot is supposed to have more notoriety than the competition but it couldn't even do a simple thing like work with any subnet other than 255, or even reach out to its cloud server.","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2023"

B0CNKX4429,5,I feel like I'm Living in the Future,"The Roomba has been an interesting addition to my household. One thing that became immediately apparent is just how cluttered my floors are...it struggled to navigate during the first few days until I cleared up some obstacles. This device performs well on both carpet and tile, picking up dirt and whatnot effectively. It’s important to note, however, that it’s solely a vacuum. It doesn’t have wet/dry functionality or mopping capabilities, so it’s best suited for basic floor cleaning tasks. On carpets, it does a decent job overall, but I’ve noticed it isn’t particularly kind to areas where the carpet is already fraying. That said, I don’t think a traditional vacuum would do much better in that regard, so it’s not a unique downside of the Roomba. I was also concerned about how my dog might react to it, but luckily, the Roomba doesn’t seem to bother him at all. While it does its job, this vacuum’s effectiveness really depends on having a relatively clean and open space for it to operate. It’s not a replacement for more heavy-duty cleaning methods, but for day-to-day maintenance, it's absolutely fabulous.","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,5,Wonderful robot vacuum for daily cleaning,"I used this vacuum out-of-the-box and started using it right away. It cleans my house thoroughly by going to all the places and corners. It has that sweeping brush to clean the dust and other particles. It creates a map of the room and identifies the different areas to clean. For the 1st few days was trying to measure and gather the room information for its mapping. As the usage grows it is mapped correctly to identify the different obstacles in its path such as tables, chairs, couch and carpets. The motor on the vacuum is quite powerful with 4 levels of suction power. Initially it had trouble getting onto the carpet at the edge of the kitchen countertop. But after few times, was able to clean the hard-to-reach areas as well. Once done cleaning, it will self-empty into an enclosed bag that comes with the robot. I use the app to schedule cleaning sessions while I am away for work. It gives me a clean map report to show which room it cleaned. Vacuum is intelligent enough to know the level of battery and returns to its charging station to recharge. I noticed that it finished its battery in the middle of cleaning, recharged and then resumed the rest of the cleaning. I am quite impressed with the vacuum for its smart navigation and cleaning power. I scheduled it to run daily, and the house looks clean from all the debris. I highly recommend this vacuum for every household and one less thing to worry about in my daily chores. This is a 5-star product for its design and practical usage.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,5,Impressive little robot vac,"This iRobot Roomba Vac 2 is the first robot vacuum I have owned and I have to say I am really impressed at how well this robot vacuum actually works, it was super easy to get the robot setup and ready to go, just about everything is controlled via the app, the app allows you to choose the day and times you want the robot to work and you can also set customized areas where you want the robot to vacuum like the kitchen, living room ect., you can even give the robot vacuum a name, the app will also alert you if the robot gets stuck anywhere, the robot has 4 different suction levels to choose from, low, medium, high or maximum, I have mine set to the recommended medium suction, which they say is the best balance between cleaning and battery usage, the medium suction level actually works great at picking up the dog hair and smaller pieces of debris off both my tile floors and carpeted areas, the battery life is also really good on the medium level, so far the robot seems to be averaging right around 1hr and 30 mins or so, as far as the size of the area the robot will get vacuum in that amount of time, I have roughly a 2900sq foot house and the robot gets well over half of my house vacuum before the battery gets low, but a feature I really like is that when the battery gets to a low point or if the dust bin gets to full the robot will automatically return to the dock and empty the dust bin and recharge the battery, after the battery is recharged and or the dust bin has been empty the robot will automatically start again and finish vacuuming, I also like that the robot vacuums in nice neat straight lines, so when it cleans the carpeted areas of my house the carpet look nice, the robot will also vacuum underneath the coffee tables and furniture without getting stuck, that is as long as the area under the furniture is slightly higher than the robot, I was also surprised at how quiet the robot is, it does get a little louder when you use the high or maximum suction settings, another cool feature is that the robot will connect to your Google home or Alexa device, so you can just tell the device you use to start vacuuming or to dock the robot if you need to stop it from vacuuming, all in all I am very happy with the overall quality and performance of this iRobot Roomba Vac 2, I would definitely recommend this robot vacuum and in my opinion it's well worth the price.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,5,Much better functionality than older models,"I have tested quite a few iRobot vacuums over the years, and this one doesn't seem all too far off from many of their other products in terms of physical look. But the functionality and features on this thing rock! I mean, with each iteration, they get slightly better, especially since some of the older vacuums that I've used in the past needed frequent maintenance and manual emptying. So I do like how this one automatically empties the dust bin and minimizes the manual labor that I have to put into it. Also, this model is quieter than my older vacs. I mean, it's not completely silent, but I’m no longer hearing a roar while it runs and I've found that the battery lasts longer as well -- a little over an hour. And it's pretty cool that it can remembers where it left off after charging itself and goes back to that same location. The self-emptying feature works perfectly, but it's crazy loud while emptying itself, but totally worth it since I only need to swap out the bag once a month or so. Overall, I’m very impressed. It’s been working flawlessly, and while I still give the brushes and rollers a clean occasionally -- especially since my dogs and cats shed a ton! But all in all, it’s minimal effort compared to other models. So if you’re tired of dealing with older robot vacs that need constant attention, this one is a big step up.

Here’s what I love about it: * It empties itself into a bag that can hold up to 60 days’ worth of dirt and debris. * The smart mapping is way better than my previous vacuum. * The app makes control super easy. * It has solid cleaning performance and better suction than the TP-Link. It’s just as noisy as my previous unit, but I think most of these machines make some noise. We’re used to it, especially since it mostly runs at night in high-traffic areas.

No more lifting up furniture to vacuum, it fits under the couch and coffee table perfectly , since my back hurts sometimes the money is worth it to me!","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,5,What an easy way to vacumn,"So much fun to watch this robot clean up, and i can set it to clean while i do other chores.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,5,Works great!,"This is my first one. It was so easy to set up and use. I can’t believe I didn't have this already! I have this white tiled kitchen floor that drives me crazy! I feel like I never stop finding stuff on the floor. I did not think that there was anything to help me like these white floors, other than tearing them out. This has greatly helped with that issue. I now have something that will consistently and continuously pick up every little speck of dust that finds its way on that floor. I have had no issues with this working better than I expected.","Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,5,Works wonderfully on all floor types and won’t go over drop offs,"Technically, I would give this 4-1/2 out of 5 stars. I have four cats, and it does an amazing job considering all of the pet hair, dander, and scattered stray cat litter pieces. Honestly, it does almost as well as my Shark vacuum, which was specifically designed for pet hair. I have mostly tile and wood floors, but there are a few rugs scattered throughout the place. It moved seamlessly through the different floor types and has no trouble going over thresholds. As you can see in the video, it detects drop offs and avoids them. I have an 8” drop off between my living room and entryway and it easily avoided it. One thing I’m not crazy about, but I’m hoping it will do better at once it maps things out thoroughly and runs a few times, is dirt that is between a rug and a hard surface doesn’t always get cleaned as well as I’d like. However, considering I have cats, and I have to vacuum once or twice a day, it’s still worth not having to deal with it! I would highly recommend cleaning the rollers on the bottom regularly if you have pets. The roller can get pretty full of animal hair if they’re shedding much on your floor. I still think I’ll have to give it one thorough vacuuming a week, but I think this will work the rest of the time. After buying this model, I am kind of excited to try the Roomba model that both vacuums and mops in the future. I got this model for only $68 during prime day and it was an open box item that was brand new, so I can’t beat that value. (Brand new ones that hadn’t been shipped before we’re selling for almost $275!) Gotta love Prime day! Right out of the box this was very easy to set up. After charging for a few hours, it easily ran for 45 minutes and probably would’ve run longer if I hadn’t ended the vacuum sequence. Unfortunately, the model I had doesn’t have as good a smart mapping capability as I had hoped, so it took several passes through in some areas for it to find the edges of the surface that needed vacuuming. Since it’s already improving. I expect this to get better after it runs more. If anything changes, I will update my review.","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,5,Best one yet,"I have two German Shepherds…. Which equals a lot of fur… therefore we have four roombas. Yes FOUR. The roomba on the right is the first one I’ve ever owned. It was great. They don’t seem to make that one anymore and I wasn’t a fan of the second one that now lives in our basement…so I bought this one, the one on the left, recently to help keep up with the fur. This one does seem to get stuck under furniture more than the other two… however it gets over things better, runs quieter and vaccums both the carpet and hardwood just as well if not better. So…. I bought a second one haha. I highly recommend. I have all four scheduled to run every day, they work well with Alexa and I truly have no complaints. If I needed a fifth roomba I would 100% buy a third of this model, even if they still made the original one!","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

But once you clear the floor of any obstructions, this thing works great. When I was moving out of my old apartment, I let it run in the lower level for 35 minutes.

You have SO MUCH capability in the app to name rooms, tell the vacuum where you want to go and not go. I do recommend buying the self emptying base because it does tend to get full halfway through a job (the rubbish holder is rather small) and then it won't clean your whole house while you're at work.

B0CNKX4429,4,"Good Performance, But the Brush Broke Too Soon","I’ve been using my iRobot Roomba for about a year now, and while it’s been great for cleaning—especially for daily upkeep and pet hair—I'm a bit disappointed that the brush broke after just one year of use. It worked perfectly fine for the first several months, and the suction and navigation are still solid, but the side brush snapped off, and now it doesn’t clean as thoroughly in corners or along edges. Replacing the brush is an extra cost, and it’s frustrating that a key part of the vacuum wore out so quickly. That said, the Roomba still works well overall, and I love how it keeps my floors relatively clean without much effort from me. If you’re willing to replace the brushes occasionally, the Roomba is a great tool. Just keep in mind that some parts might not last as long as you’d expect, especially with regular use.","Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,Satisfied after a month,"Bought a new 694 elsewhere for less than $150, knew it was the basic model without mapping & auto cleaning. The downside is that it just randomly cleans, no rhyme or reason-just moves around aimlessly. Also, doesn’t seem to dock properly to recharge. Lastly, tried to use the app to send it back to the dock but doesn’t work. On the upside, on wooded floors & area rugs it picks up perfectly. Yea it bangs into chairs and stuff but who cares. We bought aftermarket wall barriers to section off different areas and the 694 works with them. We don’t mind doing different areas on different days. Even on a small house, seems it wouldn’t get the job done on 1 battery charge because of the haphazard way it cleans. Tried on berber carpet in basement and also worked well although the battery seemed to die quicker on that surface. We can’t believe how much dust etc it picks up (no dogs no kids). For $150 it was a great purchase. We bought the extended warranty just in case. I’d buy again at this price point, probably not at the $250+. It’s not perfect but it gets the job done.","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,Good overall quality,"We have had several Roombas & Eufys. However, we haven't had a Roomba for a while, so we were excited about this model. Pros: -Self-cleaning. I know it sounds silly, but constantly opening the vacuum and emptying out, is kind of annoying. -Has various power levels and it quite powerful -Various options to set on the phone and can be operated remotely -Has hardly gotten stuck on spots where our Eufy constantly got stuck on -Does a more patterned routine, so it appears to cover more thoroughly than the randomness of others -Can schedule for routine cleaning (we do ours at 3 am) Cons: -No mapping option (at least not one that I have seen so far after several days of use) -Might be too powerful--got ""stuck"" and ended up leaving some black marks on the carpet as it was trying to get out -Can be confusing to navigate all the options online, but after a while you get the hang of it -Does bump into things quite a lot; sometimes quite harshly -Rather expensive for not that much upgrade from older models Overall, not sure if the money is worth the few upgrades over my old model. It has worked well so far, but there are a few things I wish it did better.","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,Cool vacuum!,This is my first robot vacuum so I wasn’t sure what to expect. Overall I like it for in between vacuums but I don’t see it completely replacing me and my canister Kenmore. It did a great job not eating curtains or laundry half hanging out the basket. It didn’t fall down the stairs which truly surprised me. It was very cool watching it back itself up to dock. My son was super impressed with the suspension. It was fun watching it vacuum an embossed rug where it looked like an SUV going over rough terrain. 😂 I found it a little loud for its size but still way quieter than my full size canister vacuum.

B0CNKX4429,4,Good but lacking some features,"It's neat having a robot vacuum that cleans in lines and also has the self emptying canister. I appreciate this machine very much for that. The best we can tell with regard to mapping is that the backend is there, but it just doesn't have the feature to map your home and you tell it to ""clean the living room."" It's just going to take a map of your home while it's cleaning and then show you what it did. Also, the emptying function is pretty loud and might be a deal breaker if you're the kind that likes to run the vacuum at night. The run time also seems on par for what the claims are for this machine. Overall, it's good, but I don't feel like it's $399 good. It's barely $249 good. If you can catch this for around $200, I think that would be worth the investment. Otherwise, just keep looking.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

It doesn’t always climb onto the rug and clean it. I have to pick it up and put it on the rug for it to do the work.","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,4,Works well.,The manual printed with the Roomba would be nice. Not a fan of having to use an app just to see how to use it. I'm not young anymore so used to seeing things in print. Still haven't figured out how to change it from floor to carpet settings. But so far it's working well.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,Very Good All Around Home Robot Vacuum,"I’m lucky enough to own this new Roomba Vac along with our older trusted Shark Matrix so my review is based on that comparison as their price points were similar. This is a good vacuum. It has enough suction power to pick dirt up well. Our biggest problem is management of hair from our beautiful AussieDor. She literally loses a standard vacuum full of hair every day or two. So, any vacuum would be challenged. In comparison with my Shark, I think while this has good suction that the Shark Matrix actually picks up more. Perhaps that’s because it seems to return back to the base each time it gets near full to empty into the main base trash receptacle. The AI of this vacuum doesn’t seem to be as smart as our Shark because it often misses areas where there’s a copious amount of hair. Also, it doesn’t seem to have the sleekness to be able to fit underneath as many things as the Shark which is a big requirement for us. I think the AI of the Shark is probably more mature in that it seems to know where it needs to go better than the Roomba. There seems to be less logical decision making as to where it will navigate. I do like the battery life though as it seems like the Roomba can go for longer than the Shark can. For other important comparatives, I find that the Shark is a bit quieter than the Roomba and that I can find non-OEM parts pretty easily, such as replacement filters, internal dust bin/filter, rotating brushes, etc. I did not find the quantity of non-OEM parts available with the Roomba, but I did not do an exhaustive research on that point. The Roomba was definitely simple to set up; in fact I would say it is simpler than the Shark because the Shark requires full mapping of your home before it will do its cleaning. The Roomba functions well, but there are more robot vacuums available these days so things setting them apart have to be more special. I do think the AI mapping of the Shark puts it over feature-wise. Also, very important is that the emptying bin is smaller on the Roomba necessitating emptying the bin more often than the Shark. This is actually a big factor for me and my family because with our scheduled vacuuming of 3 days per week we don’t always empty the bin as often as we would wish. This isn’t such a big factor with the Shark due to its larger bin. All in all this is a good vacuum, it will do what you need and do it pretty well. Is it perfect? No. Is it state-of-the-art of the home robot vacuums these days? No. This is a very capable home robot vacuum and you’ll most probably really appreciate how much it helps manage pet hair, dirt, and dust. I’m now spoiled with this technology and just don’t know how I, or probably you, can manage without having a home robot vacuum on patrol.","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,4,Good as an introduction to the Roomba family.,"I live in an apartment with vinyl floors and was shocked at how quickly dirt, dust, and debris piled up. Sweeping felt like a full-time job. Enter the Roomba Essentials, my new cleaning buddy. It’s definitely not perfect, but it sure beats sweeping every. single. day. I picked up the Roomba Essentials as an introduction to the world of Roomba, fully intending to upgrade later. As long as you know this isn’t the most advanced Roomba, you’ll manage your expectations and won’t be too frustrated by the occasional hiccup. First off, its main job is to relieve you from daily vacuuming or sweeping duties, and it does just that. It connects to your smartphone, allowing you to start it, set a schedule, and send it home. It also gives you a handy map of where it’s been, so you can keep tabs on whether it missed a certain spot. It also comes with Google and Alexa functionality, so you can talk to your voice assistant and have it begin a job at your command. But it won’t learn your home’s layout like the pricier models. You’ll still need to do a little prep work by clearing the floors: cords, shoes, or anything it might mistake for a light snack need to be hidden. Trust me, it has a weird appetite for power cords and phone chargers. . . . It mostly manages to avoid big things like baseboards, doors, and anything low enough for it to sense directly in front of it. But when it comes to low hanging edges like the underside of the kitchen cabinets, or a piece of furniture with too low of clearance while still being strangely high enough to avoid its sensors? It’s more of a ‘bump and hope for the best’ kind of strategy. I’ve watched it play demolition derby with all sorts of different pieces of furniture or obstacles more times than I can count. But it's never aggressive enough to mark anything up or cause any damage. Despite the occasional confusion, it handles my 2-bedroom, 2-bath apartment pretty well, and the battery lasts plenty long enough to finish the job on the highest suction level, assuming it doesn’t get stuck in some bizarre nook and cranny... On the plus side, it’s quiet – much quieter than your standard upright vacuum. The only time it really raises its voice is to let you know it’s stuck or when it’s taken up that new hobby as a furniture boxer. iRobot makes maintenance super easy. There are guides and repair manuals in the app, which is great. But replacement parts aren’t exactly cheap. The app will also tell you when something needs replacing, so you’re not guessing when to switch out a part. If you’re expecting miracles, this little guy might fall a bit short. It’s the slightly more clumsy, budget-friendly cousin of the Roomba family. . .But if you’re looking for a reliable assistant to cut down on your daily sweeping and vacuuming, the Essentials does the job, quirks and all. Just be prepared for it to have a few ""learning moments"" along the way. . . .","Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,It’s not perfect and you must be patient,"I like it. I was very impressed. It does a good job picks up a lot of stuff that you wouldn’t be able to get with the normal vacuum does it by itself and when it’s done, it goes parks itself on the charging dock for the price I paid I have no complaints.","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,convenient for general cleaning,"Good for general cleaning. Does not clean corners or under sofas. I end up doing a bit more vacuuming with the regular vacuum with the skinny wand.

B0CNKX4429,4,I love my Roomba mostly..,"I bought this particular Roomba for a ranch in the country with hardwood floors and lots of tracked in dirt and of course dog fur from the fur baby. On hardwood it does exceptionally well, better than on carpets I would say, and I don't care what anybody says it definitely doesn't map the room it just bounces off walls randomly for a couple of hours until it gets pretty much everywhere, but the floor is always clean and the tray is always completely full after each cleaning. My only issue with this Roomba is it has yet to be able to get on the dock by itself at the end of cleaning and subsequently runs out of battery so when I return to the ranch it's usually sitting in the middle of the floor dead. I've watched it attempt to go to the docking station many times but it never can seem to get it right and well it's not a big deal to pick it up and put it on there it seems like some functionality that should actually work every time.","Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,Works well but won't connect to app,"This robot vacuum works well! If you're considering buying one, here's a brief pro/con list: Pro: -You can just turn it on and off it goes! It's really handy to be able to go about your day and just have the vacuum zooming around the home doing the chore for you. -Small! It's not super large or bulky so it can fit literally anywhere in the home. I currently have it sitting in my living room since it's not in the way of anything. -More quiet than a traditional vacuum! Compared to regular vacuums this one is fairly quiet and doesn't disturb the home environment as much, and also may not scare your pets (I have 2 cats who aren't phased by it whereas with other vacuums my cats were terrified of them). Con: -This particular model of iRobot doesn't connect to the app (at least mine didn't, so you may encounter this as well). You don't need the app, to be completely honest, but it IS helpful. -You HAVE to make sure ALL ITEMS are off the floor! As cool as this little robot is, it's not a genius. It can and will suck up anything that's on your floor, including cords, loose carpet fibers, etc. -It's not THAT smart! While it does a generally good job of vacuuming, it's not perfect. In my opinion, if you're wanting some general spot cleaning, this is perfect. However, if you're needing more specific cleaning (like a mess on the carpet), the traditional vacuum is the way to go. I WOULD NOT get rid of your traditional vacuum, just keep it handy for when you need it (like vacuuming the stairs or something). -The BIGGEST con in my opinion--the size of the dust bin. Obviously, it's much smaller than that of your traditional vacuum, so it needs to be emptied much more frequently. Depending on the amount of traffic in your home and if you have any pets, and also how often you vacuum, this could mean cleaning it out almost every single use. I hope this review helps anyone considering buying a robot vacuum!","Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,"Just ok, doesn’t run very long on a full charge or maybe my expectations were too high","The Roomba has its challenges. I’ll list them here: doesn’t get into all the corners you wish it would; it runs for about 30 minutes or less on a full charge so if you have a lot to clean up during a specific time of the day, you’ll be disappointed that have to keep charging it before you can continue, so it takes longer than I like for it to take. Also, pet hair and human hair will get stuck in the roller mechanism. If you don’t clean that out consistently, it will get stuck in the machine annd affect how well your Roomba continues to work.","Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2024"

Probably after I get more familiar with it I will like it better. The top got scratched on the cabinet door in the kitchen when I was trying to get it out from under it, and I hated that happened. I think it was a good value, and it has a year’s warranty. I regret getting the assurance protection plan.

B0CNKX4429,4,Great Roomba for 1 or two rooms.,"I really needed some help with vacuuming, especially a particular room that sees a lot of foot traffic. After doing some research I settled on this basic model of roomba. It cannot map the room like the higher priced models, so I need to close the door to keep it contained in the spaces I want it to clean. But clean it does. It handles a full sized dining room and a half sized kitchen in 45 minutes. The app is easy to use and generally helpful when you encounter problems. Meanwhile the roomba itself is easy to maintain and does a great job cleaning hard wood floors and area rugs. There are some issues however. This roomba is tenacious about cleaning dirt and will wedge itself under furniture trying to reach it. You'll have to roomba-proof your space. It also hits things - hard! It's pushed a small wine rack around and nearly knocked the bottles out! There is also a known issue with the roomba disconnecting from wifi, which can be restored by rebooting the router and/or the roomba. All in all a great basic robot vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,Does a good job,"This little vac does an overall good job. It will occasionally miss something, but overall I am satisfied with it.

It bounces around after it encounters obstacle so no exact cleaning pattern, but it will eventually clean the area. You can move it to a specific dirty area and do spot cleaning, and that's a nice feature. I especially like the fact that it can clean under my bed and cabinets which my upright vacuum cannot do. I am very happy with it and hope it will last a long time.

B0CNKX4429,4,Time-saving,"I've always wanted a roomba, so I took the opportunity and got this one. After opening up I saw that it has a pretty basic presentation. I thought it would be more elegant as far as design. There's three buttons that you can use to operate it along with the app, Which makes running a very simple. One thing that could definitely be improved though is it being able to better decide what direction to go to do cleanup. It seems it picks some favorite areas and then it'll keep going over those areas over and over in even if you pick up and pull the roomba to the area you want cleaned up.

It comes packaged with 2 small foam pieces sticking out of the side. At first I thought these were to brush/ protect baseboards but I believe they are just packing material that was blocking the bumper that tells the bot when its running into something. After removing those, it does work much better (and stopped wedging itself under my recliner and then yelling for rescue) but it does still get stuck going over the same area over and over once in a while.

B0CNKX4429,4,Good if you have pets,"PROS: 1) suction is fairly impressive for this small machine. Picks up hair, dust, crumbs, scrap pieces of thread and material (I sew and quilt). 2) Pretty quiet, a LOT less noisy than a regular vacuum. There's a constant buzz that one can get used to fairly easily. Can still easily hear the radio or TV at normal volume levels. 3) Didn't scare the dogs too much b/c it wasn't too noisy, although they were very curious and followed it around for the first few times I had it running. 4) Easy set up and use: Plug it in, charge it up (give it at least a couple hours to charge completely), press the button and let it go. 5) Doesn't snag on small floor mats/carpets. Puppy pads I lay out does get crunched up a bit, but at least it doesn't stop the Rumba and cause me to redirec it. Rumba figures out it's not something to be sucked up and turns around to continue on. 6) Pretty easy to clean (i.e. removing the parts and getting out the hairs and debris took about 1-2 minutes (I like to clean all the hairs from the bristle brush and rubber brush on the bottom of the machine) Dog fur will get caught in the moving parts so cleaning it all out I think would prolong the life of your Rumba. CONS: 1) Should clean it out every time it's used. Depending on how large your home is that the Rumba has to cover and how much it has to suck up, the bin gets full pretty quickly. 2) Rumba doesn't seem to stop. I had it running for over 2 hours, but it never decided it was done and returned on its own to it's docking station. I had to physically pick it up and return it to the docking station. I feel this was a good purchase for me (someone with dogs who wants a tidy home). Saves me a lot of time from sweeping & vacuuming.","Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024"

My no name was cheaper and also has two side brushes that work together and observing the two leads me to believe iRobot has created way too many models with tiny differences and different compatible parts and in doing so harmed the brand.","Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,4,Cleans well when it manages to get there,"Good: Cleans well where it manages to go. I have a high shed dog and used to have socks caked with dog hair while still vacuuming twice a day. Got this and my home is noticeably less gross. But, for the cost it isn't really a good value due to its navigation. Bad: No pattern control and poor user guide / minimal function to the app. I hate the random cleaning method this does and wish it had a normal back and forth feature so that it would get everywhere. It definitely doesn't and somehow manages to run the same 'random' route every day... So there are some high traffic spots right near it's dock that it just about always missed. Annoying: It can't figure out how to re-dock itself even within clear view and close to its docking station. It also has a pretty tiny dust bin that fills up daily for me (and never empties all the way. I have to get my other vacuum to clean off the clump of dog hair that gets stuck to the filter every day.)","Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,4,Godsend for Pethair,"After moving into a home with no carpet and hardwood/tile, I learned how badly cat hair accumulated on the floors, especially with multiple cats. (Seriously, it's atrocious.) I was a bit iffy with the reviews, but I decided to give this model a go as a cheaper option to try. So far it has worked great at keeping the pet hair under control. It doesn't do any kind of mapping, so can be a bit repetitive or random in how it gets the job done, sometimes skipping over a spot several times in a row, but even with that flaw, it really does a good job keeping pet hair at sane levels and that's really all I need. I went from having to sweep 1-2 a day down to a quick vacuum before mopping each week, so it's been a huge time saver. I do have to empty the bin every 2-3 sessions and give the brushes a quick clean (mostly because of my own long hair, not really a pet hair issue), but it takes just a few minutes so it's not very much maintenance so far. Overall, if you're not looking for something high end and just need some day to day help with pet hair and dust, it works really well and I would recommend it if you catch it on sale.","Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024"

It’s easy to open to empty and clean and sits in its charging port quietly until re-activated. My only complaint is that it doesn’t seem to complete a room in a grid. The robot seemingly roams at random and will cover the same spaces over and over again without moving to another area. I have to give it a little push to start a new room section. In the hallway, it turns around and comes back with only half the hallway completed. Go figure. Since this robot was one I could afford, I’m happy to have it.

This roomba can pickup surface debris sitting on top of the carpet just fine, but anything into the fibers of the carpet it struggles with. This is more or less a hardwood floor vacuum, the auto empty base works like the others and I've got no issues with that. The base seems to have a weak charger as it takes the roomba around 6-8 hours to fully charge. The bumper is already pretty banged up due to it charging into everything like a bull... Even when its hit something and it knows there's an object there, it will keep hitting it over and over in slight degree changes. It also does not like pet bowls or pedestal fans, it declares them its mortal enemy and they must be destroyed! I've watched this thing try to go around my fans base and go up and down over and over as if its in a trance...

The Roomba does a decent job cleaning, especially if you take the time to clean out the brushes and filter on a regular basis. It will get stuck on things at times - we've had to 'robot' proof the house a little bit as we've figured out where it gets caught. We NEVER use the app and don't have it set on a timed schedule, we just push the clean button and let it do it's work. The EUFY had a remote control, which I really liked. The Roomba has a higher profile than our EUFY did, so it doesn't get under the TV cabinet or other things like we were used to. The filters on the Roomba have plastic around them, where our EUFY had a paper/fabric filter along with a 'spongy' one, but no plastic. The Roomba only has 1 rotating sweeper on the front, where the EUFY had 2. The only real problem we've had with the Roomba is - it stopped recognizing it's base about a year ago.

Generally, it does a good job at covering the whole room, but it often just kicks the litter around without actually removing it sort of defeating the purpose. It takes me 5-10 mins each day to do a better job, sometimes making me regret the amount I spent for this thing. However, when life gets truly hectic (as it sometimes does for me), I do appreciate having it; something is better than nothing when it comes to the amount of litter sticking to my feet.

However, it's just frustrating to run. It constantly gets stuck under my couch, in part because it will bump into the couch, and instead of turning the opposite way, it'll just do a whole 360 and bump into the couch AGAIN. Rather than make small adjustments when it bumps into furniture, it almost always does a 360 and bumps into the same thing, and this happens over and over until I have to pick it up and set it somewhere else. Because of this, it almost never picks up fur underneath cabinets in my kitchen. Yet when it goes over any of my rugs (which are thin, non-carpet rugs) it SUDDENLY remembers how to make a 180 turn and go somewhere else, leaving the fur on my rugs. I have a double-coated Great Pyrenees and it's summer so he sheds A LOT. To keep up with it, I'd have to vacuum basically every other day. So I thought this would make my life a bit easier, but it's just so frustraingly stupid that it's more of a nuisance than anything.

It did miss some trash on the floor but I think it's still in its learning phase and after a while it will have the floor pan down. For now, I've just run it twice and it gets everything. I used the maximum suction setting and it does drain the power quickly. Love that I can set a schedule for weekly cleaning and also clean on demand via the app or manually. Good machine, average cleaning.","Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,3,Works best on carpet,I purchased this Roomba to help keep the floor clean with a dog running around the house. It keeps my carpet clean and does a decent job on area rugs. The hardwood floors are another story. It leaves so much behind I usually have to sweep after. The mapping could use some improvement. It tends to spin in circles and go over the same spaces. It also doesn’t sense cords and can get tangled. Pretty good for the price but I would upgrade the model if you have mostly hardwoods.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2024"

So apparently, the Limited Warranty is not only limited in time frame but also the type of parts that are covered? Why is the brush is considered an accessory when it is one of the crucial parts of the cleaning process? When I bought the Roomba, the brush has already included/attached as the standard part, no extra cost to buy it - so this is just a shady policy. Also, considering it is not even a year since I got it, the quality of the product is subpar.","Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2024"

I would really recommend you avoid this vacuum, unless you live in a tiny studio apartment with very little space. Otherwise, you'll be spending all of that money on a vacuum that can only reliably clean one room and only if that room isn't too big. Our vacuum got stuck immediately over a cable and though past vacuums we've owned have managed to maneuver their way out of a situation like this, our vacuum managed to maneuver its way into that situation every chance it got.","Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,3,"Good entry level Roomba, with classic iRobot flaws","iRobot is kind of the household name in robotic vacuuming these days, and this one here is just another standard entry into that. It lacks the features of some of the better models (such as automatic disposal of the debris tray and room mapping) while still delivering on the basic premise of routine cleaning. At the end of the day, this model is just for floors of your house that don't have a lot of traffic or if you're on a budget and don't want to research other brands. It's got some pretty bad limitations - the round shape making it useless for edging and corners, for one obvious example - and only marginal improvements over its bump-turn-bump-turn predecessors on the upside. We put it in our basement, where almost nobody goes, because that's all it needs, but would never consider using it on the main floors of our house.","Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024"

It has taken it back a few years with no auto empty container. I have noticed that the vacuum can go over particles multiple times before actually sucking them up. I would say the operation is oddly average for a brand name iRobot Roomba. I have owned quite a few and this one doesn’t even seem as good as my original ones in performance. I suppose the price is supposed to feel like a bargain but if you don’t have a well working machine then the price doesn’t matter much.

B0CNKX4429,3,Angled Rows While Cleaning?,"I was really excited to get this iRobot Roomba robot vacuum cleaner, having had a robot cleaner in the past. I'm a bit disappointed in this one as it doesn't follow straight rows while mapping rooms. It almost seems haphazard in the way it maps a room. It ran out of battery before completing the first cleaning cycle as well and didn't go back to its home base. I did get a notification that the battery was low and wound up having to look for the cleaner in order to place it back on its base. My last robot vacuum had a well laid out mapping system and the app showed where the cleaner had been with color coding of each room - it was easy to tell where the vacuum had cleaned. This one has a map of the cleaning area, but it's hard to tell which rooms the map is showing. No color coding. Unfortunately, this iRobot Roomba doesn't live up to the brand.","Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,3,Unreliable with Phone App,"I've had the Rhoomba 694 for just under six months. Overall, I am satisfied with the cleaning jobs when I can get the thing to work, but have found the App for controlling the vacuum to be unreliable. I can't remember how many times I have had to re-install the device, then have to do it all over again. The product health information is no longer available (after the first install, it was) and the notification sounds no longer work as well. I also paired with my Alexa device, and there too, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, even when the control says it is connected to my wifi network. I contacted customer support and after 29 minutes with a technician I could barely understand tried all the suggestions to no avail. I was told to call back if the suggestions did not fix the problem - they didn't. Rather than going to the useless technical support again, I will just give up on using the App and put the Rhoomba in the room I want to clean, press the start button, and let it do it's thing. I give the Rhoomba a B- on the cleaning it does, but an F on reliability with using the App.","Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,3,Bare bones but not bad,"As far as quality goes, it seems well made, but this is pretty basic for the features and is probably over-priced in today's market. Mainly paying for the IRobot name. Not that there is anything wrong with that. It does the job it's supposed to. The good: It really helps to keep excess dirt off the floor. I was really surprised by how effective it is in keeping excess dirt off the floor and the biggest help for me, is the dog hair it picks up. I have a German Shedder and this vacuum does a great job of keeping the hair under control. Even when I would say the floor is clean, this thing always finds something. It somehow, even without mapping features seems to cover the whole floor. Emptying is simple and taking the rollers out to clean them is not rocket science either. Battery life has been great. It usally runs for an hour and a half each time it cleans. The bad: Not the smartest kid on the block. I usually have to pick it up at least once while it is cleaning. It can just barely fit under parts of my couch and will get stuck there sometimes. I could probably stop this by blocking those parts of the couch where it gets stuck, but I think it should be able to navigate them better. It is a bit noisy. Most of the noise comes as it bumps into things while going on its merry way. I really think that at this price it should have mapping features. It seems to cover everything, but in the most random way you can imagine. Maybe it's just me, but I find it annoying and would much rather it have a more logical pattern. Overall, I would say it does a good job, but could be a lot more refined in how it does it.","Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2024"

Half the time the base cannot detect it so then it just keeps beeping at you, you go and adjust it but it still won't detect it. It seems to only charge if it does not die all the way and can find its way home. If it dies somewhere and then you place it on the charger, you are likely going to battle getting it charged for days.

I don't write a lot of reviews but this is an exception. If you read the product description, you should know that it's terrible with pet hair and that it is unreliable in ways that are unrelated to pet hair.

Another day I used it only in one bedroom, closing it off from the rest of the house. I never saw a “map”. Therefore, if I use Alexa to say clean the bedroom, it doesn’t, it leaves the dock and randomly cleans the living room. Battery doesn’t last that long.

Unfortunately in the 2-3 weeks I've owned this Roomba, I've found out that its not necessarily better than the much cheaper Greenworks robot I havce and in fact worse in a few key area: 1) NAVIGATION There is no measurabble improvement in the navigation of the Roomba , while it does vaccum in neat straight lines , it does a very poor job of obstacle avoidance ...in a wide open game room/garage with hardly any furniture .. it does still manage to get stuck in curtains very frequently and worse of all it will go bang in at full speed into walls and the very thick legs of my pool table . As a result, it has managed to scratch its front IR sensor panel badly which in turn affects it retrun to dock and auto empty fucntionality . 2) CLEANING ABILITY This area was one place I was fully expecting the Roomba to do better, but again to my surprise , It actually did worse than my basic Greenworks robot. I checked the dust bag after 3 weeks of use and It wes almost empty and as good as new .. basicallly it means that it is not picking as much dust at all .. And as a quick pointer , my old robot used to get its bin full after 4-5 days of use .. this Roomba bin is pretty much empty after 3 weeks of use ! Very poor performance indeed 3) NOISE On its medium setting , the Roomba appears to be louder than my old basic robot . I would not want this to be running inside my house or bedroom because of it 4) AUTO EMPTY As mentioned earlier because it bangs into walls and furniture legs at full speed which scratches is IR sensor panel, the robot will sometimes fail to align or make contact with the auto empty bin fully which means it is not able to auto empty without your intervention . So in additon to it getting stuck on stuff , you also have to babysit it quite often FINAL THOUGHTS So thats it , i was expecting this Roomba to knock it out of the park over my basic Robot vaccum , but in the end its a bit more hassle with a lot of quirks like poor obstacle avoidance and the most importantly it does poorly in its main job of cleaning . Hence I am giving it 2 stars and would not recommend it .","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,2,Buggy software = poltergeist Roomba,"This thing does a great job cleaning. It’s too bad the software is buggy and it starts by itself instead of according to the schedule. I have reset, redownloaded, deleted schedules then re-added them. Nothing works, so this vacuum has a mind of its own. One day I set it on the kitchen island after cleaning it out. I left the house for a hour and this thing decided to get to work pushing glasses, plates, fruit, etc off the counter. It did manage to stay on the counter itself, so the cliff detection definitely works!","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,2,Not a great Roomba .. buy a higher priced one!,"I fell for the low price and regret it. I have owned Roombas for more than a decade and my current one is starting to lose battery power. I decided to get the low priced one as a backup. I should have just popped for a new higher priced model. This thing has about 50% of the qualities of the others.. It has one brush roller while my old one has two. Everything about it is cheap, lightweight and seems fragile. It requires two full cycles to actually pick up debris and to cover the whole room. It failed to get small crumbs in the indentation of tile grout in the kitchen. Just went right over them. When I go over an area of the floor with a wet paper towel after the Roomba has gone over it, there are still small bits of dirt and dust. I missed the return window by 2 days or otherwise I would have sent it back and bought a more expensive one. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR is absolutely true.

B0CNKX4429,2,Disappointing performance on hardwood floors in a pet free house.,"I've owned this Roomba for over a month now, previously I had a different brand (cheaper brand robot vacuum which I had to sell due to move), I bought this thinking it'd be an upgrade but that was a mistake. We have hard wood floors with 2 low pile and 1 medium pile rug, 2 kids, no pets. Set up: I bought it new and but had to perform a factory reset on it straight from the box to actually get it to work. Performance: This vacuum does a crappy job. It misses spots ALL the time, it's navigation of a room is NOT SYSTEMATIC, it hits the wall, then goes off in a different direction seemingly never to return. It doesn't have a volume control on the app, it's error messages are super obnoxious and loud, It woke me at 2am one night with 'LOW BATTERY PLEASE CHARGE' because it didn't dock properly. See video for lack of suction. I just cleaned the filter and emptied the tank before taking the video so you be the judge. Disappointing performance and purchase, do not recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,2,Gets stuck a lot,"The price is decent compared to other robot vacuums, but I'm beginning to realize it's more trouble than it's worth. I find it gets stuck a lot (for example, it will vacuum the same spot over and over again because it can't figure out which direction to go in) and if i pick it up to move it to another part of the house, I get an error message and have to send it home (which it can rarely get to on its own). Also there's no functionality to control its movement via a remote or phone, which even cheaper beans have.

That is the first question you are asked in the setup. The QR code couldn't be recognized when I scanned it. So I had to do manual set up. It can't use 5G WiFi so had to set WiFi connection to old 2.5G connection. Once I got through what setup I could get through, it was scanning to find the unit and it couldn't find the unit so set up wasn't completed. It was over 2 hours of pure frustration. That was after attempting to set it up myself for an hour. AT one point I hit a button during the setup and it took off on it's own and it did one swipe of an area rug and it did pick up quite well.

B0CNKX4429,2,Very Surprised and Disappointed,"I have an off-brand robot vacuum that I picked up a while ago. So when the iRobot vacuum showed as an option, I was excited because I figured it would have all the features that my little off-brand has and then some. I mean, iRobot basically started this genre of vacuums, right? The only thing that this system does that seems solid to me is the auto disposal via the autoempty dock. I mean, c'mon iRobot. Starting with the vacuum, I was expecting the sensors to do a much better job of obstacle detection and avoidance. This vacuum smacked into so many walls and table legs and other objects, it made no sense. And yes, I understand that certain things the robot would likely miss a bit, like table legs or open space around posts, etc., but a complete wall?! How do you just slam right into the wall? If it wasn't smacking itself around to figure out where to go, it was getting stuck against items that it was trying to drive through as opposed to navigating around them. And getting stuck resulted in battery drainage. If it ""didn't"" get stuck, it still would need to return to the charger in order to complete the floor. And no, I had everything picked up and out the way to make the mapping and cleaning process easier. Comparatively, my cheaper off-brand vacuum navigates around everything easily...no banging, no attempting to force itself over items it shouldn't. It just goes around and finds its way in if one exists. Now on to the app. Yes, the app does allow for scheduling, you can trigger the Roomba from it, set favorite scheduling times and see a history of your cleaning. And it does show a ""scan"" of the area the vacuum covered. Compared to my off-brand however, the capability and app needs some help. The off-brand not only shows you what it scans as it tracks around its initial clean, it's smart enough to break the rooms up that it goes through. And once it completes the cleaning (which it can do on one battery charge), I'm able to select the various ""rooms"" and label them so I can specify which room to clean if I don't want to cover the entire floor. In addition to this feature, I can also watch from the app what area/path the vacuum is currently in while it's cleaning. Roomba, why are you not doing this?! In a nutshell, you can do a lot better than this vacuum for half the price.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"
B0CNKX4429,2,Meh,"Like other reviewers said, it vacuums with no rhyme or reason and seems to get confused a lot. Didn’t realize it was labeled as “essentials” so the lack of oomph makes sense now. Unfortunately, it’s getting returned.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,2,Not worth the money,"I had high hopes for this vacuum and I probably should've done more reading of reviews before making the purchase. I bought it for $350 and the only difference between this model and the ones below it are the self-emptying feature. Honestly, this Roomba is not much different from the one I had 10 years ago. I would recommend spending a little more or just vacuuming with a traditional vacuum. Pros: -The self-emptying feature is great as I don't have to empty it repeatedly. Cons: -The battery will not last a cleaning of 600+ sq feet. Basically, it couldn't clean my entire first floor. -No Smart mapping capabilities. I can't tell it to target a specific area that I feel needs more attention. -No ability to have it self-empty on demand. So if the battery dies, it will not empty until it's charged and cleans again. -Cannot accurately detect objects to avoid bumping into them. It constantly bumps into everything. In 2024 and at a price point of $400 you would think it would be able to navigate better. -Will take paint off your furniture. Neutral: -Wifi enabled is an expected feature in 2024 so this is no real benefit.","Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,2,Broke within a year,"I didn't have an issue with the fact that it's pretty quirky. As many reviews have stated, it vacuums very randomly, tends to get stuck alot, and after a very short time, seemed to have lost it's ability to find it's charging station. I cleaned it after each use, moved it from room to room as needed for cleaning & would reattach it to the charging station myself. I learned quickly where it would get stuck and how to avoid that. It was all worth it to me because I would just let it do it's thing as I got other housework done. Just let it bounce around long enough & it will usually get the whole room. I would then move it to another room & block it in there until it was done, ect. Within 6 months though, I was struggling to find a good spot on the charger. I cleaned everything well, kept moving it around on the charging port to get it to charge (spending so much time trying to get that right got old) Eventually, I'd also have to put some sort of object on top of it to get it to press into the charging station. The flimsy brush broke off within 8 months making it pretty useless at grabbing dust off the floor. I didn't feel like it was worth paying for a replacement part when the whole vacuum was clearly not going to last much longer. Finally one day when I took 30 mins just trying to get it in the right position, with the right item on top to get it to charge & then pulled out my trusty 10 year old corded vacuum to go back over almost everything the Roomba had covered..I realized it was time to call it a day. In fact, after that I went in to see it had given up charging. Again.

B0CNKX4429,2,Good for single room only`,"Too basic, too simply, frequently gets lost or stuck in locations that I really feel it shouldn't get stuck in. For instance, it gets stuck under the legs of my rolling chair because when it seems to realize it gets stuck it refuses to do anything except make 180+ degree rotations, which result in it continually aiming into the chair. If it did smaller rotations or simply backed up, it would get out of there no problem. It cleans real good, but its also a nuisance to clean the rollers and brush. The app is horrible. Legitimately embarrassing for such a major product manufacturer. Needless restrictions on setting schedules, no map, looks like crap. The robot does not have any sort of system or method of cleaning a room in an logical manner, it just bounces around the room at seemingly random angles until the battery runs low and it struggles to return home. What it is good at is cleaning a small area, like a single master bedroom. The actual cleaning action is good, it picks up a tremendous amount of dirt and my rooms carpet has never looked cleaner.

B0CNKX4429,2,Not worth it,"I bought this product to help with the chaos of cleaning when you have multiple pets but this just adds to it rather than help. Its sensors are not accurate.

If it gets caught under a chair or in the corner of a room it's unable to figure out how to get out, So i have to pick it up and move it. It has a home button that you push on your phone when you are reading for it to shut off and return to base. Nope. I push the home button multiple times and it just keeps cleaning.

I have one room I needed it to work on. It constantly bumped into things and just kept bumping into them until I turned it around. Sometimes it would go a different direction, but usually it just went back to the same spot and got stuck again. It's never been able to find it's way back home, even when I placed it just a few inches from it. It's currently laying upside down on the floor because it won't shut off.

I picked up everything I thought it could get caught on pre-vacuuming. It would randomly skip sections of floor. It would leave pet hair behind. It could not find home base unless it was within 5 feet of it. The little plastic arm randomly popped off, and I would spend 20 minutes looking for it. It would hit dining room chairs hard enough to move them. This was the third Roomba I'd owned.

B0CNKX4429,2,"Defeated by dog hair, cheap components","I’ve had my roomba since 11/23. I use it 2-3x per mo on a hard surface floor approx 700 sq ft. It picks up grit and dirt pretty well. Dog hair not so much. The pictures show how dog hair piles up within the gaps between the brushes, as well as on the little wheel. It takes more time for me to clean the roomba than it would take to vacuum the floor myself, as you have to completely disassemble the whole pickup mechanism to clean it properly. The little yellow brush used to have three legs. Now it has two, and I have no idea how it broke. If you have normal dirt on the floor, this roomba is ok. If you have a fuzzy dog, you’ll spend a lot of time cleaning the internal mechanism - not worth it. If I’d known it had this type of absolutely useless pickup function, which I’ve dealt with on other types of vacuums, I never would have bought it.","Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024"

It collects a lot of dust and pet hair every cycle, but it's by no means a good robot vacuum. I basically have to babysit it as it works. Out of the 10 cycles I've tested it on, it has only successfully returned to its dock only one of the times. Regardless of repositioning the home station, restarting it, removing objects from it's path, reconnecting it to the wifi, etc., it will just wander around as if it's lost, so if I leave it alone, it will be dead in a random part of the house a majority of the time.

I was worried about the suction/ability to pick things up. Which, it does do a good job with picking things up. What I personally would not be able to stand is that this will not go around some obstacles. It moved my roller kitchen chairs around and moved my garage can from its spot. I do not want to come home and have to rearrange my kitchen but putting everything back to where it's supposed to be. Also, after the vacuum was finished and going back to the charging spot, it took almost as much time to go back to the charger than it did to vacuum everything.

Additionally, I mainly got this roomba for a daily clean up of cat-related debris and it mostly just spun litter around and vacuumed up about 40% of what it encountered. I have had this model for 2 years and a few weeks and it went from working fine to dying mid-job, reporting error 6, and refusing to restart. So while it was nice to have and certainly gave some peace of mind that under my bed and shelves were being somewhat vacuumed regularly, I would not suggest this model.","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024"

B0CNKX4429,2,Meh,"I really wanted a Roomba, so I purchased this one, but wasn't all that impressed. It cleans well, when it's not getting stuck under something or vacuuming the same spots over and over and over. This one has no house mapping, so I would often find it vacuuming the same room or same spot repeatedly and have to manually move it. It wasn't hard to set up, and works well with my echo, but if I'm busy and just want to let it go to vacuum the house, i can't rely on it getting every room. After a few years it's kind of become a pain to charge. I make sure the contacts are cleaned and lined up and it with act like it is charging, but will stop after a few minutes. One day when I thought the battery was dead it turned itself on and started vacuuming my bedroom then died underneath the bed. I suppose it was a nice ""intro"" to Roomba at this price point, but I wish it performed a little bit better overall in terms of not hitting the same spots repeatedly or trying to go under areas it can't clear. There's also no way for it to detect the items it is vacuuming so I've found it trying to suck up socks and phone cables that got in its path - that's not entirely the roombas fault though. Overall, if you're between this model or a more expensive model that offers the house mapping and room selection, go for the higher end model because this one will just frustrate you.","Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2024"

My husband has an Android, I have an iPhone, and we have a great router that has both 2.4 / 5 G options, and we tried everything - messing with Wifi/ router settings, hotspotting our phones, reinstalling/rebooting, spending a couple hours on the internet and then with tech support.

It does not map out a room by going back and forth evenly and even sometimes keeps going over and over the same spot, back and forth. It will go over thresholds in doorways, but tends to get stuck on kitchen mats that are not any higher than a doorway threshold. It goes under my couch and chairs but gets stuck under them like it cannot see in the dark? I have to reach under my couch to pull it out. It does a good job of picking up dog hair and floor debris and I am surprised that it can pickup quite a large amount before emptying the small debris box. It does return to it's home for charging all by itself. The app works nicely and is accurate. But again, it gets stuck a lot, won't go over kitchen mats and the worst thing is there is no rhyme or reason to it's mapping pattern.

To start, this is not directly compatible with Alexa. You have to set up and configure the device through the iRobot app, and then you can link the iRobot account with Alexa. When it behaves, this robot does clean very well. It gets up all the dust bunnies and fur and whatever else needs to be vacuumed off our floors (we have hardwood in the common areas and carpet in the bedrooms). However, it gets stuck constantly. It'll get stuck under the TV stand - even though it fits easily under and could come out with no issues; it gets stuck under the bar cart - which it really has to work at getting under; it gets stuck under the sideboard - again, it has more than enough room to move about; in short, it seems to get stuck whenever it wants too. This makes using the thing a mixed blessing. It constantly has to be watched to get it ""unstuck"".

B0CNKX4429,2,Disappointing performance - get's stuck in middle of empty floor,"I was excited to try this out this robot vacuum thinking that the brand name would mean great quality. I have been using a Shark Ion Robot vacuum for several years and it has its own problems but this one is definitely a downgrade while I though it would be a big step up. After testing it in a basement that has no obstacles, it was a major disappointment to come down and see this vacuum be ""stuck"" in the middle of nowhere. The floor has all carpet and walls which should have been an easy task to vacuum some random spots and come back to the charging dock. It was very painful watching this vac in action because it literally kept pushing itself into the wall against the baseboard and then stop with a flashing red light stating that it is stuck. Comparing this against my older Shark, this bot had no battery percentage indicator on the hardware, it didn't come with any stop zone strips, and it didn't have a physical on/off switch. The built-in speakers are loud and low quality. There is only one brush with 3 sides and the HEPA filter is much smaller. I did like that it is fairly quiet during operation, it had a brush with blade accessory attached to the dust basket part and the charger had a Velcro strap to tidy up the cables. Aside from those, the negatives outweighed the positives. There was no way to send the bot back home from the app and there was no good explanation as to what happened to the bot from the app that made it stop working. I did not see a performance power cleaning option either. Unfortunately, this bot doesn't seem to have smart sensor or AI capabilities as it keeps going into the same wall over and over. Instead of backing out and cleaning a different path, it keeps hitting the same spot until it gets stuck in a wide open level surface. After weeks of testing, I always came back to the bot sitting in the middle of the carpet instead of the charging dock while my older Shark that I do not like very much has been in the charging dock. Even though this is priced as an entry level robot vac, it is not worth the hassle to constantly babysit this thing. I am very disappointed by the intelligence of this thing. When it cleans, it does collect good amount of dust as I've seen when cleaning out the dust bin. But this is too frustrating to recommend to anyone.

The primary features you want, that this model lacks is advanced navigation, mapping, and a higher capacity dirt bin. This literally bounces around from wall to wall (going over the same area like 20 times) to clean a room. This might work well for cleaning a large open room, but for doing a whole house it is terrible. It gets stuck quite frequently as well. We replaced it with a Roomba J7, and couldn't be happier. The newer vacuums hardly ever get stuck, and they clean in half the time by mapping the rooms - meaning they clean in rows.

You cannot set certain rooms to clean & certain places to avoid. I figured I’d just buy the barrier sensor separate. Nope, not available for this model. No remote either.

B0CNKX4429,1,Doesn’t work on hardwoods,"I bought this vacuum to replace a ten year old Roomba that I used daily. The old vacuum worked much better! This Roomba does not pick up crumbs and other small debris off of my hardwood floors, even on the highest suction setting. My house is a 1200 sq ft ranch style with all hardwoods. We don’t even have area rugs. The vacuum gets “lost” or stuck every single time it runs, even though I make sure to pick up any items off the floor. When I try to use the app to find it, it always says that the Roomba is offline. My kids have to look for it daily. The vacuum has never gone back to the charging unit on its own.","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2024"

The vacuum seems to go over the same areas many times and completely ignore others. Even the areas that it covers still leaves obvious small debris behind. It also gets stuck a lot.

B0CNKX4429,1,Dont buy it,"This is my first experience with an iRobot brand and I have to say its so poor I may never purchase another product by them. Where to even begin? I previously had an iON brand unit I picked up at walmart on sale for $69 it was amazing and for $69 we could not complain. After two years of working hard and being abused by my boys if finally started making noises and it was time. So I thought moving to a $100+ name brand unit was going to be an upgrade. Not even close. 1. This unit only has one side brush unlike my other unit that had one on each side, so unless its approaching the wall or nook and cranny from the right direction it does not grab anything near the wall or door or corner of the room. 2. Its constantly getting stuck, the height of the unit is just enough that if you have a hard wood floor that was laid after your cabinets the space between the floor and the base of the kitchen cabinet is just enough for the downward angle of the unit to get wedged and its stuck. If you have a piece of furniture with say a box, or laundry hamper just smaller than the width of the unit next to it the unit sometimes will get stuck in a perpetual loop of turning around and running into the same piece of furniture then doing it all over again and never leaves that couple of square feet. 3. The APP is horrible. Very few customization settings, my old iON unit i could fully remote control the unit like an RC car, I could also adjust the vacuum suction, its overall travel speed and much more. With this APP you can locate the unit if its stuck (that is often) and change its suction. That is about it. 4. Wedges under every couch we have. If you happen to have one of those electric recliners where its slightly higher from the floor than most this unit will wedge itself under the back every time it passes by. (see picture) 5. The brush is constantly turning on an off, I assume this is a battery feature, however its very annoying and it does not seem to clean as well with this occurring (again you cant change it in the app). 6. The ""human voice"" (if you want to call it that) that communicates various issues to you such as ""please place on a flat surface"" or tells you there is a problem, is extremely LOUD. Even more so than the unit running by ten fold. So there is no chance your going to run this unit at night and sleep without nightmares of a robot taking you in your sleep. Bottom line is this unit does the job, however you have to babysit it so much its almost easier to just get out the vacuum and do it by hand. There are a few rooms that don't trigger the unit getting stuck or calling for help for random reasons, so we do use it there. However for the price, your better off getting one of the off brand units for sure. Use it in rooms that have no cabinets, couches, or furniture with a curved leg (it likes to treat the curved leg like a dog in heat if you know what I mean and gets stuck). I WOULD RECCOMEND purchasing something else..","Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2024"

I can then choose rooms to be done. If I have it do all hardwood floors, it does them all without need for recharge. The ONLY advantage this Roomba has is self emptying. I guess I expected a name brand to have all those same features plus some, especially at $150 more than the offbrand. So I'm going back to my offbrand vac and giving this one away to my son. Unfortunately, brand names aren't always better. With all the pet hair, I'm tired of having to empty the Tikom after every run, but at least it does the whole house on a single charge, and has all the standard features that any other has.

It made the expected tone, signalling it was leaving its base; it backed up about four inches, then lost power and stopped. There were no lights on any of the control buttons, so even when I pushed the dock button, the vacuum didn't budge. I moved it back onto the chargers, and tried again.

It hasn't ran once without getting stuck (and more often than not, being 'stuck' is just the robot sitting in the middle of the room with nothing around it). I even shut doors to rooms so it only has the hallway or one simple room to clean, and it manages to screw up, run out of battery and never finish a job. On top of that, the blades on the bottom are BAD. After one semi-successful run (a miracle, honestly), I had to get scissors and CUT all the hair out of the bottom.

Shoes, backpacks, cords, stuff you'd think a robot vacuum would never go after. It also has no sense of direction/mapping so unless you're home to guide it where to go, it will likely stay in the same corner of a room for about 20 minutes. It gets under my desk and bumps in between the legs back and forth for almost the entire cycle if I don't move it, which defeats the entire point. And now, the thing is having mechanical issues and is dropping dirt everywhere. Haven't even had it for a year yet.

Additionally, I’ve had trouble connecting it to the app. I followed all the instructions, but it rarely syncs properly, which defeats the purpose of having a smart vacuum. Without the app, I can’t schedule cleanings or control it remotely, leaving me feeling like I wasted my money. When it does manage to clean, it doesn’t do a thorough job, often missing spots and leaving debris behind. Overall, I’m quite frustrated with this purchase. I expected more efficiency and convenience, but I’ve ended up with a vacuum that just adds to my cleaning chores instead of helping. I wouldn’t recommend this model.

B07R295MLS,5,Great and Easy to Use!,"Background: I have a shedding dog, so I bought this in hopes that by running it every-day, it would pick up on some of the dog hair on the floor. What I like: -VERY easy to use. -easy to follow instructions -has a sticker on the bottom so if it ever stops and beeps, you can flip it over and it says exactly what the beeps mean (one beep means one thing, two beeps means another--which is SUPER helpful!). -color on top clearly shows what mode it is in (blue-ready to go, orange-needs to charge, red-problem to fix-such as emptying the tray). -very quiet. I can work on stuff with it in the room and it does not bother me at all (my dog also does not mind it). -works great on white carpet and easily transitions from my living room to dining room (which has a slight bump). -when its low on battery, it does not die where it is at, it just turns off the vacuum then finds the home doc and charges itself. -just works really well. I run it everyday and I am impressed by how much stuff it gets (especially when it goes under things such as the couch). -if it gets caught on a cord, it usually takes 5-10 seconds but then it stops the suctioning and moves away (releasing the cord or other item). However if you have a small cord you should put it up (and you should regardless, I just noticed it doing this a few times and thought it was neat, but I do try to pick up all cords). What could be improved: -nothing really in particular to this. -It does not work well on anything black, but this is true for all robot vacuums. It sometimes gets stuck when it goes on the black carpet we have with the black chairs (I suspect because it can not detect them), but this has not happened often. My dog has a black mat for her food and water and it always bumps into it and spills the water, but again, this would occur with any robot vacuum. -Also, make sure the doc is against a wall because otherwise it will move and never charge (self explanatory, but I did not do the first time and it kept trying to doc and was just pushing the doc around the floor). -Finally, you do have to dump out the vacuum particles almost every time you run it (if you do a full circle/battery cycle). It is really easy to dump and beeps when it needs to be emptied. Again, nothing really negative, just something to note. Overall, I really like this! It does a nice job cleaning up the dog hair and other things that get on my floor and saves me a lot of time not vacuuming daily. If you have a dog, I would watch them with this first before you use it. My dog was initially scared of it but sniffed it's ""butt"" and now they are cool and she does not mind it at all. Pleased with this product and would recommend! :) **UPDATE** On another note, Eufy has amazing customer service! I received an email from them addressing each of my ""what could be improved"" components with more information on the product. Very impressed.","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2018"
B07R295MLS,5,Did not see it coming.,"I really did not expect to like this vacuum as much as I do. Let me explain. Have several other brand robot vacuums that I am very happy with. Our floors have never looked better. Due to architectural features of our very old house one small area needed a separate vac (either that or me with a handheld one). For a period of time this little veranda was cleaned daily by a semi-retired other brand vacuum but its battery was aged and it was time for a replacement. It is not a heavy traffic area but the cat litter robot is there as are several large potted plants. This little Eufy simply blew me away by what it manages to pick up! As I already explained, the area was by no means neglected (cleaned daily as a matter of fact!). But amount of pet hair (both dogs' and cats') this thing was gathering every time is simply mind boggling. I am also extremely impressed with how close to the edges Eufy is able to clean. It is very quiet, works efficiently, has a good size container and terrific suction. The things that I do not like are: this model does not self-empty, the cleaning pattern is haphazard instead of a methodical grid, does not send a ""help me"" message if stuck. But ALL of these negatives are outweighed by the quality of cleaning and extremely reasonable price. Even though there is no app, cleaning schedule was very easy to set up (it did not switch to daylight savings time automatically but this did not bother me). This model is quite slim, so it easily gets under the low furniture. I never dealt with Eufy brand before but now will absolutely consider their products. When it is time to replace our smarter self-emptying vacuums I might check out Eufy's offers first. Wonderful little vacuum, simply love it.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Pet Owner's Dream: The C20 Vacuum Review,"As a pet owner, I've struggled to find a vacuum that can keep up with the constant shedding and mess. But after using the C20 vacuum, I'm thrilled to say that my search is over. This vacuum is a game-changer for me because it can effortlessly remove pet hair from carpets, leaving them looking like new. I've tried countless vacuums in the past, but none have come close to the C20's performance. Besides this, it also works universally well on other surfaces (e.g. hardwood floors, tiles, etc) and does an awesome job removing all the dust/debris. The ease of use also really sets C20 apart from previous vacuum robots I owned. Setting it up was a breeze, and the intuitive interface makes it easy to get started. I can quickly switch between modes, adjust suction power, and schedule cleanings with just a few taps on the app. It's simple enough that even my non-tech-savvy family members can use it without any issues. Comparing C20 to my current iRobot S9+ which is more expensive and various other sorts like Roborocks, I think it's much more powerful, picking up dirt and debris with ease. Plus, the navigation system is far superior, allowing it to expertly map out your space and avoid obstacles. The app also seems to have more support that looks frequently updated. In short, the C20 vacuum is a must-have for any pet owner or homeowner looking for a reliable, efficient, and easy-to-use cleaning solution. I think I will stick to it for a long time.","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Excellent value and performance,"Upgraded our Eufy G40+ to this at the Black Friday discounted price - OUTSTANDING. I've wanted an ""active"" robot mop for years (vs the G40+ which was just a pad that the unit wet, kinda like a swiffer), and this one is just the ticket: * it is a steal at that price. I was debating it vs the X10 and have zero regrets going with the C20. Time will tell reliability etc, but customer service with Eufy in the past has been good. *Lidar is on the front vs top - mapping and navigation are excellent *it is slightly louder running than the G40 it replaces, but when it ""empties"" at the base station it is quieter (emptying thr vac is still loud, but it is less loud, and only a few seconds). ""Mop washing"" is about the same as a dishwasher or washing machine and only lasts a couple of minutes. The fan to dry the mop is not loud at all. *fits under our sofa easily *Cleaning comb works GREAT on our dog's long hair - some hair at the bearings end but very little on the roller itself. *base station is smaller then other mop vacs (that's good for us as we have limited space) *The filthy water coming out of the dirty tank makes it clear it's mopping well! *mop pads are dried with cool air. Some may not like that, but we're not bothered (no different than using a manual mop). It's not particularly loud. *obstacle avoidance is fine for us - it's not bumping furniture and has rolled around any large pieces in the floor. *it is doing astonishingly well for us on edges and in corners - much better than it's predecessor. *suction is crazy good. We usually run a vacuum on max, but I can run this on the lowest setting and still get a better clean than previous models we've had. Even with our hairy dogs and all the mess they track in and leave behind this thing got all the dirt and leaves other vacs have left behind.

B07R295MLS,5,"Not durable, makes loud noises after a short time","At first, I loved this little thing, and like many named it (Gary). It was impressive how every day it had a tray with a bunch of dust and dog hair in it. In my experience with vacuums and electronics, your product will last much longer if you take good care of it. Before going to bed, I ""Gary proof"" the house, picking up any random charging cables, socks, etc, and putting the dogs up so they don't have an accident streaked all over the house. I run it early morning at 2am. I empty the tray every morning, which takes less than a minute. Every week or so, usually monday morning, I spend less than 5 minutes to take the side brushes and roller off, and remove any hair/strings. This is probably much more frequently than you HAVE to do it, but with my experience in maintenance, I prefer to do it more often and regularly. He's a dumb vacuum, and occasionally gets stuck in weird places, or will grab a low hanging wire and get caught up, but it's a good thing he's dumb. We don't have true AI, so spending a ton on special sensors and algorithms to pretend that a smarter vacuum has been created, is just a waste of money. When looking at reviews for all the major robovac brands, they all get stuck occasionally and have issues. I don't care that Gary sometimes gets stuck, because it doesn't happen too frequently. A dumb robovac that runs regularly and has a decent battery life will make for a much cleaner home, and with much less effort, than vacuuming on my own. Will it sometimes miss a spot? Sure, but it eventually gets to it. Are there spots it can't get to? Yes, but those are spots that I'd have to get the hose and attachments out for anyways. Up to this point, I'd give this vacuum 5 stars. It's effective, and at a much more reasonable price than the competition. It does everything I need, and doesn't have a lot of extra crap thrown in there. So, why 3 stars then? It's not durable. There is something wrong in the design of the roller brush, or the containment of the roller brush, and it starts making a loud vibrating noise after a few months. I purchased it in May of 2018, and by August it was ridiculously loud. After a bunch of minor tests, that were already answered and then ignored in my initial email, and video I provided of how loud it was, they agreed it was faulty. Anker/Eufy sent me a replacement, after I sent mine back. They let me keep the extra accessories, such as the spare side brushes, the hair removal tool, and even the charging dock, and sent me what appeared to be a brand new robovac, packaging and accessories just like it ships from Amazon. It's now February, and the robovac is making the same loud noise again. I've done some extra troubleshooting on my own, and narrowed it down to the brush, or brush holder. As it's spinning, it's vibrating. All of the contact points are plastic. If I take the brush out, it stops vibrating. I put some thin foam tape between the enclosure of the brush and the plastic casing that holds it in, to see if the brush was causing it to vibrate. That didn't stop the sound. It's like the brush is bouncing around in it's housing. It looks like the spinning brush wears away at the casing that holds it in place. I don't see a way to repair it on my own, or to prevent it from happening again. We'll see how Anker handles the issue the second time. I'm not looking forward to dealing with it again, and I'm hesitant to recommend this to anyone else. It's important to note that I work from home, so running it during the day isn't conducive to me working. When it's working properly, it's quiet enough to run at night and not be a bother. It will randomly bump into a door sometimes, so if you're a light sleeper, it may be a problem, but for our family it's not an issue. It's only after it degrades and start making loud noises that it's an issue. If you have an empty house during the day, and it wouldn't matter if it's extra loud when it runs, then it would work perfectly fine. Edit:3/11/19 After some confusing back and forth with Eufy Support, they've replaced my 11S with a 30C and even through in some boundary strips. Initially they just wanted to replace it completely, but I was concerned that it would just break again, this time out of warranty. They offered to upgrade to the 30. After I sent it, another support rep reached out saying they should have troubleshot the robovac more, and not to send it in as they had some other tests to do and if that didn't fix it, they could fix the roller. I let them know I already sent it. I asked if they could send me a 30C so I'd get wifi as well, and I'd pay the difference. They said they couldn't ship the 30C because Amazon owned it. While waiting for my robovac to get to them, the 35C came out, and it's listed for sale from their website. I asked if that could be sent instead, and again I'd pay the difference. They said they couldn't, but they'd ship an extra boundary set for the confusion earlier. I thought they said they'd send the 30C, not the 30, so responded that would be good. They cleared it up saying they could send the 30 with an extra boundary strip or the 30C without it. I chose 30C without. They decided to send the 30C and the extra boundary strip! Way over the top support, trying to make me happy. I wasn't upset, or being a jerk about it, they were just extremely accommodating. Based on the great customer support (minus minor confusions, some on my part) I'm bumping it up to a 5 star. They really stand behind their products. I also think any future issues that may pop up can be alleviated with troubleshooting the roller brush, which should be replaced occasionally anyways.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2019"
B07R295MLS,5,"A watch bot never picks up that lint, but give it time!","This review is very similar to my 11S+ review -- I loved the 11S+ so much that I bought the 11S Max for upstairs, wanting the higher suction for use on carpet. Lots of negative reviews from people who seem to have not understood that this is a random motion robot. Keeping your expectations in line and realizing that even with a random pattern the whole house will eventually be covered at least every few days, which is way more than I ever vacuumed manually. Another source of bad reviews is the frequent comment that it is ""lacking"" internet connectivity. For me that's a huge bonus as I didn't want an internet connected device because many consumer grade IOT devices have very poor security. I bought two similar models, one downstairs and one upstairs. We have dark laminate flooring downstairs and it felt like even if I vacuumed regularly there'd still be stuff showing up shortly after I finished. I'd do a whole house vacuum every week, but it still felt like I couldn't keep up, so I initially bought the 11S+. I loved it so much that I bought this 11S Max for upstairs just a short time later. Since the 11S+ is so similar, I'll combine details from both in this review as they're relevant here too. For context, this is in a household with two long-haired adults, no kids, no pets. Downstairs on laminate and tile flooring with only an area rug and fairly basic furniture everything works perfectly. The initial robot got stuck once on day two in a corner where I had some chairs stacked up and gained the nickname ""Waldo""... ""Wall-e, the garbage collecting robot... got stuck... where is he? Where's Waldo?!"", but hasn't gotten stuck anywhere since. It reliably finds its way home every day. Every day at lunchtime I come downstairs from my home office and empty the bin and I'm shocked by how much stuff is in it, wondering how I ever lived in such dirty conditions! haha My wife and I agreed that this is the best thing ever, so I bought another for upstairs, which has carpeted floors. Things are a bit different there. Nearly every single room upstairs has an obstacle that it doesn't like, and I've had to do a LOT more robot-proofing. It found its way into the walk-in closet and got tangled on a shirt that had a string fringe and got stuck. It gets up on the legs of the clothes drying rack in the bedroom and makes a LOT of noise going over them, repeatedly. It got stuck under the bed in the guest bedroom that had JUST enough clearance to get under, but not back out. In the home offices it gets hung up on desk legs. In my office it gets up on the legs of my music stand. Once it started beeping after going a bit too far over the edge of the stairs. The downstairs robot can go about its business daily w/o any problem, but the upstairs one has a problem in every single room. I'm gradually finding ways to deal with the problems room by room (such as 3d printed bumpers on the desk legs), but it has been somewhat of a challenge. Like the downstairs robot it's SHOCKING how much crap the thing picks up every day, even after a deep vacuuming with our Sebo D4. Being as this one gets stuck so often it got the nickname Dodo. I still love it, it keeps things cleaner, but does require a lot more babysitting. Over time I expect it'll get better as I continue to robot-proof to keep it away from areas where it shouldn't be. As for the long hair mentioned before: On day 1 I tested before a deep-vacuuming, with about 2 weeks of accumulation and it got REALLY tangled with hair, but I did a deep vacuuming by hand and since then it has kept up enough that hair has not been a problem at all. Pros: Very quiet, good coverage (I seldom see a missed spot), picks up a crazy amount of stuff even when you think there's nothing for it to find, cheap maintenance parts, easy setup, no apps nor wifi connectivity to phone home and potentially compromise your home network. Cons: None if your house is robot-proof, some people may have zero problems, some might have a LOT of problems. The filters for the MAX are a bit harder to find than the non MAX models. I did try to swap the dust bins between my two units and they are interchangeable. I'm not sure which filter is better than the other, but I might eventually replace the dust bin with one from an 11S so that I can use the more commonly available filters. I suspect that the filter change is part of why the MAX models have a higher suction rating as the simpler filter probably has less air-flow restriction, but I do like having the pre-filter on the other unit as it's easier to keep clean.","Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2021"
B07R295MLS,5,"Well worth the money for saving time, energy, and effort","This (really long) review is for the Eufy 11S Max robot vacuum (Robovac). Please note “Max” vs regular 11S. They may look the same; but the Max uses a different filter and has the higher 2000pa suction. Otherwise the functions and options (other than suction choices) are the same. I've used the 11S Max for the last month on my low pile carpet (about 80% of the roaming area) with the rest being tile or linoleum flooring. It has been quite fascinating to watch so I've actually put about 85-90 charge cycles on the unit over the last month (yes, three times a day on most days and it's still finding more dirt/dust than I would expect). Right up front, I'd definitely buy another when it comes time to replace this one. After comparing how I vacuum my flooring, especially to pick up my biggest carpet enemy; short stray bits of dried grass stems, the “random” wandering of this vacuum model made more sense to me than the other fancier choices. Most vacs do a good job with dust, dirt, sand, cheerios, etc. but these stem pieces are only picked up by a vacuum when it comes at the stem with the brush roller pretty much parallel to the stem. That means random directions will more likely get these pesky problems than an organized back & forth cleaning approach. Granted it may take a few cleaning cycles or several passes over the same area during one cycle; but since the Robovac has completed its first 5-6 cycles I rarely find them anymore or if I do spot one it's not for very long. Robovac is a big time saver as well as an energy saver for me. I would use my canister vacuum about an hour each week for routine cleaning and once a month for 2+ hours to do a more thorough cleaning. A watt-hour meter indicated that my canister vacuum used 5-6 kw-hr of electricity each month. Robovac uses about 12 watts continuously for about 4 hours when charging (surprisingly less than the 5-6 hrs listed in the manual; but it is brand new). Once the battery is charged, the power consumption drops to about ½ watt. When Robovac is away cleaning, the charging base uses just ¼ watt for the homing beacon. So if used just once a day; Robovac would only use about 60 watts per day. That means once-a-day cleaning would only use 1.8 Kw-hr energy per month. By letting Robovac take over the regular weekly cleaning with once a day operation (or less), I'm able to cut my electric bill by an easy 3-4 kw-hr/month. With that said, there are a few things that I think need improved: First, there should be an interlock on the dust bin – Robovac will merrily go off about it's scheduled cleaning cycle without the bin installed! So if removed for emptying; don't forget to re-install the bin before the next scheduled operation. Plus, I noticed on a couple occasions, that I wasn't paying attention and I left one corner was about 1/8” out from fully inserted. Not sure if that will cause suction leaks; but you need to make sure the bin is completely inserted. Second, you can't select “max” (or any power level) when using the remote to manually clean an area. It appears to only operate on “standard” suction with manual operation (i.e., when Robovac is not running a regular cleaning mode and you chose to override it's direction). In addition, if you select the remotes' edge or spot cleaning modes it will automatically go to “max” power for the duration of that mode and you can't choose IQBoost or standard power level on those selections. Third, I don't know why the 20 minutes for edge cleaning or 30 minutes for quick cleaning was selected. Robovac can make it about 60-70% around my home in the 20 minutes of edge cleaning. If edge cleaning mode was permitted to run until it made a trip all way around and back to the charging station where it could dock to finish that mode would work better. An alternate solution would be if I could set the cycle time for edge cleaning and quick cleaning modes. Plus I'd like having an option for it to simply stop when the time is up rather than automatically returning to the base. When I want just one room cleaned; I'll set Robovac to auto or quick mode in that room, then close the door or put down a barrier, and return later to stop it manually and take it back to the charging base. If I don't return in a timely manner Robovac will be trying to locate the charging base and running the battery down. Fourth, Robovac cleans edges using only its right side pretty much all of the time. It would be helpful to have it randomly choose using either the right or left side whenever edge cleaning. I watched it edge clean a carpet/wall area three times going only in a counterclockwise direction (right side) and it still didn't pick up all the dust bunnies. I used manual control with it hugging the wall on its left side and it picked them up with no problem. Also, be aware that manual operation, when Robovac is not already working in a selected cleaning mode (overriding current movement), only works while the remote buttons are pressed. Robovac stops all functions shortly after a button is released when used manually. Fifth, I really don't need to run Robovac on a daily schedule – there should be a weekly scheduling capability even for the least expensive robot vacuums. It shouldn't be that difficult or expensive to update this model to correct this issue. Even if it's the same set cleaning time, every day for the selected days; just give me the ability to schedule cleaning cycles one to seven times a week. Sixth, when the battery runs low, Robovac can take forever, if it makes it back at all, to the charging base. I will routinely go looking for it if I haven't seen it return within 10-15 minutes after the approximate cleaning time has passed. The age-old solution for solving a maze (your home from Robovacs' perspective) is to constantly follow along obstacles using just one side (Robovac does recognize when it's circling something like a coffee table and adjusts accordingly after a 360 degree rotation). This method is how Robovac tries getting closer to the charging station when it's more than about 15ft away and not in line-of-sight (the charging base emits an infrared signal for homing action – make sure you keep Robovacs' bumper and the base clean). Sometimes Robovac occasionally gets diverted or the software tells it to try something different) and it will go off in another (often wrong) direction (extremely frustrating!). I highly recommend observing Robovac perform it's return operation from various areas in your home. I ended up placing a 2x4 along the end legs of my sofa as Robovac was consistently going along the side skirt, under the skirt at front of the sofa, then around the front leg exiting the side of the skirt, and then heading straight across the room. It would then go thru three other rooms and come back to the sofa again. The 2x4 forced Robovac to continue edging under the sofa, along the back wall, and out the other end which has an end table that mimics the 2x4 at the opposite end. Before using the 2x4, Robovac took well over an hour to get back to the charging base (it eventually changes up it's routine, usually after three tries) and required 5 hrs to recharge. With the 2x4, Robovac has been able to get back from the far end of my house to the charging base in under 20 minutes very consistently. While the ability to improve Robovacs' return mode is really limited to what you can do, the key point I'm making here is that the battery will always give you more charge cycles (longer life) before needing replacement if you can get Robovac back to the charging base as soon possible. Seventh, pay attention to the thin rubber wiping strip on the brush guard. After 60+ cycles I noticed the ends of the thin rubber strip (about 1/16” of it's height) were tearing away. I believe this was most likely due to moving back and forth over edging from tile/linoleum to carpet or maybe due to the floor mounted furnace registers in my home. I simply trimmed the torn bits off to keep them from getting caught by the brush. After about 100 cycles I noted the rest of the 1/16” strip was now gone. This impacts the tile/linoleum cleaning far more than carpet; but it is something to watch for. I highly recommend checking the rubber strip during brush cleaning and purchasing a brush guard replacement as part of a maintenance set. Hopefully the manufacturer will improve the thickness or type of material used to prevent or at least reduce this problem occurring in the future. Next, a few helpful hints I've learned or didn't find in the owner's manual: The “bowl” shape on top of the charging base with the white LED is just right to hold the remote control, button-side up. However, I prefer to turn remote controls' button-side down to keep them cleaner so it's up to you if you use it or not. I've had a few occasions when Robovac actually bumped into the charging base so it was no longer sitting square against the wall. This will impact it's ability to find the base when the battery is low. I took a used rectangular-shaped one quart motor oil bottle from my recycling bin, cleaned it thoroughly, and filled it with sand. It's now a 3-4lb weight sitting on top of the charging base. I haven't had the base re-positioned since adding the weight. Normally Robovac does a good job avoiding the charging base; but not always. Robovac “parks” about 1/2” away from the charging base tower. If you are careful, you can swipe a cloth over the bumper sensors to clean off any surface dust that has collected (always seems to be some); however, be careful as Robovac might activate while you are doing this. You might also get a solid red indicator without any beeps. This error isn't described in the manual; but I've found if I just lift Robovac off the charging base for few seconds and then replace it, it will change back to the charging orange color. (I suspect the solid red indicates a sensor error) It's also quite easy to remove/replace the dust bin during charging. Unfortunately you will need to flip Robovac on it's back to remove/clean the side and roller brushes as well as the bottom IR sensors and charging contacts, so remember to turn Robovac off with the topside button before doing this or get used to it trying to start up while you are cleaning it. Also make sure the blue/orange indicator light is on when you reposition it on the base. Sometimes Robovac will remain off rather than return to charging mode. After two or three cleaning cycles I'll do a regular check on the all the brushes and swap left and right side brushes when they are re-installed; seems to straighten and make them work a little better, maybe last longer too. Oddly the remote control spot clean button symbol and the manual indicate a clockwise spiral for the cleaning operation; but when I've selected it, Robovac has always used a counterclockwise rotation. If the side brushes happen to “hang up” on something, Robovac will stop spinning them while it maneuvers around the obstacle and then restart the brushes when it thinks it is clear. Don't assume there's a problem when you see this unless Robovac beeps and the indicator turns red. The flat handle end of a spoon or fork works great for prying the filter free from the bin for cleaning. Every time I have tried using my fingers; it pops out tossing dust/lint everywhere. The IQBoost mode doesn't seem to change going from hard flooring to low pile carpet or vice versa in my home. I think this is because the low pile carpet just doesn't cause enough “drag” for it to recognize that it could adjust the suction level. (I'm still not clear as to whether there's just two suction levels or if Robovac can vary linearly between the two) While the manual indicates a 40 min run time in “max” mode with medium nap carpet, I'm obtaining about 60 minutes with my low nap carpet. I do find the “max” mode clearly picks up more dust. I ran Robovac 20+ times on IQ mode before switching to “max” for its scheduled operation. The filter has clearly shown a thicker layer of accumulation on the filter. When “max” mode is set as default you will occasionally hear the vacuum whining noise change briefly. Best I can figure is it's a software glitch where the IQBoost code tries to adjust the suction level; but then resets it to max. I normally hear this shortly after Robovac goes from one flooring type to another. It also occurs shortly after it starts it's routine. Robovac does not communicate back to the remote. So if for instance, you press edge cleaning and Robovac doesn't get the message, the remote will show it should be performing edge cleaning even though it's not. Similar situation when Robovac is recharging or is returning to recharge; the remote will still show it's in the selected cleaning mode rather than the “charging” icon. You simply have to pay attention that Robovac has recognized your command by a “beep”. I found using the basketball nozzle with my Ryobi P737 inflator does an excellent job cleaning the filter. It takes only a couple minutes to clean both the filter and the bin (outdoors of course!). The original filter has been cleaned well over 100 times now and other than being a little dingy it's still working great. This should help stretch the recommended replacement interval to more than 2 months compared to the recommended “tapping it” to clean. Do not use the “canned” compressed air as I frequently find it wets surfaces during extended spraying and the Robovac filter is a paper element. If you have a sofa, chair, etc, with stiff or heavy cloth skirting down to the floor; I suggest safety pinning up at least a foot or two of the skirting on an open side. When or if Robovac switches to using the proximity mode for cleaning AFTER it gets under the furniture, the skirt will appear like a wall and it will keep running around underneath the furniture until it switches to a collision mode where the weight of the skirt generally will not trip the bumper sensors and stop it from escaping. I'm glad I've used Robovac during the daytime so I could track it down and figure out what trouble it got into during its normal operation or when I expected it to be back at the charging base. The alarm beep sounds can easily be missed when it's far away from you. Plus, when it powers down after getting stuck can make it lot more challenging to find! It's a lot easier to locate when the vacuum sound is still going or even if it's just the quieter wheel motors running it around looking for the charging base. To wrap up my review. I've found Robovac to be a well built, nicely designed, and quite durable robot vacuum. The $160 price I paid is quite reasonable with excellent cleaning ability (given it has about 1/10 the suction of a typical canister vac). It has good battery run times (my mixed flooring on IQ mode lets Robovac run about 80-85 minutes before recharging), and it is a wonderful time and energy saver. If you've been thinking about a robot vacuum without all the extras (or just don't like vacuuming), the Eufy 11S Max is a great choice.","Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2022"
B07R295MLS,5,Over a year in use... study this review for real analysis,"Summary: I read a LOT of reviews about a LOT of products of a similar nature before I leapt in to buy this, my first robot. Overall, this product was good SOLID value for the money. I have now owned it for for OVER a year now, used daily and this analysis is based on close observations during that period. NOT one of those folks who buy it an write a review five minutes after they pull something out of the box. Here are the key points you should consider when buying a Robot to sweep your floors. 1. Price - Look...Price was definitely a consideration at buy in. I studied many models before I bought this one. These kinds of robots overall cost money. $$$. Of course, I am old school. These days some folks buy a Cell phone that cost $500 dollars to $1000 and think nothing of it. To me that is WAY too much. Ditto many models of similar robots. At the time I bought it the robot was on sale so I got a price that was $100 cheaper than competitors whose reviews read about the same as this one did. So the buy in pricewise was a good solid deal that was in what I consider the medium to upper low cost affordability range. Perhaps you would think nothing of spending $850 on a robot. Not me. Like goldilocks, this one was just right. SECRET Costs you may not think about: Some reviews address this, but consider these things as being costs IN ADDITION to buy in: Filters: This thing has a filter. I recall one review whining that filters cost too much. Let me be clear. If you want a new HEPA filter for it every week or two, they will cost you. Me? The filter does not seem to me to very critical since I do not really plan on the robot cleaning my air. It gets dirty and dusty. As a result, I pull it every other use and wash it out under a faucet in my kitchen (a two minute job), let it dry a bit and then put it right back in the machine (Which is super easy to do...no tools or anything - just pull out - click in.) After reading one alarmist review prior to buying, I bought one spare filter at the same time I bought the robot thinking I might find it was true. So far, after a year or more of use, I STILL have not replaced the filter. Just keep using the original. Think about it. Brushes - I bought a kit with spare brushes when I bought the robot. Glad I did. Buy at least one set just to you have them around when you need them. The brushes twirl around and shove cat hair into the maw of the thing as it races around. Somewhere. Somehow, as it toodled about around the six month mark, it threw a brush. (They snap on and off easily) Like a horse throwing a shoe, this is to be expected. This thing runs all over on its own so I could not find where it lost it. To this day I STILL have not found the missing brush. No problem. I just grabbed a spare, snapped it on and it kept on going. Tools - The kit I bought early came with a little cleaning/maintenance tool. See my section on Maintenance below about tools. 2. Utility - Utility to me means ease of use. Based on a year of hard use for my robot you should consider the following lessons learned about utility: CLEANING FLOORS a. Does is really sweep ALL the floor? Read a lot of reviews and looked at a variety of designs. Some reviews that I recall said ""This thing finds a LOT of dirt. Where does it get it all?"" After a year of emptying it (You DO need to empty its evening sweep into your trash, usually every day - VERY easy to do - again click out- click in) I totally agree! This thing finds a TON of dirt and dust that is NOT obvious to the naked eye. Frankly, that is its job and I need to make clear here that it does its job really really well. VERY SATISFIED b. To be utter clear however... I have a three story house. To define that though that is two stories with WOODEN and some tile Floors and a third floor that is mixed wood, carpet and concrete. PRO: I cheat. One robot for three floors of my house! Every day or two I pick it up from its charger, move it from floor to floor to let it clean a different floor whenever the mood strikes me. Works great! More, this thing cleans almost all of those floors flawlessly - especially the wood, tile and concrete bits. It sneaks into lots and lots of corners, under furniture and stuff and it never, ever runs off the edge of stairs. Completely satisfied. I admit I may be so satisfied because wood, tile and concrete are 92% of my floors and it is flawless on those types of floors. CON: This is a real review, not a feel good propaganda babble. If there is a con to this robot it is carpets. Specifically, it WILL work across modern carpet. That is carpet that is tight, laid level with the rest of the floor and has nothing to hang it up on. However, it struggles to go over edges, so if there is an edge to your carpet, a strip that it has to ride up over OR (Like me) you have a carpet or two that are Persian Style rugs with tassels at the end, just be advised that it WILL choke as it tries to cross these barriers. You can still do these surfaces, but you will have to stay nearby and bail it out when/if it hangs up... which feels time wasting. This should not make you hesitate to buy based on this review UNLESS you have a lot of these carpet barrier things about your house, in which case you will be annoyed by this robot. To be fair however, you may be annoyed by ANY robot under those conditions. Just think about it before you buy. ******** Utility NOTE! This is a final note on utility. The REAL Nemesis of any robot is WIRES/Cords. Once you own one, you will figure this out pretty quick. You will need to get your cords under control since the robots will find power cords on computers, lamps etcetera and choke up on them. 80% of the time when it does not return to its charger at after you program it to clean (Smart folks program that between 1AM and 3AM - unless you tell it to go manually for some reason) you will have to track it down to find it hung up on wires. Once again, to be fair, I think this is true of virtually all robots. They are not too bright about wires. The other 20% of hang-ups comes from some oddity in your furniture. I have particular chair in my study whose side supports are JUST a bit too short for the robot to go under, so it drive in there and wedges itself into the spot and cannot get free on its own. Just to you know, this is fair enough, robot makers cannot anticipate every single possible piece of odd furniture. Just figure it out through trial and error, but enjoy all the cleaning it does WITHOUT you paying the slightest attention. A small price to pay. *********Utility NOTE 2: The control - Comes with a remote. To be frank, I only use two or three features on the control. I tested them all at the beginning, but I've forgotten what the rest do. Most used? Manual use button. Because of how I use it on other floors, the automatic run feature is only good on one floor. Works flawlessly as far as I can see. I tote it to the second floor, put it down, hit the manual timed button and off it goes. I wander back up an hour two later, hit the off button and walk it back to its charger. Second most used? The recharge button - This tells it got back to recharge station manually. If you you do not want it to keep going you can interrupt its cycle and it will go back to its recharging. Usually use this when I am watching a show, it starts on its own and I find the noise distracts me from watching. Third most used feature? The manual steering controls. One review I read said this machine is really stupid. That is half true. It does fine most of the time, but if you want to steer it manually on occasion you can. I have a table I want to make sure it does under in a certain way, so I just point and click it to drive it into the bits when I want them to be cleaned. 3. Maintenance - Look. Old soldiers will tell you. Preventative maintenance will allow you to keep using your equipment day in and day out. This robot IS reliable IF you know you will need to maintain it! If you are lazy you will hate doing maintenance. I just make it part of day's routine and do not resent it. Thus I am very satisfied. My routine is to pick it up about 5 PM, sit and work on it for three to five minutes WHILE I watch TV. WHAT? You cry! Why so much work! The work is there because the robot does its job. All you are doing is making sure it keeps doing the job without hassle. Once again, whatever nonsense if advertised, I imagine ALL robots require this kind of looking after. PLAN on it. This one I suspect is no better or worse than any other. Do not go into it blind though. Here is what you need to know: a. You will need a little tool to do maintenance. If you buy the little kit with filters, brushes and a tool in it, know this. The tool is a hokey little plastic thing that CAN work... but takes a bit more time to use. Specifically it has a comb to clear tangle in your brushes. This works well. It has a little brush to brush dust off filters, off the inside of the dust/dirt collection box, etc. This works adequately. It ALSO has a little razor blade letter opener thing on one side intended to clear hair from rotors (Two types) This is a weak tool that works, but is time consuming and tedious to use. You are better off getting a little tool with steel blade or hook on it. Something you can use to really dig hair out of spots where it winds itself around a brush or rotor. Dig through your kitchen drawers, tool boxes or the $2.00 bins a the hardware store until you find something that works better for you. Maintenance: Enemy number one if long hairs. I have two women in the house. I am sure they do not mean to shed, but shed it they do somehow. This is what happens. As the little brushes turn they pick up hair and push some of it into the bin...BUT they also wind around and around the spinning brushes. Every other cleaning I find a wad of it around both brushes. There is also a rotor on the bottom the turns and does the sweeping up.. It ALSO picks up long hairs. Some will wind around the rotor proper and must be cut off or pulled off. This is the easy part. The hard part is that some will wind around at the ends where the bristles stop. This is where the recommended tool I mentioned will pay for itself as the hair tends to knot up tight in wind after wind. You will have to dig it out and cut it loose. You must also empty the bin at the same time. I also wash the bin out now and then along with the filter. Once a month or month and half the front wheel may also need to be tugged out (It pulls out and pushed back in easily) It ALSO gets hair down in there around its axle, though not nearly as fast as the rotors and brushes do. That is it. I will only close by saying I have NOT owned every robot in the world, but I imagine these periodic maintenance requirements will be very similar for ANY robot... NOT just this one, so if my maintenance picture here appear to be too gloomy, don't let it be. OVERALL: I am totally sold on having a slave machine keep my floors swept. Rather it than me! Call me lazy bones. A little maintenance now and then is well worth this machine. Go ahead and buy one. Jump in the water's fine.","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2021"
B07R295MLS,5,Genuinely Impressed,"This is the first robotic vacuum I've owned, and so far, I'm thoroughly impressed with it. After reading reviews for many different brands/models, I ended up choosing the ""dumber"" Ankler Eufy model that just has the infrared remote since the smarter, app-controlled models only worked through a cloud app. Yuck. The remote is intuitive and has decent range and coverage, so the few times I've needed to manually drive the robovac have been trouble-free. I also like not having to launch an app or worry about spotty wifi/internet outages affecting my ability to control the vac. The price was also really reasonable considering the features, performance, and other positive reviews. I've got two large dogs, mostly hardwood upstairs, a single room with linoleum, medium pile carpet in the bedrooms, low pile carpet in the basement, and various low/medium pile rugs. This thing does well on all of them (except the shaggy bathroom mat, but that's to be expected). It's a total lifesaver as I was usually vacuuming daily and there was still dog hair all over the place. After an initial charge, during which time I ran the regular upright vacuum, I let it run two cleaning cycles on the first day, and each time it came back with a mostly full dust bin. I was both impressed and grossed out by all that it picked up *after* a regular vacuuming. PROS: * This thing is super quiet. I typically leave it on ""Auto"" mode where it only sets the vacuum to max when it thinks it needs it, and even then, it's no louder than the tower fan I keep on at night for ambient noise. If it goes under a couch or bed, you often can't hear it at all until it resurfaces. I scheduled it to clean at 6am, and it cleaned under my bed without waking me. Love waking up to freshly vacuumed floors. * Its edge cleaning mode is fantastic. I usually keep ceiling fans on 24/7, so any dog hair/lint on the hardwood tends to accumulate into tumbleweeds along the baseboards. If you set it to edge clean cycle, it'll find a wall and follow it all the way around the house, room to room. Doing that every day manually was extremely tedious, and this little robot does it with aplomb. Having two side brushes is also welcome so that it cleans a path along the edge in addition to the edge itself. It also works really well around appliances (refrigerator, oven, etc) and will pull in dust/hair/crumbs from slightly underneath them. * It's incredibly thin and can clean under all of my furniture. Under my couch, desk, entertainment center, and bed have never been cleaner as they are difficult to move to clean underneath. The wand on my upright vacuum could only partially clean under these, but this bot has no issues as long as any cables are picked up and out of the way. * Battery life is decent and within the advertised range. I've gotten between an hour and two hours of cleaning time, depending on how often it had to kick the vacuum to max. The stated average runtime is 100 minutes, and I've seen both less and more than that, so no complaints with the battery life. The battery is also easily replaceable as the lithium battery will inevitably degrade and need replacement at some point. * It has decent obstacle detection and avoidance, but still bumps into things from time to time. Most of the time, it will stop/steer clear of obstacles without physically bumping into them. However, it doesn't seem to pick up any dark colored obstacles like my espresso coffee and end tables, black bed frame, or black refrigerator; it tends to need to bump into those before it detects their proximity. Still, it always seems to gently tap them versus ramming into them full throttle, so I haven't noticed any dents/dings/scratches from its use. I've also got many large houseplants on the floor, and it cleans/navigates around their bases very well without knocking them over. * In auto mode, it seems to take the most random path it can find. e.g. it will enter a room and make one swipe before leaving and coming back later for another pass. However, this is pretty normal for robo vacs from what I've read (at least the ones that don't have advanced mapping). That said, it does still provide excellent coverage over time, especially when run on schedule or twice daily. More specialized modes likes edge and spot cleaning are quite thorough, though. This isn't going to replace your regular vacuum, but it's not meant to. I used to run the upright vacuum daily to keep up with the dogs. Now, I can do a full vacuum once a week or so and let this little guy maintain in between, and in that, it is doing a great job. * The dust bin, pre-filter, and foam filter are all washable with water which is great. The only part that can't be is the fine air filter. I'm not sure if the dust bin is dishwasher safe, but a quick spray from the sink sprayer is usually sufficient. CONS: Most of the ""cons"" are petty things, hence the 5-star review. Just figured I'd mention them to round out my experience. * The side brushes don't appear to be incredibly resilient. After about 6 or 7 cleaning cycles, they started to curve outward against the direction of spin. I'm not sure how negatively this impacts its cleaning ability, but I figured they would last a little longer (I am still using them, and it's still doing a good job, so I guess I'll find out). It did come with two spares, which is nice, but I'm a little concerned about how often I might need to re-order replacements. Considering I've never owned a robovac before, this could just be par for the course, so I'm not going to knock any stars off the review for it at this time. * The ""remove before use"" sticker didn't peel all the way off and left some ugly residue on the top (nothing a little Goo Gone can't fix). While very sleek, it's also a fingerprint magnet, so keep a tack cloth on hand if keeping it shiny is important to you. * It's not a huge gripe considering I purposely chose a dumber model to avoid having to rely on an app (which does have this feature), but I wish the scheduler was a little more advanced. The scheduler on this model is about as smart as a clock radio from the days of yore, only allowing a fixed time for it to run every day. Having an option for day of the week or the option for a second schedule (e.g. run once in morning, once in evening) would be nice. * The base has a little space for the remote to sit in, but I'm unsure if the remote has to be in that or otherwise within line of sight of the vac to start it on schedule. The one time I left the remote in another room, it didn't start on schedule the next day, though that could have been operator error on my part since that was the first day I had it. I've since left the remote in the caddy on the base, and it's run on schedule since. My concern with that would be the dog deciding the remote would make a good chew toy. Directions do not mention anything along those lines and imply the remote just programs the bot to start at that time. * The base is a little light, and even against a wall, the vac would sometimes push the base to a weird angle and be unable to dock. I noticed this when I had the base in the living room on the hardwood. I've since moved the base to a carpeted room against a wall, and it hasn't been an issue. So, I do wish the base were a little heavier and/or the rubber strips on the bottom had more grip. Overall, I couldn't be happier with this vacuum. It's not the smartest model out there, but for the price, it has an excellent feature set, does a great job, and doesn't have to connect to the cloud. A small number of other reviewers mentioned issues started cropping up 6-8 months after purchase, so time will tell whether I encounter any issues. Those reviewers also said Ankler has excellent customer service, so while that's great, I hope I don't have to reach out to them. So far, though, I'm highly impressed and may purchase another for downstairs so I don't have to carry it back and forth.","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2021"
B07R295MLS,5,Updated - I was skeptical,"-- Updated Review - October 27, 2021 -- Our poor RoboVac 'Rosie' had a mental breakdown where I ended up contacting Anker Support. 'Rosie' was stopping every few inches, rotating in place, and going another few inches, and kept repeating this pattern until she return to her charger or die in the middle of the floor. There were other issues that appeared but were traced back to this main issue. I was in email contact with Rita with Anker support, she suggested I do some tests. Eventually, it came down to the front of the bumper that was overly scuffed and scratched. She sent me out a new one which fixed the problem. Then another issue arose. An off sound from one of the motors. It had a very faint sound of clicking. After running some tests it was the right brush motor that was the issue. I assume it was a gear tooth in the motor that had broke. Rita sent me a new motor to replace it. I am very satisfied with the customer service I received and the free parts they sent me to fix my 'Rosie.' Rita was very helpful and she gave me instructions on the tests to run and how to replace the parts. She even offered to replace the RobotVac if I wasn't comfortable in switching out the parts. Anker stands by their warranty and will do what it takes to fix your RobotVac or just replace it altogether if it gets too technical. -- Original Review - June 11, 2021 -- Who knew a robot vacuum would clean better than I do?!? I am shocked that she fines as much dirt as she does every day. Of course, with 3 people and a dog who tracks in almost everything from the outdoors, maybe I'm not that shocked. I've had this little robot vac for almost 3 months now. We named her Rosie, from The Jetsons. HAHA. This is actually the second one because the first one had some battery errors that Anker support told me to just return her to amazon since she was only a few days old. Every night at 10:30 PM Rosie goes out in the night and cleans. During the day, I'll set her out to clean the second floor and/or the basement. Sometimes she is cleaning 3 times a day. I worry I might be overusing her and eventually wear out her components faster. I do have a few issues with her though. She requires maintenance every day or every other day: 1) Cleaning the roller brush left end. The reason is that hair gets wound up around the roller brush end axle so tight that it errors out. I've been cleaning the brush almost daily to prevent it from burning out the motor. The last thing I want is a broken robot vac. Worst, having to buy replacement parts! I wish Anker would come up with a way to prevent hair from winding around this area. 2) To extend the life of the side brushes, I've been rotating them and cleaning them. I am not a fan of having to buy replacement items for her. She does come with 2 replacement side brushes, but I have not used them yet. 3) To extend the life of the filter, after every clean cycle she completes, I empty the ""dust collector"" compartment and tap the filter on the side of the trash can to try to get rid of as much of the dust as possible. I also blow out both the dust compartment and the filter with a compressed air bottle. I saw a question here asking if you can wash out the filter. I might try it when blowing it out no longer works. She does come with an extra air filter, but I have not used it yet. 4) This is not a daily maintenance task, but an issue. The brush guard covering the roller brush has this rubber piece that spans the back of the brush guard that I think helps corral the dust and debris to be sucked up into the dust compartment. Half of it tore. I'm sure it might have gotten caught on something when Rossie went over our floor registers (vent covers) or something else. I'm not thrilled this happened. However, instead of calling Anker support, I decided to use some electoral tape. I had to take it apart to apply the tape that folds over the rubber piece lengthwise. Too early to say if it works. I just did it. 5) She does not do edge cleaning very well. When set to this mode, or even in automatic cleaning mode, she will do the wall edges, but when she is going along the edge, she will come out of the wall a few inches and go back to the wall. Missing whatever dust or debris that might be there. I do not know why, there is nothing in her way, the floor texture is the same as the floor she just went over, and her sensors are clean. Also, she does not do 90-degree inset corners at all! After a few weeks, I notice a lot of debris in the corners. After watching her go along the edges, I see that she 1) does not have long enough side brush to reach the inside corner, and 2) she will sense the inside corner wall too early and turn, missing the corner. She will also sometimes pull around an outset 90-degree corners too much. Therefore, she does not hug the wall very well in general. 6) She tries to climb sloped bases to floor fans or desk legs, etc., eventually getting stuck. I made a 2-inch base for the floor fans, so she won't try to climb them. Although I can't do much for the other sloped surfaces. 7) She will also get stuck under our bathroom freestanding vanity that has an opening under it that also has sloped inward legs that she will get wedged under. Therefore, we just close the door to that bathroom to prevent her from going into it. I might put a piece of wood behind the opening to prevent her from going under it. I know the above grievances sound like major issues, but they are not. I am overall very thrilled to have this little vacuum and think it has been a blessing to have her. We love her, clean her, and enjoy her in our household. I would do anything to make her cleaning job easier. I would recommend this robot vacuum to anyone who is considering getting one. I wish I had one for each floor. But cannot afford to do so even though this is one of the cheapest robot vacuums out there. A funny story involving Rosie. One morning I noticed she did not return to the charging base. I went out looking for her with the remote. I kept pressing the start button on the remote to get her to respond. I kept hearing a faint beeping sound but could not determine where it was coming from. I narrowed it down to the living room sofa, a chair next to the sofa, and a box between the two. I looked under and around the sofa and the chair. I was confused about where she could be. The beeping sounds were muffled, and I thought maybe she somehow wounded up in the basement. Before looking in the basement I decided to move the box out of the way. Lo and behold she was under the box! I didn't place the box there the night before, so I had no idea it was actually a lid to another box. It must have been on its side. When Rosie was cleaning, she ran into the lid, bumping it and therefore making it fall on top of her. Trapping her inside! It was a pretty funny situation. If she could blush or feel anything, I'm sure she would be embarrassed. LOL I hope this was a useful review! Thanks for reading it!","Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2021"
B07R295MLS,5,"Efficient, Sleek, and Hands-Free Cleaning for Smaller Spaces","Play Video I live in an 800 sqft condo with mostly hardwood floors and a few small rugs, and the Eufy Omni C20 has proven to be a great fit for my space. Here’s a breakdown of my experience with the vacuum: 1. Ease of Use The Omni C20 is incredibly easy to set up. After plugging it in and filling the water tank, I was good to go. The water tank is very user-friendly, with a convenient handle and a well-sealed cover that prevents leaks, which is a common issue with some competitor models. The ambient light under the water tank adds a cool visual touch, making the vacuum feel a bit more premium. 2. Lidar/Proximity Sensor Upgrade The lidar and proximity sensors on this model are a major improvement over other robots I’ve used. Coming from the Eufy X8 and Dreame D10 Plus, both of which had solid lidar systems, I’ve noticed the Omni C20 maps my apartment much more efficiently. In my previous models, the first mapping session could take 20-30 minutes, and the robots didn’t always distinguish between walls and furniture. The Omni C20, however, only takes about 3 minutes to complete the initial mapping and does a 3D scan, accurately identifying solid walls from furniture like countertops. Very impressive! 3. Sleek Design and Low Profile While the lidar sensor is much improved, what really stands out is the Omni C20’s sleek design. Unlike my previous robots, which had a visible sensor bump on top (think of the lidar sensors on autonomous cars like Waymo), the Omni C20 has a slim, almost Tesla-like profile. The entire body is only about 3 inches tall, allowing it to easily go under tight spaces like couches and cabinets. I’m not sure how Eufy managed to achieve this, but it’s a big plus for anyone with limited clearance. 4. Good Surface Detection and Nice Cleaning Performance with a small trade off The C20 does a great job of differentiating between surfaces. It switches seamlessly between mopping and vacuuming when it detects a change in floor type, even when it comes to something as small as a door mat. Its cleaning performance is impressive, though it’s not the fastest robot out there. On average, it takes about 1 minute per 10 sqft for a combined mop-vacuum cleaning session. For comparison, my Dreame D10 does the job almost twice as fast. However, the C20 delivers superior cleaning results and even goes back to wash the mop during the cleaning cycle, which contributes to the longer duration but is a great feature. I’m happy with the trade-off since the C20 offers a more thorough clean. 5. Ok Battery Life and Long Charging One of the few drawbacks I’ve noticed is the battery life. It’s not the best in its class. On average, the C20 uses about 60% of its battery to clean my entire 800 sqft apartment. By contrast, my Dreame D10 only uses about 30% for a similar cleaning. The C20 also has a slower charging time, taking over 3 hours to fully recharge. However, given its smaller profile and ability to clean tighter spaces, I’m okay with the trade-off. 6. Mop Drying Noise Another small concern is that the robot produces a low, constant noise for a few hours while it dries the mop after cleaning. While it doesn’t use hot air drying like some competitors, it’s a more energy-efficient approach. This isn’t a major issue for me since it’s part of the self-sustaining, hands-free cleaning process. I’m happy to let it do its job and dry, charge, and clean itself without any intervention from me. Conclusion Overall, the Eufy Omni C20 offers a fantastic hands-free experience with impressive cleaning performance and thoughtful design. While it’s not the fastest in terms of cleaning time or battery life, the superior mapping, sleek profile, and thorough cleaning make it well worth the investment. If you have a smaller space, like a studio or a 1-3 bedroom condo, this is a great robot vacuum to consider. However, if you have a larger home and need longer battery life, you might want to explore other options, especially bigger ones. For me, it’s been a great fit, and I’m very happy with the results.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Quiet but powerful,"This little machine is awesome! I have been shocked at how much dust the Eufy picks up every time I use it! I call it Georgina, my new cleaning lady that only does floors. Seriously, this robo vac easily goes under all the furniture, which has become difficult for me with back issues. The vac has no problem detecting the stairs and gently bumps into furniture and changes direction. Because of the layout of my house, I have been blocking off rooms and let her clean two at a time or close the bedroom doors and let her go for 45 minutes to an hour in each. This way I know each room is getting vacuumed. Because of this, I don't use the scheduling feature, although I did use it the first few times and it worked fine. I like how she hugs the baseboards and gets close to corners. I have hardwood with area rugs and tile in the kitchen and foyer. Eufy easily goes from one floor type to the other, going over the saddle separator. I had hesitated getting a robo vac because I was concerned the brushes and wheels might scratch the wood floors. My concern was unfounded because the brushes are soft and the wheels are rubber and gentle on the floors. Eufy is very quiet yet the suction is great. I am always amazed at how much dust is in the bin, and I've been running it just about every day. I would say it's picking up just about as well as the upright. If you unblock the rooms, Eufy robo vac will find its way back to the charging station on her own when she needs to recharge. I am so glad I treated myself to this - it was definitely worth it!","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Perfect vacuum,"I recently upgraded to the eufy Robot Vacuum Omni C20, and it has truly transformed my cleaning routine. The all-in-one station is incredibly convenient, with features like auto emptying, washing, and drying. The transparent water tanks are a thoughtful touch, making it easy to keep an eye on water levels without any hassle. One of the standout features is its ultra-slim 3.35-inch design, which allows it to clean under furniture and in tight spaces that are usually hard to reach. This has significantly reduced the amount of manual cleaning I need to do. The 7,000 Pa suction power is impressive, easily picking up dirt, crumbs, and pet hair. However, I did notice that its performance can vary slightly depending on the type of flooring and the amount of dust. The Mop Master Technology is another highlight, with its 180 rotations per minute and 6N of pressure making quick work of tough stains. The dual sweeping and mopping modules are a great addition, allowing for simultaneous cleaning and maximizing efficiency. One minor downside is that the Pro-Detangle Comb, while effective, requires occasional manual intervention to remove very stubborn hair tangles. But overall, this is a small price to pay for the convenience and thorough cleaning the C20 provides. In summary, the eufy Robot Vacuum Omni C20 is a fantastic investment for anyone looking to simplify their cleaning routine. Its powerful suction, slim design, and advanced mopping technology make it a standout choice. Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,I like it alot,"This is my first one. My friends have them and they are loud and I didn't like that. This does get stuck like some people say and you have to find it but it is not the error of the vacuum, it is our problem for having low furniture that it gets stuck under. When it's lost it's almost always the same place, understand the low seat. This cleans very well. I havn't used the remote yet so I can't comment on that. When it's hits a corner it adjusts a tightly to try to go back in a straight line, but since no one lives in a box that means it's all over the place, again, not a fault of the vacuum. I like it ALOT. If it doesn't get stuck it finds ita way back to the base. I like the cutter that comes with it. We have long hair cats and I never knew how much they shed. The cutter allows you to zip down and cut It right off. I took off the wheel once to clean the sides and it is super easy. You open the bottom rectangle that holds the brush and take it out. That easy! I needed to do this because the long hair from the cats got in the side. It still worked, it was just my preference. My kids call it Eufey (oof-e). Where's Eufey???","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,"Great vacuum, especially if you can get it on sale!","We bought this because I didn't have time to sweep our LVP floors every day after the kids dropped all their crumbs everywhere. It is amazing! You can set it on a timer so it goes off at the same time each day, or just turn it on when it works for you. It's been able to sense our stairs just fine and has never fallen down them, doesn't scuff up walls or furniture. Sometimes my spouse says the vacuum struggles to find the docking station after vacuuming, but I've never noticed (though there have been times where it's seemed lost, but with a little patience it always finds the right way to go). It's great for hard floors, not so much rugs/carpet. It'll go on rugs, even our high pile rug, but it isn't able to get anything off of them and it gets stuck (on the high pile rug. On the low pile rug it's never had a problem). The thing I love most about this is that it's short enough to fit under our couches, bedframe, dresser, etc and you will be disgusted by how much dust/dirt it picks up during that first vacuum. We had to empty the tray several times that first day, but now I empty it about once a week or so. We usually run it every day.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Best Petsitter Ever,"I don't consider my house clean unless the floors are spotless. With 2 dogs and 2 cats (one of whom sheds enough to knit a sweater each year), my house rarely meets my own unattainable standards. Eufy gets me close. When I first fired up this gizmo, my husband stood--arms akimbo and brow raised-- wondering what sort of nonsense I had wasted our money on now. Eufy bumped into EVERYTHING like a drunken, mischievous toddler. The pets were perplexed, wondering what this strange new animal was. I ended up emptying the bin 6 times on that initial run, much to my horror. Where had all this filth come from? Eufy has gotten smarter since, yet is still foiled by the bathroom vanity, getting stuck and crying for help. She makes it back to her dock most nights so long as an errant rug or dog doesn't waylay her. She frequently gets high centered on the lip between our tile and hardwood floors. She's eaten more than a few dog toys as well. She does not get along with our French Bulldog, Jussi. He's quite mad that her name and his are so close in pronunciation. This is not helped by the fact that she keeps running into his ankles whenever he least suspects. Jussi has declared an all out war on her much to the delight of our sadistic felines who observe the goings on from far above. There's a metaphor in there somewhere, I'm sure. Pros: - excellent battery life - entertaining for pets, guests, your permenantly stoned uncle, etc. - sparkly clean floors - beautiful, sleek design - fits under almost all our furniture Cons - harasses the dog, though he does deserve it","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2018"
B07R295MLS,5,The 11S max is a wonderful vacuum! The L60 SES is exceptional.,"11S Max- Pros: I was pleasantly surprised at the accuracy, power, and slim fit (goes under my dusty dresser, nightstands, and bed). Picks up hair and dust and bits of stuff well! It vacuums for a good lonbb go time so every to Ingush sparkling clean, and the remote control has just enough functionality not to be confusing or over the top. I have another Eufy vac (L60 SES) and although this doesn’t have as many features, I can honestly say it is WELL worth the money. It has saved me so much time just in the last few days. I like the timer feature so it cleans the same time each day and I’m sure things stay tidy. Cons: I can’t think of too many honestly. I just use it for our large bedroom and master bathroom. If it were for the whole house I’d get a mapping model. You do have to empty the dirt tray each time, and I have to cut off the hair from the brushes with the included hair remover. Again, for a large area I’d get the other model which has the hair cutter and automatic emptier. Too much time to take hair off all the time for a large area. But for my large bedroom and bath it’s money well spent! L60SES pros: it cleans very very well. I love the hair cutting and automatic emptying feature. The mapping feature works really well, and the vacuum follows the schedules well. I have been very pleased with this purchase and it is saving me tons of time. I have three shedding cats and the hair was driving me crazy. I like that it empties into a station and I just have to change out the bag. It has other nice features like quiet mode. I absolutely would recommend this and the 11S (see other review) ; they serve different purposes depending on needs. L60SES cons: none really, except that it does get caught occasionally trying to get under furniture, but it turns off if it stalls too long so it doesn’t drain the battery. Overall I would purchase the 11S air smaller spaces and the L60SES for larger homes with multiple rooms. Love them both! Sorry I’d don’t buy them sooner.","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,"Excellent Robot Vacuum, Especially for the Price","I have been an iRobot Roomba buyer since 2007. My last Roomba bit the dust this month, and I did a ton of research before buying a replacement. I went with the Eufy for a few reasons: price point, cleaning power, quietness, and sleek design. Price: Very reasonable. Almost reasonable enough that I'd consider getting another one for my second floor. For now I'll just carry it upstairs. Cleaning power: This thing sucks... It's suction is much stronger than my Roombas have had. It picks up so much dust and pet hair. We do a full vacuum every other week with my Dyson, so I think of the robot vacuum as a supplemental vacuum. I was shocked at how much was in the dustbin after it's inaugural cleaning! The picture attached to this is from that cleaning. It also gets a ton of dust in the little dust filter. In one of the video reviews I watched, the reviewer said it didn't pick up anything in that dust filter... So maybe my carpet is particularly dusty, because it has a thick layer after each cleaning. Quietness: I work from my home office, and this thing is quiet enough that I don't even turn it off during conference calls. This might be the thing I am most impressed with. My last Roomba was LOUD-- you couldn't even have a conversation with someone in the same room, let alone someone on speakerphone. Sleek design: I love/hate this. It definitely looks modern and cool, and more like an art piece than an appliance, but it shows all my finger prints, and now I keep a glasses cleaning cloth nearby so I can rub it down. I suppose if I only use the remote and never pick it up, this won't be an issue. A few considerations: I was hoping to find a robot vacuum that wouldn't eat my carpets' tassels, but I don't think that vacuum exists. I have only used the Eufy 4 times so far, and it doesn't always get its brushes wrapped around the long tassels, but it does sometimes. It seems to realize it sooner than my Roomba did at least. The Roomba would sometimes rip gobs of them off in a single cleaning. I try to tuck them under the edge of the rug and that doesn't seem to bother Eufy. It has pulled off probably 2 tassels so far. The cleaning pattern seems pretty random. I saw some other vacuums that chart out complex maps of your home, and Eufy doesn't seem to do that. But, it doesn't seem to matter, because it still hits every spot in the rooms. I'm a little concerned about durability. My Roombas ran for many, many years with easily replaceable parts. We'll have to see if Eufy has the same longevity. All in all- I'm very happy with my purchase and definitely recommend it!","Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2018"

The slim design is a game-changer—it fits under my furniture effortlessly, cleaning places I never thought it could reach. What really stands out is how smart it is. The obstacle avoidance is spot-on, and it never gets stuck on cords or random objects. The suction power is strong enough to pick up dust, pet hair, and crumbs with ease, leaving my floors spotless every time. I also love the mopping feature—it’s not just a vacuum but a great combo device for hard floors. The only small downside is that it doesn’t have a self-emptying function, so I have to empty the dustbin after every use, but that’s a minor inconvenience for how well it cleans.

B07R295MLS,5,"I finally pulled the trigger, and you should too.","As a single father, who has a maid service come in every two weeks, I've considered getting a robot vacuum for quite some time for that gap, and was always highly skeptical, because of the mixed reviews on most, and the cost. I own two pugs, and they shed. One of them is a tiny, longer haired one, and WOW does it shed. After purchasing this item, I moved a few things in the house for the robot, only to realize my maid has not been moving anything when she cleans - there was dog fur and dust EVERYWHERE, under anything that was parked. I have a main level and a lower level to my house. The main level on my house has a kitchen, a dining room, and a living room, with linoleum wood flooring, and multiple rugs. I stood and watched this vacuum work the three rooms for the entire run (45mins to an hour?). I was extremely skeptical it would cover everything, as its travel patterns seem erratic, but I paid attention to where there were bits, here and there, and it got everything! It even vacuumed all my rugs. The rugs weren't weren't perfectly free from dog hair, but pretty close, and way better than the maid had been getting them (I assume she didn't vacuum them). The vacuum never got stuck, and didn't have any trouble getting up on a semi thick rug. It accurately noticed the lip on the small stairs, and when it was done, it found its base, and parked itself. I looked in the tray, and it looked exactly like all the pictures - full of dust and dog hair. That seemed like a pretty successful run, and I was fairly impressed. Now to the lower level. This is where my family room and one of my bathrooms are, and this has wood flooring, with an enormous, thick shag rug, right in front of a fireplace, and relatively high couches. I figured this would be IMPOSSIBLE, and would be a train wreck. There was no way it was going to succeed with that shag carpet, and it was going to get stuck under the couches. So I put the vacuum in a corner, where it had no choice, but to run over the shag carpet, all but sure it would be locked in that space forever. To my surprise, the vacuum scaled the thick shag carpet, and started vacuuming it! It was really slow, when going across this rug, but it was doing its job! This just blew my mind! Just as I expected, the robot made a b line for the couch, at an opening that it could get under, and I was sure this was game over. It was going to get stuck, beep at me, and my dreams of letting this thing run at night were completely over. It went under there, and I could hear turning, trying to get out, but hitting rails, etc. It pushed some hidden surprises out from under the couch, and it seemed to be spending a long while under there. To my surprise, it eventually found its way out, with no help from me! It even went under there a few more times, and always managed to make its way back out! I stayed and watched this thing, memorized by how thorough, and how versatile, this ""dumb"" robot was (it's dumb, because it doesn't map, and doesn't talk to Alexa). It made it over the lips to other rooms, and into the bathroom. It navigated away from the basement stairs. When it was done, its tray was full of tiny little rocks, or something, the dogs had dragged in, along with a mountain of dog hair. I ran it later that night, thinking there's probably more fur to be had, and sure enough, I ended up with another tray load, which means I should probably be emptying this thing daily. The only trip up this thing had, was it stopped at night, when it sucked in a shoe string from the shoe rack. I pulled the shoe string out, turned it back on, and it did its thing, and found its way home when it was done. It also has once closed the bathroom door, and ended up stuck in there - I let it out, and closed the door. I bought this on the black Friday sale... It was one of the cheaper ones with good reviews. I was concerned that I might not be getting the best bang for my buck, because there are smart vacuums out there (at least 1 I know of, that starts with a 'T') that are within the range of this one, but I think I made the right choice, because if you read the reviews, they do some cool things, but they have some major drawbacks (like falling off stairs at night, and losing their mapping sporadically). If this thing mapped, I don't think you could place it in different rooms, and have it do its thing. It would have to live in one location. I can drag this thing upstairs, and have it do the bedrooms, if I want! For being my first robot vacuum, I have to say I'm extremely impressed. I'll update this review if that changes, but I'm so impressed, I think I'd buy another one right this second, if it were on sale, and I hadn't spent so much money on toys over black Friday! Heck, maybe even a third, or fourth for every level of my house...","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2018"

This product uses amazing engineering to make it easy to clean and high-quality materials so it will last a long time.

B07R295MLS,5,Makes my life so much easier,"I hate vacuuming: the wrestling to get the machine out of the closet; the twisting of the hose; the machine getting caught on it's own cord so that the wheels don't roll; the canister banging into my ankles if I give the hose a yank when the machine gets caught on the aforementioned cord. I really dislike it. But we have two dogs and a cat, which means there's a lot of fur, so the house needs vacuuming every two days or so. (In truth, it needs vacuuming twice a day, but that ain't gonna happen.) Quick assessment: I love the Eufy! I love it so much, I bought a second one. We have a mix of flat-weave rugs, hardwood floors, and one low-pile shag. The Eufy handles all of those with ease. The other thing I like about the machine is that it's profile is so low, it can get underneath our low bed frame and our sofa. (Our standard sized Meile can't reach either of those places, and I love being able to remove fur and dust bunnies on a regular basis.) It does a good job on the pet fur. And you won't believe the dust it will find. It may leave a few random bits of fur around furniture legs if it's on a rug -- but really, you have to look for the fur. It's not a huge, noticeable mess. And if you run the vacuum every day (and it's so easy, why not?) it keeps spaces fairly-fur free. It would not be able to handle a high pile rug -- like a flokati -- anything over say 1 inch would be a problem for this vac, I think. You also need to tie up your lamp cords, extension cords, and if you have a long bedspread that drapes on the floor, you'll need to flip up the corners of that or the Eufy will get stuck on it. If you have a rug with long fringe, you'd probably need to tuck the fringe under the rug before running the Eufy. (NOTE: I have a rug with 2"" long fringe, and it doesn't seem to be a problem for the Eufy -- I never bother with flipping the fringe under.) It has a hard time navigating over high door sills (1"" high). Sometimes it makes it out of one of the basement bedrooms and down the hall, but other times it gets stuck. (But we have one of those Jack and Jill bedroom arrangements where there's a bathroom between the two bedrooms, and the bathroom door sills are lower/a more standard height. The Eufy can cut through the bathroom and get to the other bedroom easily. It's only our square, too-high door sills that it has an issue with. As long as the bedroom rugs are clean, I'm happy.) The dust compartment is on the small side, so if you have pets, you'll need to empty that on a regular basis. I'm in the habit of cleaning mine out every day after it runs. But I have been able to go up to three days without dumping it -- How often you need to empty it will depend on the amount of dirt/fur that's on your floor. You can program it to automatically run at a certain time (or times) every day. And if you're home when it's running and you can see an area that needs more attention, you can use the little remote to make it go back over to that area. Oh -- if you have any furniture that is wobbly, you'll want to secure that before running the Eufy. If it bumps into a wobbly piece of furniture that has breakables on it, things are going to fall over. So get things mounted to the wall if necessary. The Eufy has a rubber bumper around its body, so if it does bump into things, it won't scratch, dent or mark up furniture legs or walls. It can't do stairs. And it won't get the dust/fur that lands on the top edge of your baseboards. So it's not like you can totally give up using a regular vacuum. But it definitely makes life easier. If you have a large, open room / house, you may find the Eufy cleans one area better than another. For example, our living room, kitchen, dining room and den are all part of one, 58' x 28' floorpan. The charging station for the Eufy was located in the dining area. It seemed like the Eufy spent a ton of time cleaning the dining area and the kitchen and the living room, but never really made it down to the den. We ended up moving the Eufy out of that room after one use because we have a china cabinet on very spindly legs, and when the Eufy bumped it, the whole thing almost came crashing down (see earlier note about mounting wobbly furniture to walls.) So I don't really know whether the Eufy would have eventually figured its way around the entire space or not. But it does fine navigating the top floor of the house, which is about 28' x 24', and it seems to do well in those basement rooms, which is 24' x 42'","Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2019"
B07R295MLS,5,Impressed!,"This is my first robot vacuum so I don't have much to compare it to; however, I gave it a tough job that I struggle to keep up with and it worked fantastic. I have a long haired dog who sheds non-stop and it was able to handle a week's worth of dust puppies and detritus with only being emptied and cleaned once. That brings me to the second part. Whoever designed this thing gets it. All brushes are removable for cleaning and a tool is provided to do such. The roller brush pops out to remove long stands of hair or string and the feeding brush pops off to remove tangles. It's easier to maintain than my regular vacuum, but I guess that is the point. As it ages I'll update based on wear and tear but it was a worth while purchase and I highly recommend it. I wonder if they make fun stickers to customize lol.","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,very impressive vacuum,"I never thought I would want a robot vacuum, but I decided to try one to see if I could keep on top of my floors better with a bit of help. This model had great ratings, and the price was reasonable, so I decided to give it a try. I was so surprised at the amount of debris it removed from my floors. I have since ordered 2 more so I can have one on each floor. Simple to set up and use. I spend a few minutes making sure there is nothing that could be tipped over or get caught up and then turn it loss. Love it. Highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2024"

I works great for the time period but starts getting expensive. I think i have bought 4 of the the 11s. Purchased the model expecting it to be the same but have removed the left side sweeper on the model and it is a really bad model. With only one sweeper it will not leave a room you have to stop it take it to another room then do the same. I would not purchase this model ever again and my advise is to stay away from it. Not worth the time or money. Have nothing against Eufy might try another model but the engineers have ruined the 11s again not worth buying.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Great value! Eufy is hardworking!,"I just renovated a 1960s rancher, and had to move in while reno was still ongoing. Needless to say, there was and is lots of dust. To add to the mix, I have three cats whose favorite hobby is shedding. A 60 year old, self-avowed cat lady, I could not keep up with the dust and hair. I had a Shark robo vac which I used on a carpeted floor. It did not do a great job, and I was constantly getting messages that Lurch's sidewheel was stuck, usually under a king sized bed. I would have to rake it out from under with a golf club. The Shark also left cat hair in the carpet. I took the Shark, along with my three cats, to my Florida condo where there was no carpet. The Shark still got stuck, could never find its dock, and just didn't do a great job cleaning. This Eufy beats that Shark like a drum! I have no carpet in this house, but do have a couple of washable rugs. Eufy does a great job on the LVP, hardwoods, and rugs alike. The only time it has gotten stuck was when it sucked up an electrical cord. Its bumper is more sensitive than the Shark's, so Eufy doesn't push lightweight items around. Eufy was easy to set up, and did a good 30 minute run right out of the box. There's a remote control with it, and a nifty tool for cleaning the brush. The instruction book is a bit vague on what all you can get it to do, and the icons in the book didn't match up with the ones on the remote, but I haven't used the remote for it yet, as it runs perfectly by just pushing the go button on Eufy's back. It sucks up and collects all the cat hair it can find, and is still getting its share of construction gerbis. I thought I would never be able to walk barefoot in this house, but Eufy has changed that! Eufy finds its dock when the charge gets low. Its low profile enables it to get under sofas and chairs. The collection tank is easy to empty and clean. The brush is easy to remove, and the tool makes for easy and quick cleaning of it. Eufy is reasonably quiet. My only complaint is that Eufy doesn't sense stairs and drop offs like my old Shark. The first time I turned Eufy on, it raced straight for the sun room doors, and over the edge-a good 6 inch drop-and landed on its back like a dying bug. The construction is strong enough to withstand the drop, but I block off that opening when Eufy is now on the job. Eufy's full charge gives a long run time that will clean a good 1000 feet of space. Overall, Eufy is a powerful little vac, and well worth the price. There's no app, like with the Shark, but you can set it to run with the remote. If you have hard floors and pets, don't hesitate to get this thing! Caveat: I cannot attest to how much cat weight Eufy will support, as I cannot get mine to ride it.","Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Seems Very Good,"Initial response is that this works very well. Cleans edges, fairly quiet and wood floor feels so nice to walk on afterwards. Tends to miss small edge space between area rug and floor, but maybe using a higher vacuum level would help that. I just had it on lowest power. I was thinking my place is too small to need this, but now I think it was a good investment.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,"I was going to leave a bad beview, but...","I just can't. Full disclosure, I drunk-shopped this vacuum. Drunk shopping is one of the great pleasures in life. Admit it, you've done it too. It's always a great surprise when something randomly shows up on your porch you forgot that you ordered. Adult Drunkmas. Anyway, I asked Alexa what the best robot vacuum was (between asking her if she really works for the CIA, and opening another beer). She told me it was this one, and it was on sale for under $200 too! Well heck, my electronic friend, order that Bad Boy up and do your thing with the super fast delivery. So, bottom line, I didn't read about this vacuum, and really didn't know what I was getting. Backstory. Every good drunk-shopping experience has one. If you don't like backstories and want together right to the review, skip the next couple of paragraphs. I had another robot vacuum a couple years ago, paid well over $500 for it. It worked pretty well initially, and was a ""smart vacuum"" that memorized my floor plan. If it ran out of juice before it was done with the whole house, it went back to the docking station for a fill up, and then started where it left off. Cool stuff right there. It also marched like a Union Soldier in boot camp. Beautiful straight lines, and perfect 180 degree turns. Never missed a spot. Until it had a stroke, that is. Wally (what we named it, you know why, Pixar Fans) went crazy and lost the floor plan. It'd randomly get stuck, and call for help in its little electronic voice. We'd have to rescue it from dead center in the middle of the living room with nothing in the way. We'd reset it, reboot it, update software and it'd work for awhile, and then stroke out again. Then, the gears for the wheels stripped, and it was dead. Only lasted a year or so. Poor Form, Wally, poor form indeed. So, I thought I was buying another smart vacuum at less than half the price! What a deal, huh?!? Yeah. Not so much. If it seems too good to be true, it is. This vacuum (Goofy, more on that later) is a stupid vacuum. It doesn't memorize anything. It's basically a bumper car that flails about until it hits something, then randomly turns around and sucks somewhere else. Hey, at least I know this one isn't uploading my floor plan to the CIA, right? Okay, check that. It does have some sense, it's not totally random. It somehow sees walls, chairs and stuff and manages to clean around the baseboards. It also finds its way out of the back bedroom where it sleeps, marches down two different hallways, and pretty much gets every room in the house. Not sure how it does it, but it does manage somehow. Maybe it's an idiot savant? It's quiet too, very quiet. I have it set on ""Boost IQ"" so it's supposed to suck more when it needs to. Again, I don't know how it is supposed know when to suck harder, but you can randomly hear its suckage increase. If you set it on Max, it sucks all the time. Big suckage drains the battery a lot faster, and it is considerably louder, so we leave it on medium suck. There's a trade off for the quietness, it does't suck as much stuff up as my expensive vacuum did. Don't think this vacuum (or likely any robot vacuum for that matter) is going to retire your Dyson. They just don't suck as much. Still, I get a lot of stuff in the little bin, and it goes under the bed and other places you wouldn't suck with your Dyson. So it sucks about right. Leave it in Max if you want it to suck more. *Note* ""Suck"" is a good thing in this review. Saying your vacuum sucks, is one of the few products this works with. I dig the remote, makes programming easy, and you don't have to be on your knees to do it. It'll only let you vacuum every day, there is no setting for every other day, weekends off or the like. It also has a ""dock"" button, so you can send it home anytime. Another nice thing that Goofy does is it finds the dock 99% of the time. Something the $500 vacuum didn't do. Goofy got stuck under two nightstands in one room, so I blocked them off, and it is fine everywhere else. Climbs bath mats, throw rugs and transitions between tile and carpet great as well. The other one didn't. Bin is easy to empty, just don't tip it or it'll puke out what it ate. The brusk is only about half the width of the machine. It has whiskers to flip crumbs into the brush, they work okay, but sometimes it just kicks crumbs out of the way. Kinda wish the brush was wider. So, I though I was getting a $500+ vacuum for $200... I didn't, I got a $200 vacuum. My mistake, it does work, so no bad review. Oh, why Goofy? Because of the stylized 'E' on the lid. Wife saw that and thought eufy was gufy. Therefore Goofy. That, and it's randomly goofy wandering about....","Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2020"

B07R295MLS,5,Works better than some more expensive brands.,"I rad a review of various robot vacuums, and this was featured as one that worked better than most others. I had never owned one, but thought it might save me some time eliminating the need to constantly vacuum under beds and other furniture. My daughter had another more expensive brand, but hated the fact that it had to be constantly be reprogrammed for different rooms. This one needs not programming, it just keeps going more or less randomly, but does remember where it has been on this round, and will return to the charging station when the battery runs down. I was surprised at how much dirt it picked up even after I had done a manual vacuum of the entire room, including under the beds!","Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,A very great basic Robo Vac,"This is a great Robo Vac for small houses. A lot of points have been covered in other reviews so I'll post the things I wish I knew before ordering. These aren't really negatives given the price, just things to consider if you want a higher end model. The vac's cleaning path is essentially random. It vacuums in a straight line until it either bumps something or senses a solid object like a wall or furniture with its IR. Depending on the layout of your house, furniture, objects there is no telling where and when he will go (I named him Oofie). This means he will inevitably hit areas on the house several times and could possibly never make it to others before the battery runs out. I've watched him bounce around a room, exit and then immediately reenter and bounce around the same room several times in a row. My house is small, right around 1,000 sqft though and he generally hits everything at least once per shift. If not, we will not likely miss the same area again next time. However, if he was cleaning a much larger area and kept hitting the same room over and over, he might consistently miss areas. Another thing to keep in mind is that this Vac (and probably most Robo Vacs) are for maintenance and not deep cleaning. If you go forever without cleaning your floors, don't expect this Vac to deep clean everything by itself. Run it every day (the timer makes it easy) and empty his dustbin and it will definitely keep everything clean. It will suck up pet hair, dirt, cat litter and even things as fine as powder. Mine has sucked up things as big as a marble. The Vac cannot sense if it's sucking up something it shouldn't so you need to ""baby proof"" your house a bit. Mine has tried to suck up cords, power cables, socks, string, a dryer sheet and other things. If something really gets jammed, the Vac will pause and beep (cry for help) and you can usually pretty easily free him. However, if a long string gets wound around the rolling brush or the rotors, it can take a while to undo. He will also gobble up fringes if your rugs have them. You'll learn what you need to keep up off the floor. The rotor brushes extend pretty far past the edge of his body so he does clean corners well. Instead of hitting a wall and bouncing away, he will sometimes follow it, bouncing along the wall until he finds a corner which cleans pretty well. He is strong enough to move light objects and boxes around. I run him daily and even if my floors look clean, we still comes back with a bin 3/4 full of pet hair. I don't know where he finds it all. I can't comment on how well he cleans carpet my house is all hardwood or vinyl. Mine came with magnetic strips that you can use to set up barriers that he won't cross. I keep him out of the bathroom just because of the possibility of water on the floor. If you have an animal that 💩 on the floor, it IS an absolute disaster when he hits it. He smears it and leaves a trail everywhere. I almost though I was going to have to throw him away but he is disassemble-able enough that you can clean him. Replacement parts are also readily available on Amazon. It's a rarity, my cat just sometimes ""misses"" the litter box so I'm going to use the magnetic strips to keep him away. All in all this has been a great value. I literally haven't swept my floor in 6 months. I got mine on sale for 220 so that's just a little more than 1.20 a day so far to not have to sweep and dropping every day that I have him, which is a bargain for me. He runs about 1.5 hours on a charge. No mapping or anything to let him know he is done. He just bounces around until battery goes low, then he slowly creeps around until he finds his dock and automatically parks. Besides daily emptying the bin and occasionally freeing him from a bind, there is essentially no maintenance. If he got destroyed or just stopped working, I would probably buy this model again. If I had a larger house or carpet, I would look to larger and pricer models with more features. TLDR: if your house is 1000-1500 sqft this is a great buy.","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2021"

B07R295MLS,5,"Best cat toy ever, mom","There are so many choices out there now, i found it somewhat daunting to select the best robot vacuum for our needs. And with 3 cats who all shed a lot i worried about the sheer volume if fur tumble weeds! But after reading reviews for hours, i finally settled on the Eufy 11S, 1300pa. I am very pleased with it. Its anazing houch it collects on floors you think are ckean! I probably could have chosen the Max version with stronger suction. Its not that much more and the only reason i didn't was because i wasn't sure if it would be too strong and get hung up on my very light dining room carpet. (It most likely wouldn't after having observing the regular version) I had heard so many stories about robots that had issues, were complicated to set up, didn't work as advertised etc etc. And some, like that well-known brand, are just ridiculously expensive!! First, i could think of no reason why i would need to have it connected to the internet, or to map it, given the variety settings this Eufy has. So paying extra for those features was unnecessary for me and this brand has some models that handle that, if you do. Right out of the box, it was very simple to set up and took all of 10 minutes. It comes with a little charge so you can have it dock properly right away. After docking, it took about 3 hours to fully charge the first time and away we went! The unit comes with one extra set of brushes and filters so you don't have to order extras right away. A nice little bonus. The first run, i monitored where it went and figured out where i had hazards i had not thought about when i did my initial “baby proofing”. I found it best to pick up cat dishes and the cat mat, papers or receipts that fall off the coffee table, small area rugs that are so light Eufy pushes them around, and bathmats that have fringe. It did get stuck on my sleep number bed cords (which i thought would be too large to worry about) and the corners of my dining room rug (which is a very, very light rug) sometimes give it a challenge but it hops over them after a few seconds. It scared me as it raced toward the stairs but stopped just as it was supposed to. Oddly, Eufy refused to go into one closet we have. There is no light in this closet. I finally figured out it simply couldn't tell if it was safe to proceed. I hung a shop light in there and it solved the issue. This Eufy has several patterns you can set. Auto takes it randomly around your space. It may seem like it covers the same ground a lot but it eventually gets to everything. The manual setting allows you to control the direction by using the arrows on the remote. Single room goes around the edges of a room with boosted power for about 20 minutes. I found this setting especially useful for my coffee table, which has a weird open grid base. And there is a circular setting for concentrating on an area in an increasingly larger spiral. You can set a start time or not for automatic cleaning times. You can stop and change modes when you want to. It is remarkably quieter than i expected. Eufy runs about 100 minutes and then returns to the charging base where it takes about 5 hours to recharge. My home has all hardwood floors except one closet where we have a thick sculptured area rug. It does a decent job on this carpet too, despite to sculptured fibers. I have the master suite and one bedroom used as an office closed off until i can get all the cords out if the way. We probably have about 2000 square feet on this level. My feeling is that i will need to run it a second time once i get these rooms open to really get everything so I can’t yet speak to that volume. This model does not empty itself but cleanup is simple. After the run is complete, its easy to dump the dust, remove the cloth filter then wash the foam filter and pre filter. I rinse out the container and then dry everything off by hand. Then i let everything air dry until its all completely dry, several hours, reassemble it and pop the container back in. Its been fun to watch my cats fascination with Eufy. They like to chase it and play with the “whiskers”. My male has figured out how to move it off the base by pushing the bumpers and then watch it as it re docks, chasing the whiskers as it does. They think it is the best cat toy ever. I just like having my floors sparkling clean all day! I highly recommend this Eufy model.","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2019"

B07R295MLS,5,nice at first,"Edited (10/22/19) and placed on top so others can see what has occurred since making the statements below~ Shortly after returning the robovac that was not working as intended the company made contact with me (they are very serious on having happy clients). They offered me a new robovac of the same model which I told them I had already returned and received a refund for. They stated they understood this yet would still like to send my a new one which I accepted after a few exchanged emails. This company went above and beyond much the same way I run my business. I learned a long time ago if your clients are not happy you can put your company at risk of failure. Now I don't know if they just sent my out a unit with a new battery or if there have been upgrades to said unit yet I will say this new one works like a charm. The only two issues I have every had since running this for about 3 weeks is it get stuck in two areas of my home however that is not of any fault or flaw to said unit. The areas are just that kind of area; one of the areas I simple moved the two throw rugs closer together and the unit stopped getting caught in the toe kick of the cabinet, the other is under a hide-a-bed when it is in use by getting caught on the loop leg whereas the unit get in a kind of see-saw predicament (this area I will be placing tape around the leg as a bumper so it will no longer be able to breach the area. Even with these two things being of no error to their manufacturing they had a suggestion that has worked for other (I was not interested in said suggestion because it seemed a bit ackward to me) and also sent my out a new brush for all the communication I have offered (they stated it helps them to make a better unit when they know what to look for) All in all I am very please with the unit; it runs strong and does what it is intended for. Great company to work with. (original comments) As an overall cleaning unit it did a fine job for it's price. It got the bulk of the dust and what nots off the carpet and floors of our home + family room in one 90 minute pass on it maiden voyage. It amazed me how much debris where on the floors for the first few mission of capture and destroy and such become less as time went on. I had it set so that it would go on after we left for work and the house always looked vacuum when we returned. I will forewarn anyone who purchased any of these type units that you must clean the brushes daily for about the first week, after that it was about about every few days for me yet I have long hair and a cat. Also the catch bin must be emptied daily (at least that was true for me) as well as a good cleaning of the filter in the catch bin to achieve maximum cleaning power. Because I already knew this it was not an issue for me. I was off work and heard the unit start and run for about 15 or so minuted then I no longer heard it so I got up to see if it got caught (which it had done on two occasions) or just at the back of the house. Nope, it had returned to it's base to recharge which under normal use should not of happened for 90 or so minuted. I thought perhaps my cat may of pushed it off it's charger so I charged up to a full charge and set it free again. Once again it ran for a short time then returned to it's base. I know from owning many battery operated tools that this is a sure sign of a worn out battery. Instead of opening the battery compartment to check the date on the battery (some battery tools are in the warehouse for long periods of time which means you get a worn out battery to start with) I decided for a new tool that this is unacceptable and returned said item. I will be looking at other brands to see if this is an issue before purchasing another. If it was not for the battery issue and the fact that the remote only worked when I was in the same room as the unit I would of been fully satisfied with the product and kept it even though the remote was limited. Again, this may of been a battery issue as the box came with batteries for the remote as well. Nice cleaning unit providing it stays charged.","Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2019"
B07R295MLS,5,Great purchase,"Very happy with purchase, does a fantastic job mopping floors daily, rotating mop heads, self cleaning to ensure mop heads are constantly rinsed and cleaned with fresh water, automatically emptying dirty water and debris separately","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Doubtful Thomas Served!,"I bought this for a Christmas present for my wife who mostly ends up doing most of the vacuuming in our home. She mentioned wanting a robovac and I was very doubtful it would actually cover the house in a way that would be even noticeable—and I am a high tech gadget guy but even this I honestly figured it was just a wasteful little gadget like a drone that would be used a few times and put in the closet. Wrong- It absolutely does the job. It is totally amazing to come home every day and see that your house has been vacuumed like someone came through with a regular vacuum. We have a dog that sheds and we used to come home and find clumps of hair collecting on the tile entry floors and all of that is gone now. Our carpets are all brushed up and beat like you would find with a standard vacuum and they are being cleaned every single day which is really great for extending the life of our carpet as well. Noticing a huge difference on how clean the carpets are. You will also be amazed how much stuff it sucks up off of your floor every day. Even after we vacuum the house with a regular vacuum it’s amazing the next day what other things it finds. Personally I think it does a better job than our regular vacuum and we have a Kirby vacuum. So that’s a little plug about these Robo vac’s if you were contemplating buying one I would highly recommend picking one that has the most suction capability and the model I chose which was the eufy 11S Max vacuums the whole house within an hour unattended. As for product feedback for the eufy 11S Max— there are some flaws that I assume our unit shares with others. 1. This unit tends to not have a particular coverage pattern. In our case our main footage of our house is relatively small around 2000 ft. And with all of the furniture and different things in the room a grid coverage is really not possible and what we find is it pretty much just vacuums the entire house during its cycle however it decides to do it. Hey it’s a robot you need to give it a little space and let it make its own choices right? I am sure it misses a few areas on a cycle but I can tell you by the look of the carpet when we get home it pretty much covers the whole house including under the beds and under dressers. Whatever it doesn’t catch on a daily cycle it likely catches the next day or eventually over a few days the entire house is getting covered completely and thoroughly. 2. Some people had complained about the unit not being able to find its way back to It’s homebase. We experience that same problem in fact we have a running joke when we get home and can see the vac not in its docking station we ask each other ‘have you found the robovac yet?’ To be honest with you it’s sort of funny, has a little character to it and doesn’t bother you. It typically gets wedged or stuck on things that are not well configured to have it’s low profile scuttling around the house. So you do need to configure your house over the first few weeks after seeing what hangs it up. It has a timeout feature so if it gets high centered or stuck somewhere it pretty much shuts down and it does have a locating button you can push much like a remote for your car. After about three weeks we have eliminated all of its hangups and now it is coming back to the base very regularly. So that’s it. I hope you enjoyed the review especially if you’ve been skeptical about these working because I am extremely skeptical about gimmicky products. I would highly recommend this product and I am looking forward to more household robot type items like this that can eliminate the mundane work we have to all do.

I set it to mop and vac on M-W-F and just vacuum on remaining days. I do get the alert that there is excess water in the mop wash tray because of the hair, but a quick empty takes care of that.

This new unit had some positive features, such as the ability with to use a remote. However, the first unit burned out after after a number of years, leading me to purchase a second one from the same company. Unfortunately, the second unit had problems with Wi-Fi and iPhone connectivity. Communication with the company’s tech support was challenging due to language barriers, and the vacuum only worked intermittently. Your unit. I realized that it wasn’t crucial for the vacuum to go in a straight line or connect to Wi-Fi. The vacuum still performed its cleaning duties effectively. Additionally, its shorter height allowed it to clean underneath furniture efficiently.","Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2024"

B07R295MLS,5,Don't get rid of your regular vacuum but prepare to use it A LOT less!,"I have waited a little while to make a review, and have had this about a month and a half. This is a total game-changer and I wish I would have got two! I gave this a 5 for hair, but it doesn't work that great for hair on carpet. I have a yellow lab and he gets hair alllllll over. It helps tremendously with his loose hair, even on the carpet, but you still have to vacuum it up occasionally. I used to vacuum everyday and it wouldn't look like it by the next day. Now I can go 2 wk and it's not terrible at all! It is so good at edging that it would be worth the purchase just for that alone. I rarely have to use my vacuum hose anymore. The battery life is great. It came with extra parts which I love. Tip: you can rotate the longer feeler brushes once they get bent. They will spring back in place if you let them sit for a few days. I also have two kids that are constantly spilling popcorn, cereal, dog and cat food, mud....all that. Now I can just turn on this vacuum and walk away. It has reduced my stress so much. I have never really thought about purchasing a robot vacuum because I love to vacuum and I love clean floors. Now I get to worry less about the condition of my floors and can mop even more since I spend so much less time vacuuming. I decided to go with this not only because of the price but because it did not have all the bells and whistles; I live in the country and do not have Wi-Fi so I have no use for all of that. I run this everyday and we'll move it from room to room in my house. I do not move the docking station each time though. I also have finally found a use for all the extra shoes that we have LOL. I use them to create a barrier in each room so the vacuum can get a good clean in each room as opposed to wandering about the house and not really cleaning each room as good as it can. So I did save some money by not purchasing the virtual barrier! This is a low profile vacuum, so you have to watch it because it will get itself underneath things, like my entertainment center and a couple of dressers, and get stuck. I can leave the house and not worry about it. It shuts off if something gets stuck in it and we'll go to its docking station once it's battery gets low. several times now my kids have spilled things on the floor right as we're getting ready to leave and instead of stressing about it I can just turn this on and head out the door. It is super easy to clean and it even comes with a little tool. the main brush on the bottom has little slots in it that the tool fits in to cut all the wrapped up hairs off of it. It picks up so much I still am shocked each time I empty it out. Our house is old and has some led paint remaining so it was recommended I vacuum more. This had relieved a lot of my anxieties about lead dust exposure. I also vacuumed almost every day so being told to vacuum more was very overwhelming. This vacuum is a serious game changer and I will be buying another. It is not extremely loud but you might have to turn up the volume on the TV for the kids a little bit. My two-year-old is still scared of it and doesn't like it getting close to her but she's really not that worried about it anymore. I'm disappointed my cats have not rode it yet LOL but they watch it and sometimes follow it from a distance lol. The only complaint that I really have about this is that it spends too long trying to go over things that it shouldn't. I have wide circular bases for my bar stools and it will climb up on them and continue to try to move about on top of it. I just wish it wouldn't spend so much time trying to get over things that it can't, if that makes sense. When it does get stuck on things it makes a irritating grinding noise because the brushes aren't spinning but they're trying to. Other than that one complaint this thing is perfect!","Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2020"

B07R295MLS,5,"Third Time's a Charm, or Three Times a Lady","I love this vacuum cleaner! It is the third robotic vacuum I’ve had and is by far my favorite. (I named her Hazel III after the maid in the old comic strip.) I can see why it’s the best-selling robotic vacuum on Amazon. One of the reasons I bought it is that I already have a Eufy rechargeable stick vacuum, which is also wonderful and well made. The other robotic vacs I had were an iRobot Roomba and a Roborock. Here are my reasons for loving Hazel III: 1. It’s very quiet. 2. It’s very lightweight. 3. It’s a lower height than the other vacuums so that it fits under more furniture than the others did. 4. It’s well made with quality parts and a nice finish. 5. It’s simple to figure out. 6. It’s easy to clean. The only thing that takes a bit of time is the main brush, since I have two long-haired cats and need to untangle their hair from the brush. However, the brush does not have small pieces on each end that fall into the wastebasket and need to be fished out when it’s being cleaned. Also, the parts fit back together easily after they’re cleaned. 7. It doesn’t give false signals, like telling me the filter and brush need to be cleaned when it really needs to be recharged. In fact, it doesn’t talk at all, which is refreshing for a change. 8. It’s very reasonably priced. 9. The remote and vacuum itself have legends on them to explain what the icons and the beeps mean. 10. Even though it only works for 90 minutes on standard suction and doesn’t then recharge and go out again, it seems to remember where it’s been and doesn’t always head off in the same direction. 11. Even though three feet of clearance is recommended for it to find the docking station, I wanted to put it in the knee hole of a kitchen cabinet desk, which doesn’t have three feet of clearance, but the vacuum often finds its way back, regardless. If it doesn’t, I just place it in front of the docking station, push the button, and it docks itself. 12. The manual is actually written in good, clear English, as opposed to a slipshod translation from Chinese, which is a very refreshing change. 13. I did put double-sided tape on the bottom of the charger unit so that it wouldn’t slide around on the floor when the vacuum was attempting to dock—no big deal. 14. I took advantage of the lightning deal and bought a second one. 15. Full disclosure, I've only had my first one a few weeks, but so far, so good. Update a couple weeks later: I recant #10. Hazel III didn't travel to the ""west wing"" of my long, ranch-style house as well as I thought she did, so I will station Hazel IV in the other end of the house so the house will get better coverage.","Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2024"

B07R295MLS,5,"fantastic nimble device , this is a steal , love it","I would also call myself a ROOMBA veteran like another reviewer did, and I think my first ROOMBA was possibly at 300 pet series and then I had a 600 pet series for at least 10 years. I did not realize how dysfunctional it had become, because I had an excellent house cleaner. Long story short, the housecleaner went on a prolonged vacation, and I found myself realizing that I had a dinosaur as a ROOMBA and needed an urgent replacement. Being used to the old ROOMBAs, I was not familiar with all the fancy new options, like you get a bigger dustbin or that they map your house or you get a remote control, and I gave it a long thought but I really did not feel I needed that. I have a rather small house, and random cleaning pattern has always worked well for me. But what I needed was a robot that can navigate under furniture that sits a little lower without getting stuck underneath it all the time, and can navigate up and down flat carpets without turning them over all the time and getting stuck. Also, I should mention I have 2 cats. And this little device fits that bill, it cleans extremely well, navigates around and under all my furniture without problems, and is also so quiet compared to my old ROOMBA and it 'bumps into furniture very gently and quietly. What was a surprise is, that it must have a different sensing mechanism compared to ROOMBA, so the EUFY tried vehemently to get into our gas fireplace dragging all the little stones out of it -some decorative larger stones out of my garden, placed as a barrier, fixed that problem. And it can't sense stairs if the edges leading down to them are wood and very smooth: I had to learn that the hard way, the first time EUFY tumbled down I thought my cats had pushed it, the second time I actually pulled out the instruction manual and read it, and there it warns you about the smooth wood edges ...lol. But I have to say, EUFY took both tumbles with grace, and now my laundry hamper serves as an obstacle if I use Eufy on the second floor. And yes, of course, it cleans very well, it is always full of debris no matter how long or short I keep it running and the dustbin is easy to clean and the brushes also seem to be less of a hassle compared to the old ROOMBA ones. EUFY is a steal for that price [ I bought it for about $120 !!] I would get a second one if I had a bigger house. But it is also so lightweight, I can carry it upstairs easily if needed. I cannot say anything about the remote, I have not used it. I am tired of every little device you buy these days coming with its own remote, I have a whole collection of it, and nobody can ever remember what device they belonged to. And my cats: well, funnily it seems they disliked the loud and clumsy old Dinosaur ROOMBA much less than the stealthy EUFY. Go and figure. They go to a different floor when EUFY is doing its work, and ROOMBA they used to watch curiously from some high point.","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2023"
B07R295MLS,5,Perfect for every day clean!,"For background, The main reason I started looking into an automatic vacuum was for pet hair and litter! I have 3 cats and it's a constant battle to keep the floors clean and the house fresh. In order to keep the floors looking okay, I needed to sweep at least twice per day, but since I hate sweeping I rarely even did it once a day. I started to look into vacuums and this one rated highly on vacuum wars (a YouTube channel I highly recommend if you're doing any kind of vacuum shopping!) and was also in my price range. I feel like for the price, I couldn't ask for any better. I work from home, so I don't need any fancy app or anything like that. I also didn't care for Just something fairly quiet and effective that I can run 1-3x per day and will keep the floors clean without actually having to do anything but pick up and press a button lol. I usually run it once in the morning, once before bed, and sometimes once in the afternoon but really only if I feel like it. It does a really good job at picking up litter, cat hair, and crumbs. The house looks, smells, and feels much cleaner! I think it was well worth the price, and replacement parts are affordable if needed down the line. Pros: -Fair Price point - quiet enough that I can run it while my daughter is sleeping, or while I'm working and it's not distracting - cats don't mind it, they were suspicious at first but accepted it as part of the family within an hour - good at picking up litter, cat hair, and is able to get in and around most places in my home - It's easy to empty, I usually do it every day or 2, even though it's not completely full Cons: - Like most of these automatic vacuums, you probably need to do a deep clean once a week or every 2 weeks, using a regular vacuum/ mop. If you didn't it would still be way cleaner than doing nothing at all. For my hard floor, really the mopping is what needs to be done periodically. -It does get stuck sometimes. Particularly under this one low drawer. Since I only run it when I'm home I just have to go get it if I hear it beeping, not a big deal for my situation. - The cleaning is randomized so sometimes it misses certain spots or gets one room more thoroughly than another room. You have to be mindful of picking things up and shutting doors where you don't want it to go - sometimes it disconnects from the charger, I'm not sure if my cats knock it out of place or what, but it can be a bummer if I was planning on running it and it needs to be charged (which takes an hour or 2) - Sometimes it can find it's way back to the charger, sometimes it dies before it can figure it out. Again, not a huge deal since I'm around, but something to take into account if you plan to run it while you're out. Bottom line it's overall not as ""smart"" as the more expensive models, but I feel that's a given. It works perfectly for my situation, and I would buy it again and recommend it for most work at home households","Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2023"

B07R295MLS,5,Best purchase ever! Especially since I no longer have to vacuum anymore!,"Pros: 1. So very quiet 2. Low profile, fits under coffee table 3. Actually keeps the floor clean 4. Amazing price Cons: 1. Occasionally gets stuck, results in a game of hide and seek 2. No way to keep it in a ""zone"" Summary: I'm very glad that we decided to buy this vacuum. We used to have a Roomba, but got rid of it a while ago when the battery finally tired out and the cost to replace it was ridiculous. But we missed having something vacuum for us. We were looking at a refurbished Roomba (at still another $80 more than what we paid for this new vacuum) when I read the reviews about the Eufy and thought I'd give it a chance, especially after reading about how quiet this unit is. And truly, it is a very quiet vacuum, yet with amazing vacuum power. It's so quiet that I run it at nighttime, and have it programmed to run at midnight every night, and it bothers nobody. Keep in mind I have two young kids, of which one is a very light sleeper, and this vacuum is so quiet that it doesn't wake up anyone. The only thing that's loud about the vacuum is when it runs into a table leg with a loud BONK because the IR sensor can't sense thin things like that in the way. I'm sure that there's some AI programming in the vacuum, but you couldn't really tell from just watching it. If you're familiar with a Roomba, this Eufy does the exact same thing: appears to senselessly wander around the house in random patterns. It's as if you got a toddler drunk and then asked him to vacuum your living room. Yet amazingly, when you open up the dustbin there's a ton of stuff it has picked up. After running it about 3 days in a row, it has pretty much vacuumed up the entire floor and the floors are visibly cleaner. It even picks up the stuff along the baseboards and in corners. It's actually quite amazing how much lint and stuff the vacuum picks up. And with two young kids in the house who constantly generate crumbs and random lost goldfish crackers, running this vacuum every night has nearly eliminated my need to pull out the upright vacuum. The vacuum finds its way to the charging port about 90% of the time. When it doesn't I've found that it got stuck someplace and ran out of battery power. Unlike the Roomba that will play a sad song intermittently so you can find it when it gets stuck, the Eufy just dies. So then you're wandering around your house looking for the darn thing. If there's any improvements to the future model, I wish that it would give out the distress signal so finding it won't be so annoying. The dustbin is easy to empty, and has 3 air filters to keep the lint and dust in the dustbin and prevent the vacuum from just blowing out dusty air out of the exhaust port. So far, I've been simply brushing out the filters about once a week, but I can see how I will probably need to replace it in a few more months. (I've had this unit for about 2 months now). Thankfully the filters are available to purchase separately and not too expensive. The two spinning brushes have also held up well. The roller brush gets clogged with hair, but the whole thing pops out easily for cleaning. The Eufy even comes with a cleaning tool/brush that makes it easy to clean the roller brush and the dust bin. Overall, cleaning the unit and maintaining it isn't all that labor intensive or difficult. The one aggravating thing about the Eufy is that there is no way to keep it out of certain areas or rooms without creating a physical barrier. The one nice thing about the Roomba was that I could set out virtual walls. With the Eufy, I'm physically placing things in the way. Not a deal breaker, just another little thing that I wish could be improved. We have dark hardwood floors and I was afraid that the vacuum couldn't distinguish the edge of the floor by the stairs and that it would tumble down the stairs, especially at night, but the IR sensors do a great job and that hasn't been a problem. I'm so happy with this that I'm buying a second one to keep on the second floor. The cost of two of these is still less than one new Roomba. Overall I'm very glad that I decided to take a chance on the Eufy because it's everything the Roomba offers at a fraction of the cost and a fraction of the noise!","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2018"
B07R295MLS,5,Great product with amazing customer support!,"So I recently had a very nice, expensive vacuum die and since we have been getting rid of wall to wall carpet and putting in hard surface flooring (combo of wood, vinyl plank and tile with area rugs) I really wasn't sure I needed a new vacuum with all the features my old one had AND with 3 dogs and 3 kids I really loved the idea of not having to nag a kid or vacuum myself...in full honest it was never done enough anyway! I decided to get an inexpensive upright vacuum and splurge on this and I couldn't be happier even though their was a problem right out of the box. So, full disclosure: I did buy the ""like new, not in original box"" one from Amazon for a nice discount and had it delivered with a part missing. I reached out to Amazon who told me they couldn't help and that I needed to ask the company directly. I was honestly a bit worried I was going to end up with a vacuum I would have to return and then be left with having to fork out over $60 more to replace it. I, however, was very pleasantly surprised when I got not only a $30 credit from Amazon for my troubles but I also had some amazing customer service from Anker. I contacted them directly asking if I could get the missing part (was missing the axle that held the swivel ball that helps to steer the vacuum). I fully expected they would either not respond or tell me that that wasn't an available part...totally wrong. We got ahold of them quickly, exchanged a few emails to explain the issue and just as quickly got a shipping label to return the vacuum. Less than a week later I had a brand new, in the box waiting on my door step! As for how this works...it's pretty amazing for how little it is! Besides the dogs and their hair and crud they track in we have tons of foot traffic in and outside. I don't have this run on a schedule since one of my worst fears is becoming one of the horror stories I've read about where someone is close to burning there home down after their robo-vac has spread a dog mess. So about 3-4 times a week I do a quick house patrol for doggie drool and potential puddles (thank you 15 yo pup who can't hold it as well as she use to) and let this sucker run around and do it's thing. Pro's: I'm not doing the work, it can fit under furniture that a regular vac can't, it's not as loud as a regular vacuum, it gets the littles to try beat it to their room before it might suck up a barbie shoe or lego and it also gives one of my lazy dogs the motivation to get moving when he sees it coming. Another bonus is it gave me the motivation to unravel the giant mess of cords that always bothered me under my entertainment center since it would get hung up under there. Con's: Can't say there are many that weren't expected. The dust bin is small and the beater brush is too so you need to keep an eye on that but heck, I have four long-haired people and three dogs in my home and its small size allows it to go under places that I would have typically used a dust mop to reach. It doesn't always get everything and obviously it has the limits of it's maneuverability around things like the dinner table and the chair legs BUT I didn't expect it to replace the need for periodic vacuuming by an actual person who is moving things and can see where more attention is needed. I've now been using this for a few weeks and am very happy and also have the confidence that the company will stand behind their product.

We have used it nearly everyday and now I can't imagine going back to manually vacuuming everyday. I have to cut hair build up off the roller bar about every 3 months and I'd say the roller needs replaced every 6-8 months. I just replace the air filter whenever I replace the roller and replace the three-pronged brushes on the front whenever the bristles start to look frayed or broken. The replacement parts aren't expensive and are really easy to change out. Original: We have hardwood and tile throughout our house with a high-pile rug in one room. We also have lots of plants and two cats who seems to shed year round. Before we purchased this robovacuum our floors were regularly covered in fallen fern leaves, cat food crumbs, hair both human and feline, scattered cat litter, and whatever other debris has gotten tracked in. It does great on our our hard floors. I wasn't expecting it to be able to traverse the rug without getting stuck because its basically shag and has fringe tassels on two sides, but it seems to do just fine moving around. It doesn't get everything out of the rug fibers but it gets a lot. I wouldn't say that this is a great product for deep cleaning your floors, but it is great for daily maintenance of your floors. We purchased this a little over 3 weeks ago and have been using it 4-5 times a week. I have to empty it every time we run it because it picks up a surprising amount. Now I just use my dyson to deep clean the rug and high traffic areas once a week. I love that I don't have to regularly pull out furniture to get all the dust bunnies that build up underneath. Someone visiting my home, knowing that we've got pets, would probably assume that I spend hours vacuuming based on how clean the floors are on any given day, when in reality I'm spending an hour or less per week. It allows me to be more productive and dedicate more time to self-care. That alone is worth the cost of this product, imo. Some specific notes: 1) It's pretty good about not eating cords but will sometimes get stuck on them. When a cord does get stuck, its always been easy to unwrap and the cord isn't damaged. 2) It's good at not running off of ledges. We leave the basement door open so our cats can access their litter box and it goes right up to the edge without going over. 3) If you have carpet throughout your house, you may not have the same experience as it seems to do a fine job on carpet, but does a great job on hard floors. 4) It doesn't always find its dock right away when it needs to charge but I don't mind it wandering around for a few extra minutes so this hasn't been an issue for me. 5) After a few weeks I am starting to see my long-haired cat's fur build up around the roller bar so I will probably need to plan to cut that off the roller every couple of months with how frequently I use it. Over all, I highly recommend this product. It is a great value for daily cleaning and saves me time.","Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2023"
B07R295MLS,5,Eufy is a 10 and iRobot (Roomba) is a 4,"We have had a Roomba (600 Series)for a few years and bought this Eufy last year ; there is no comparison, but I'll try to rate them on features that might be important to all: 1) Noise: Eufy is quiet and you can run it on an even lower, less powerful (and quieter) speed. Roomba is so loud that you can't have a conversation in the same room and you're aware of it in other rooms. 2) Delicacy: Eufy can be programmed to continue into the edges/borders but even when it does, it does so delicately. Roomba throws itself boldly into every structure so all of my white moldings are now marred. It also once turned the key on my gas fireplace and my house was full of gas when I arrived home. It's my fault for leaving the key in, but Eufy would not power into it hard enough to turn it. Good thing I'm not smoker! 3a) Cleaning the machine: Eufy: comes with a tool to help clean off the dust, rip out the hair from the brush, and clean the brush ends. Roomba: Prior to owing the Eufy, I didn't think to expect a cleaning tool. I figured out that I needed a special kind of gadget to remove the hair (long hair from human heads, not from pets) from the brush and purchased a long-handled seam ripper which was perfect. Why didn't they include a cleaning tool? 3b) Cleaning your floors/rugs: Eufy has two rotating brushes made of a substance that does not wear out. They also send along extra brushes in case you need them! It picks up twice as much gunk as the Roomba. Roomba (my model) has one brush which would break/lose its bristles very quickly and need to be replaced at a high cost. 4) Price - compare them. Eufy comes in at half the price of some of the Roomba models. In this case, more expensive is not better (in fairness, my Roomba is at least 4 years old, and perhaps they've improved since my model). 5)) Customer service: Eufy - ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING! Easy to reach, understandable and there to please the customer. Two examples: Eufy #1 (named Alfred) seemed to get noisier and noisier. I thought it might be my imagination, but the account rep asked me to hold the phone up to Alfred and she listened and stated the noise was from a faulty motor. Since Alfred was still under warranty, they sent me a replacement! Replacement (named James) seemed to not be cleaning well (it was running, but leaving crumbs behind). We discovered that both brushes has come off and oddly, have never found them. Figuring this was an oddity, we popped on two more (which had come with James) and they fell off quickly too. This had never happened with Alfred. I called customer service and they had not heard of this before. Dave, the account rep who helped me, really took time to try to think through a solution. At first, Dave was going to send me more brushes but then he said that this was just a ""band aid"" and he wanted to find a better/longer- term solution. James was two days out of warranty and guess what they did? They are sending me another new machine and asking me to send back James so they can learn what the problem is. Eufy Bonus: Eufy comes with a remote control (and extra brushes and filers), so you send it to a specific spot if needed. Roomba bonus - two features I like on the Roomba that my Eufy does not have: one - it has a handle that makes it easy to pick up (a minor, but nice feature) and two - you can program each day for a different time or to not run at all. My Eufy is all or nothing (same time every day). I have recommend Eufy to everyone I can and many of my friends have purchased and have had not trouble at all and if they do, I know Dave and his colleagues will do the right thing!","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2020"
B07R295MLS,5,It works and it works well!,"I needed to replace my aging Neoto which only runs for about 10 min before it needs to recharged at this point. To its credit the Neoto worked well for 4 years. But I wanted a new robovac for the upstairs instead of replacing the NiCad battery in the Neoto. After doing some research I kept seeing the Eufy ranked in pretty much every top 5 list I looked at. The price was right so I figured I'd give it a shot and wow am I impressed. Most of my house is hardwood but I have two bedrooms that have carpet. The best way to do this is to compare the Neoto to the Eufy. Price: The Neoto was $700 when I bought it in 2015. The Eufy was $150. (you get what you pay for right? Just keep reading) Design: Neoto has a flat front and a rounded back which makes it better for cleaning corners and edges. The Eufy is round but it does have whiskers to push dirt and hair from the wall and into the robovac's path. I thought they both did about the same cleaning corners and edges. The Eufy is also extremely thin which gives it the ability to go underneath furniture. Navigation: I was hesitant about the random bump style cleaning method of the Eufy. People call the Eufy a dumb robovac and that's accurate. The Neoto has laser mapping abilities and you would think the Neoto would win this category. You would be wrong. Yes, the Neoto had a better cleaning pattern out of the gate. It would find a wall and hug it for a while then it would do a crisscross pattern around the room. The Eufy shoots out of its base and proceeds to go in a random direction. It has no pattern to it. However, after an hour I noticed that the Eufy had been in every room and the spots where the dog hair (I have a lab) had piled up was clean of all fur. And to my surprise, the Eufy never got stuck and it returned itself back to the charging base. In contrast, the Neoto would almost always get stuck. It would either get lost in my bedroom or get stuck under the dining room chairs (Neoto's worst nemesis). Also, the Eufy cleaned for almost 90min which is about twice as long as my Neoto ever cleaned. Both avoided the stairs with ease. Winner: Eufy Noise level: The Eufy is quiet! I mean its really, really quiet. I literally forgot it was cleaning while watching TV. Unless it's underneath you I doubt you would even notice its running. The Neoto on the other hand is loud. This was a pleasant surprise. Winner: Eufy Cleaning ability: The Neoto has better suction there is no question about that. But 95% of the mess on my floors is dog hair. The first time I used the Eufy I was irritated to see clumps of dog hair being run over and spit out the back. So I checked the bin and it was PACKED full. I cleaned out the bin and there was no more dog hair being left behind. One thing to note is that Eufy never let me know that the bin was full (the Neoto does). Its also worth noting that the bin on the Eufy is twice the size of the one in my Neoto. Winner: Its a push on hardwood floors. Neoto wins on carpet. Tech Features: The Eufy is bare bones when it comes to tech features. There is no phone app or Alexa capabilities but the Eufy does come with a remote that works just fine. All I wanted was the ability to program an auto schedule which the Eufy has so I'm good with it. The Neoto has all the bells and whistles. None of which I used. There is one feature the Eufy has that I really like. You can use the remote to manually control where the Eufy goes using the directional pad. I immediately used it to chase my dog around the house lol. After I got bored I put it back on auto mode and let it do its thing. In summary, I'm beyond impressed with the Eufy. It either holds par or exceeds the abilities of my much more expensive Neoto. The Eufy might be dumb but it's effective and it works. I was worried about it falling down the stairs but the drop sensors did the job. It still hasn't gotten stuck and I get to come home to clean floors. This robovac is best used for what I call maintenance cleaning. If you have pets that shed this is a must buy.","Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2019"
B07R295MLS,5,Very Budget solution. A few notes,"Play Video 2/14/2020:. I want to give a shout out to eufy for their stellar customer service. They reached out to me after I returned my purchase and expressed their concern that my experience wasn't totally positive. They offered me a free eufy upright. I accepted their offer and they sent it within a week. (It's a great vacuum. Good for stairs). Not only that but they reached out to me again a few days after I received my vacuum to check on me and ask how my experience was. I am so impressed with their customer service. Beyond impressed. I will definitely be looking at eufy for future purchases maybe even an upgrade sometime. I'm also going to put back all their stars and let it be known that they did not solicit me in anyway to write this or give a five star rating. They really deserve it I think. 1/19/2020: Okay all. I mentioned in my first review that I was doing research. Well i've done my homework and there are better options out there for the same price. The 11S isn't a bad vac at all for a small space. It's a great little vacuum but the navigation is really a deal breaker for me. I took it to my sisters house to show it off and it really cleans well. Took it to my moms house to show it off and it picked up so much dog hair (my mom is ready to kill the dog for how much it sheds) but that navigation thing is terrible. It cleans the same places over and over again and barely touches others. I'm never certain of what has been cleaned and what hasn't. I'm going to be returning my purchase. I hope Eufy really works on their navigation. Honestly its the only thing this little guy is missing. Update 2: okay note to all. Eufy doesn't like sunlight. Weird right? I have a bay window on my kitchen and my Eufy treats the light on the floor as a barrier. Sometimes this can cause it to get stuck and cry out for help. Also, the reverse function isn't that hot. it doesn't like to go backwards and only goes a short distance before stopping. sometimes it just won't move at all. Not very impressed by this little oddity removed another star for having to rescue my Eufy from nothing. Attached a video this time to show you all. Very sad about this, I was so excited for my Eufy. Update: Navigation really needs work. Honestly the bumper/sensor system is very good and functional. But the degrees of rotation that the vacuum chooses when it encounters an obstacle are nonsensical. Auto should work by doing the edges first and then when it reaches the base again proceed cleaning the greater area in parallel paths using the bumpers to navigate around objects in the parallel path. Removed one star for it. ORIGINAL: So after I bought this I started doing some research....i know it's backwards.... And found that this particular model is actually highly rated for it performance despite its low cost. I've run it three times in the luast couple days. It's amazing how much dirt they're was and fur from the kitties. Now the fir does get trapped in the roller brush quite easily but it also cleans fairly easily I think. It does really get under everything m under the lip of the fridge and the cabinets, under the couches, the side tables and the front every table. It maneuvers around objects pretty well. If it's in a complicated area like under a four legged table with chairs all around it can take a second to get to everything and it's not going to be all at once. I think on a full charge it hit everything about four times. First floor of a 1300 sqft townhome. If I was doing it again the only thing I would change is to get a unit that maps the area. Otherwise it's the most silent of all the robovacs and that's a huge plus. Not a bad purchase by any means but could use just a little leg up. Also area rugs might cause a problem if the edges lift up easily. The brushes tend to slip right under the rug and rolls it up under the vacuum. It usually makes it over the mountain just fine but not without some difficulty. Never had it get stuck.","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2020"
B07R295MLS,5,WOW! Better than the expensive i-branded one I had!,"I knew this was supposedly a ""step down"" from the more well-known brand of robotic vac I had before but decided to take a chance. I wouldn't have made a change but the dust bin of my old one went missing when I took it out to clean and let it dry. I emailed customer service and that was a joke. ""Don't worry, we'll solve this together."" Next sentence ""Sorry there are no replacement parts available."" Hey, thanks for not helping solve this. I went to Costco and got that same brand as I had in a more updated version (organized cleaning pattern, not random) but the bottom of the dust bin was broken. So I exchanged it for a different one, the same model. I thought, ""unexpected purchase but, what can I do? I have 3 dogs!"" Well, the 2nd one from Costco would not find our wireless, (which I had heard about that being a problem). It wouldn't connect no matter what - even to a temporary roomba connection. My husband was as frustrated as I, he detests going to Costco. So one more trip to return that defective one and we didn't try again. I can tell you that the i-4 was much cheaper looking that my old roomba, an 891. And what does it say about them that I had 2 in a row that had quality issues? So I started researching things. My DIL has the eufy and seems happy enough with it, so when I saw a video of this model, I watched it and was pretty impressed. It is much less random in its ""randomness"" that the i-robot that I had. And we have a small house pretty full of furniture and rugs, so I can't picture how a robotic vac that works in rows would even function in our house. So I ordered this eufy. And I am so glad I did! I like that: *This model was less expensive than the other brand! I got a protection plan and still spent SO much less than I would have on an that other brand *There is no app to deal with (You might think an app is a plus but it can be annoying.) *I know there is a newer model available but I like this one with a remote. (I have to make sure my 2YO grandson doesn't hide it tho) *You can tell it to edge clean and it gets all those little villages of dog hair. So satisfying to watch! *The quality of the unit is better than the roomba *It's SO quiet! I forget about it and it's back at the home base like a good doobie *It does not eat my rugs like the roomba, that thing was the WORST - so frustrating. It made holes in them and wrecked more than one rug. The eufy goes over them and has a BOOST mode to deal with them. I have all tile floors with rugs at entryways, under the dining table, and under the coffee table. *As noted above, this model has different modes. Note: The eufy if not as tall as my last one and both of them get stuck under furniture. So that's a wash. But at least the eufy is not annoying like that other brand when it gets stuck. And one of the brushes fell off a few times when I first got it, but it's good now. Thanks for reading. I don't think I've ever written a review this long.","Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2022"

B07R295MLS,5,Does a good to very good job on various floor surfaces (updated),"Model 11S Arrived a week or so ago. Used half a dozen times so far. Nicknamed it “bob” for bob n’ weave. It may not be too smart but has worked really well so far. Us - 2 adults, one dog & one cat. Bob has access to 1200 square feet of a single level house, 35% hardwood, 35% laminate & the rest dense plush carpet in one room. We have never run it on a timed start. Runs quiet enough you can be in the same room watching television while it works. We pick up pet beds, foot stools and move chairs out from under a dining table to give it easier unobstructed access. Absolutely amazed at the small spaces it can access. It was maybe designed by someone thinking of Star Trek because it certainly goes where no vacuum has gone before. After the first effort on the whole house, it really packed in the dirt, hair, cat litter and stuff that is indescribable. On subsequent regular uses, less in the collection box than the first round. It probably doesn’t deep clean carpet like an upright vacuum we would otherwise use, but it does a good to very good job on our variety of surfaces and cleans areas we would miss, owing to having to move a lot of furniture to get to them with an upright. So far it has been willing to run the promised 100 minutes. When confined to the hard floor only, it ran a surprising uninterrupted 120 minutes. It NEVER finds its way home to the charger when it runs out of battery, if that matters. It doesn’t to us because you ALWAYS need to clean out the collection container so you have to handle it after each use anyway. What we have decided works best is to limit bob to a smaller set of rooms or the carpeted room for about 90 minutes each use. That divides the house into about three areas. With the simple random pattern it uses, that seems to give total coverage in each area. A chair turned on its side in a doorway keeps it confined and still working. That’s why we don’t use the timed start. That gets the entire house about every three days. On the not too smart part, it may go into a space under a chair or cabinet that is really surprising it can access and, as a result of having difficulty finding its way out, it may be in that space for a long time. The good news is that difficult to access area should be well vacuumed! It always gets out eventually. For the price, bob seems to work well and fulfills its intended purpose. This is our first experience with a robot vacuum so maybe spending more money would get us something we don’t know about. It’s hard to think what that would be. So far, we are quite pleased. If things go bad, we’ll provide an update. Update after one month. Biggest change is bob now regularly finds its way back to the charging base from anywhere in the house if its path is not blocked. It must have figured something out! It gets run at least once a day and the best use continues to have it do about 1/3 of the house per day. Still excellent collection ability. Figured out that it is clearly easiest to clean the brush by removing it from the unit. The brush only needs to be cleaned after use on carpet. It seems to really pull the hair (pet & human) from there and hold it in the brush. The unit still runs well beyond the promised 100 minutes per use. No regrets here, but if purchased again would opt for the 30C with the included boundary strips and its sensors. Still very positive on this tool.","Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2020"
B07R295MLS,5,Well thought out and built,"Review after 3 days of daily operation (December 18, 2018) Overall: It keeps our hardwood, linoleum, and low-pile carpets clean and is very handy for keeping up with daily and weekly cleaning when a baby is preventing you from dedicating time for ""normal"" vacuuming. Is it quiet? Yes, it is. It is about as loud as a small fan. The noise spectrum is ""red"" (more bass than treble), making it mellow and comfortable to listen to. Interestingly it is actually slightly louder when it runs in an upstairs room and rumbles through the floor, but even that is never an issue. Does it get stuck? Not very often. When we first tried it we just let it loose in the house and noted what it could and couldn't handle. It did carpet transitions, chair legs, and most obstacles just fine. So far it has gotten stuck a total of 8 times. 1. paper towel caught in wheel 2. small rag in beater 3. loose piece of twine in wheel and sweeper 4. loose bit of twine in beater 5. wire rack on the floor 6. wedged in space between toilet and bathtub 7. wedged under sofa 8. Front wheel caught in pocket of sloping base for portable fan. In all these cases, the Eufy attempted to get unstuck for 15-20 seconds but finally ceased struggling and beeped for assistance, which in my opinion is a smart thing to do if you are a small robot who needs to retain enough battery power to complete the cleaning run after getting unstuck. After we removed the sticking items and put a garbage pail between the toilet and bathtub, it hasn't got stuck since. Does it effectively clean? Yes, it cleans hardwood floors beautifully as well as short and medium pile carpet. Keep in mind that mostly it cleans by sweeping with the brushes and beaters, the suction is more of an assist than the main cleaning force. Thus it does not pick up deeply seated particles in thick carpet very well. Returning to charge station: From observation it appears that the homing feature is basically an infrared beacon on the charging base. When the bot runs low on battery it shuts off the beater and suction and continues to bounce about the house until it is within eye-shot of the charging base, at which time it homes in on it. This system works pretty well, it just might take a few minutes of aimless wandering if your house is extensive or labyrinthine. Making sure the charging base commands a large field of view will definitely decrease the time required by the bot to find it. The bot likes to have at least 4ft of clear floor in front of the station so it can line up on it for docking. It'll usually do fine with 3 or even 2 feet, but has a tendency to get misaligned more and have to try again to dock successfully. Also, the bot seems to avoid cleaning within 3 feet of the station, possibly to avoid bumping it unintentionally or perhaps just because in cleaning mode the infrared beacon tricks the bots sensors into thinking there is an obstruction. Cleaning patterns: It appears to do a random bounce pattern alternating with a follow-the edge pattern to clean. Added to this is the infrared and bumper collision avoidance and cliff detection. This cleaning system does not ""learn"" a house and I doubt it changes its basic algorithm from run to run but nonetheless it cleans complicated areas quite effectively. I doubt any mapping bot could do any better, they'd just look more professional while doing it. Maintenance: The sweepers and beater collect long hair (over 3 inches) and need to be cleared after every run (unless your wife doesn't lose much hair. :) ) However this is pretty easy since the sweepers and beater come off easily and seem to be designed to avoid getting hair wrapped around their axles. There is even a little groove on each end of the beater to allow a knife to be inserted to cut off the wrapped up hair. Haven't had to clean the filter or wheels yet, but when the time comes I doubt it will be hard. Will have to see how it fares after a few months or a year.","Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2018"
B07R295MLS,5,Huge time saver!,"The short read: I have 2 Siberian Huskies, and this robot is a life saver!! Is it perfect? No. Does it capture 90% and save me a boatload of time at a reasonable price? Absolutely! Usage: I’ve had my Eufy (we call “Mo” from WALL-E) for about 3 weeks, running 1-2 times a day to keep up with the Husky fur. I empty the bin after each cleaning and use the brush to clean the outer filter. This is my first robot vacuum and I am very happy thus far. Suction: Usually cleans crumbs on first pass. Husky fur from low-pile carpet can take around 5 passes. In certain sections I will manually direct to be sure it gets enough passes on areas with higher fur levels (or higher visibility like my black rug). Dark Rugs: I have a large rug that is mostly black and 50% of the time she wouldn’t have any problems. But too frequently Mo would “freak out” and get stuck in a corner. Also didn’t like the clear plastic chair mat. Since it’s only cleaning my first floor, I fully fixed the issue by covering the 3 drop sensors. If the tape or covering is in direct contact with the sensors, it tends to fault that the sensors are dirty and won’t operate. But if you offset heavy, light-colored paper, it does the trick. Be sure that the bumpers can fully compress without hitting the paper. See the photos. Noise: Not as quiet as I was expecting but it’s a sacrifice for cleaner carpets, and probably standard for most robot vacuums. Durability: The basement door was briefly left open, and without active drop sensors, Mo took a nasty spill. I heard several large crashes, and found her upside down on the concrete basement floor, still running! A few scrapes, but doesn’t appear to have affected functionality. “Rogue” mode: I don’t use the scheduled cleaning because I like to be home when she’s operating so I can help if she’s in distress. About 2 weeks in, she started going rogue and operating sometime overnight without warning! In the morning we’d find area rugs shifted, and sometimes she’d be stuck somewhere. I called Eufy customer service and was told to remove the vacuum from the base, press and hold the scheduling button on the remote (has a small clock in front of a piece of paper) until I heard two beeps. So far this has cleared the “phantom” schedule in the remote. Ledges: We have a significant threshold to our kitchen flooring. It’s chamfered down to a half inch at the leading edge but at full thickness is 3/4 of an inch tall. Sometimes she gets stuck when headed straight for it, and does better at a slight angle. I’m happy she can manage it at all! Rug transitions: We only have low-pile rugs on our pine floors, all with low non-slip pads underneath. All rugs were rolled (online purchases) and even though I’ve ironed them and consider them reasonably flat, a side brush can get stuck. She does fairly well unless she’s at an angle that encourages one of the side brushes to get caught underneath the rug, or at a corner. When this happens, rugs that aren’t anchored with furniture can end up shifted, sometimes several feet! Rugs that are anchored with furniture won’t move, but she’ll spend a little extra time getting unstuck, and this can cause more rug curling and the edges to fray due to excess roller activity. These little issues aren’t bothersome to me. If you have expensive or slightly wrinkled rugs, you may want to do some tests or look elsewhere. Returning to base: I usually let Mo run for 30-60 minutes then pick her up to return to the station. The few times I let her go to low battery, she has found the base. But if the battery is low and cleaning has stopped, I’d prefer to just stop the noise :) Conclusion: For spending $200, I couldn’t be happier!","Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2019"
B07R295MLS,5,Best Decision We Ever Made Buying This,"We weren't in the market for a robot vacuum until one day a story popped up on my phone that there was a sale going on and this was an excellent choice. I did some investigating and it looked like a solid performer, neither I nor my wife are fans of sweeping and vacuuming, so it looked like a good option. We absolutely love this little thing! I'm sitting at my computer sipping a cappuccino while our RoboVac is whirring away keeping our whole house clean. Upside- it's so easy and does such a good job. It does get itself stuck occasionally, usually by wedging under a dresser front, but it beeps for a rescuer and shuts down to wait. We've been running it for about ten days now and it gathers a large amount of dirt and dust every day. It is slim enough that it easily gets underneath all the beds and most of the sofas and chairs, places that our upright vac couldn't get to. Some reviewers have stated that this works best in an apartment or small house; our house is single story, about 2300 square feet and it makes it around everywhere. I did choose a central location to put the base, so when it's time for the vac to go beddy-bye it doesn't have much trouble finding its way home. Run time has been excellent, we have mostly hardwoods with a few area rugs and it usually runs a full 100 minutes. We let it run a daily schedule and it always starts right on time. Being that this is a ""dumb"" robot vac, it will cover some areas three or four times while missing others, yesterday it completely missed two bedrooms. By running every day it eventually gets all the floor. For another several hundred dollars you can get a better programmed vac, but we like this one. I've been amazed at how well it figures out how to get out of the jams it gets itself into; just as I'm about to rescue it the RoboVac comes up with a new move and usually gets free. There is one thing I'd point out- the instructions say you can wash the dust receptacle after removing the filters . . yes you can, but water gets trapped inside the double layer plastic lid. I pulled the rubber plugs out and unscrewed the top panel to get it dried out, I won't do that again. Wipe it out with a damp cloth and let it be. Now if we only had a robot that did the dusting . . .","Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2018"
B07R295MLS,5,Elegant design and mopping significantly better than most,"I have gone through various robo vacuums including the most recent being the Roborock Q7+ Max. This new Eufy C20 was roughly the same price but the mopping ability is significantly better. The app and ability to map the house on multiple floors is great. I enjoy seeing where the vacuum is when I'm out of the house and being able to see what action it is currently performing. The battery could be slightly better but it is smart enough to return to the base when it's low, avoiding getting stranded.","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Prepared to be humbled,"Man, I never thought I could love an inanimate object so much, but this guy takes the cake. Small, cute, compact. I have never owned a robot vacuum before but having 2 short-haired, mild-shedding dogs, I wanted some ""extra"" help around the house. I thought I was on top of the constant dog hair tumbleweeds making way through my home. I thought my floors were pretty clean. I boasted about vacuuming every day, if not everyday with both a central vac for deeper cleans and a wireless for a quick touch-up. But when I opened up the dirt-catcher, I was taken aback and a little humiliated by the amass of dust and dog hair after I had just vacuumed the day before. Eufy didn't brag or give any smug looks as he continued to pick up on my slack. Which he has done twice a day since just getting him a short 24 hours ago. I think I have emptied the compartment about 6 times, not because his dirt-catcher is too small, but the amount of debris he picks up is substantial. The way he meticulously wiggles and uses his brushes to get the edges is super satisfying to watch. I have only had him working on my hardwood floors with a few area carpets. He transitions between each flooring type with ease utilizing the boost IQ feature which provides higher suction on carpeted areas. My hardwoods are noticeably cleaner for the eyes and for the soul. My area carpets still have some noticeable dog hairs ingrained deep when given a closer look. But unless your guests are sitting on the floor, it looks clean. He follows an unpredictable zig zag pattern which makes him cover almost all of the floor areas. On his first trek, I watched as he would pass by lines of dirt and thought my floors would be splotchy. Again, he proves me wrong and continued on his way to get every area. He never got stuck and manages to wiggle his way in and out of tight areas. I let him charge up for a few hours and he will work tirelessly for about an hour and a half before finding his way back to home base. The dogs have learned to let him be and retreat to their dog bed as he does his thing throughout the house. The fiance is also weary of a robotic mechanism lurking throughout the house, hearing him thump down our brick-like tiled hallway. But, seeing how much joy this genius robot brings me as I excitedly show off the full dirt catcher compartment has subsided all their hesitations. I have yet to use any timing features and only run him as needed. But the remote buttons seem pretty straight forward. The noise level is a slight hum when he is in another room, loud hum when nearby, but not too much so that you can't enjoy watching TV or having a phone conversation. I'm hoping by tomorrow, he will have my hard floor surfaces at bay and he can start working on my low-rise bedroom carpets. Thanks Eufy for humbling me, making my floors look noticeably cleaner, tormenting the dogs and fiance to my amusement and making my home more cleansing for the soul.","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2022"

B07R295MLS,5,Great No Frills Robot Vacuum,"Super happy with this purchase, after years of wanting a robo vac, I pulled the trigger on two of these vacuums over Prime Day. Our home is two stories so we have one each on both floors. I recommend these vacuums without hestitation, and think that a robot vacuum is a must have for any pet owner. These have significantly reduced pet hair throughout our home and have allowed for longer intervals between a ""deep clean"" with our normal vacuum (a shark). I did a lot of research before settling on the Eufy brand. They are somehow associated with Anker (not sure if different brands of the same company or what) and I have always been very satisfied with Anker products so I felt at ease jumping into the robot vacuum game with two vacuums. I have owned these for about two months now. We have three dogs, two small dogs with very short black hair, and a medium dog who is about 60 pounds with short white hair that edges on the longer side - think the length of a lab's hair. We admittedly did not vacuum enough and would have clumps of white hair in certain corners of the house and underneath furniture. This is a no frills vacuum, and as such does not use laser mapping or allow for setting this to run on certain days of the week only. It does have a daily schedule you can easily turn on and off. I use the automatic scheduling featue and have the vacuum scheduled to run at 10 AM every day - I opted for during the day when we are at work as to avoid the noise at night. They are quiet vacuums, but they do have a tendency to give items ""love taps"" when the sensors are unable to read certain items. They do occassionally get stuck - sometimes they will work themselves into a tight spot and not be able to figure out how to get out. They have sensors but sometimes do not read smaller things - they do bump into furniture legs and people legs. The front bumper has a spring so it does give and I am not worried about dents in furniture. Since it does not map the room with a laser or have memory, it does have an erratic cleaning pattern. It will go until it encounters an obstacle and then change course. The wheel marks in the carpet admittedly look like a drunk idiot was running the vacuum but it seems to have no trouble getting the entire space. Our home is about 1700 square foot with a mixture of low pile carpet, medium pile carpet, vinyl tile and linoleum. This vacuum does a great job across the board. They do a good job of keeping the house pet hair free when ran daily. It runs in three rooms downstairs - an office and living room (low pile, flat woven carpet) and a utility room (vinyl tiles). It runs in our dining room, living room, hallway (medium pile), and kitchen (linoleum). It runs about 10 minutes longer downstairs due to the carpet being shorter and flat woven. Does a good job both upstairs and downstairs. I occassionally set it up in the bedrooms when those are cleaned and robot proofed on the single room setting. The whisker attachments at the front allow the vacuums to get the hair clumps that seem to congregated in corners. It will get stuck on cords and high pile carpet - if we forget to close off the bathroom it will get stuck on the high pile bath rug we have. It will occassionally lose a whicker attachment somewhere, usually when it encounters an obstacle (high pile rug, weird tight spot, a pile of papers, cords). Once you robot vacuum proof your cords and rooms, these are great! TLDR; recommended for a no-frills vacuum, powerful enough for daily upkeep of pet hair, recommend without hesitation.","Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2019"
B07R295MLS,5,Impressive,"After comparing various self-propelled, 'robot' vacuums, I settled on the Eufy. It had a 4.5 star review from thousands on Amazon, and it was less costly than the Roomba. It was easy to assemble. The instructions were clear and concise. To test it, I first vacuumed with my upright, which picked up a lot of visible particles in the carpet. Then I turned the Eufy loose. WOW. It picked up a ton of additional dirt, dust and hair that my Bissell left behind. The ''crud box'', which is what I call the chamber which contains all the crud it picks up from your floor, is fairly small. You have to empty it often. You also have to clean the roller brush fairly often too. But overall, my initial impression is two thumbs up. UPDATE AFTER A COUPLE WEEKS OF USING IT: This thang sucks a lot of crap out of my carpet which my normal upright Bissell vacuum (which I like a lot) misses. I am shocked and disgusted at the crap inside the box which holds the contents from the carpet. Pet hair, dirt, dust.....and this is AFTER I vacuum with the Bissell, which also picks up a lot of crud. I bought my home a year ago and the previous owner allegedly had the carpet cleaned; not so sure I believe that. I may reach the point where I remove the carpet in favor of wood or vinyl flooring. The Eufy is still a welcome addition to my home. It's not hard to maintain and it does impressive work. 2/25/23 update: The Eufy continues to be a welcome member of my home. It does require cleaning after it vacuums my upstairs carpet, which comprises two bedrooms and a master bathroom. I clean the ''crud box'', which contains all the crud the Eufy picks up, with water and a Lysol wipe. I'm still using the same brushes and filter which came with the unit, although I do have replacements on hand. Before the Eufy starts sucking, I have to pick up all the cat toys, cables and cords, and other small objects off the floor so that the unit doesn't try to suck them up. All in all, it's still doing great and I'm about to buy ANOTHER Eufy for my downstairs, which is the kitchen, dining room, den and sitting area. No carpet. I've turned the current Eufy loose on the downstairs areas (wood floor, tile) several times and it does a terrific job on those surfaces. It's not limited to just doing carpet. A few notes for you to consider -- *The unit does not tip and fall down stairs. It ''sees'' the top stair and vectors itself away from the stairs. *Inspect the roller, brushes and wheels after each vacuuming, just to make sure they're all in good shape. *I would suggest buying replacement brushes and filters to have on hand. *After each vacuuming adventure, in addition to cleaning the ''crud box'' as described above, wipe off the bottom of the unit too, as it does accumulate some dust. *When the Eufy is done, it returns home on it's own to the charging station. *The remote control works great.","Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2022"
B07R295MLS,5,Exceeded my expectations!,"I did not have high expectations for this - but took a chance on it on the recommendation of a friend, because i did not want to spend the $$$ on the other brands. Very glad I did - has been awesome! I have a Corgi who sheds nonstop. I use a ""broombi"" to sweep which is fine, but this gives me that time back!! Works on the wood floors, to the tile, to a room rug - it goes under furniture, bed, etc. I only need to wipe around chair/furniture legs, etc. Understandable and not a problem.

B07R295MLS,5,Our Little Buddy,"NOTE: Tips for potential buyers at the end! tl;dr - Worthwhile investment with minimal fuss (beyond the first week; once you clear out the wire/cable hazards that you forgot about) The Good: +Quiet operation advertised isn't a lie, but it's not totally silent. If you live alone and always have music/TV on for background noise, it won't intrude. If you have kids, your kids will probably be louder and you won't notice. +Picks up way more dust than you realize you had. I guess for some people this could be a bad thing (something about ignorance being bliss). +It's a lot lower to the floor (slim) than the pictures make it seem. It definitely surprised me by all the furniture it was able to get under. +Easy to maintain. The dustbin is easy to remove and empty. The roller brush, sweeper brushes, and filter are easy to replace. The sensors are easy to clean. +Less dusting! I don't have to dust surfaces as much as I used to. So overall even less housework than I expected. +I thought it was a little weird seeing how some of the other reviewers talk about this robovac as if they just gained another member of the family (like a dog or a cat)... I totally get it now. BTW we named our ""Maru-chan"" (丸ちゃん）... maru as in the Japanese meaning for ""circle"" and chan as in the term of address for someone close to you. Simple, but my wife absolutely loves the name. The Bad -You may be either put-off, disturbed, or annoyed by the way it constantly bumps into things. It has a bump sensor in the front.... and it senses by bumping. I got used to it really quickly, especially since I previously read another reviewer talking about how he calls it his ""drunken little buddy"" because of how it bumps into things. This ended up making it kind of a cute charm to me, but maybe not to you. -Can't really fault this one: It lacks home mapping features (you'll see this feature reserved for more pricier models from competing brands). You'll sometimes see it running over areas previously cleaned. Eventually over the course of a week it'll get a good clean of everything though. Just do a good baseline clean (maybe run it 3-4 times throughout a day) and just leave it on a once-a-day schedule to maintain. Odd Issues Encountered (during my 10 months of ownership): -Ramped itself up the base of a toilet and got stuck between the toilet base and wall (two occurences) -Closed a door to a room and blocked itself in from the charging base (three occurences, two in the same room), would be solved if I used a proper door-stop -Bump sensor got stuck to itself on one side, causing it to roll around in circles (one occurence) Tips For Potential Buyers: 1) If you've never baby-proofed or pet-proofed a home before..... just make sure you get all the cables/wires out of the way. Including the power cords to appliances/devices you installed years ago and forgot about. Example: my nightstand lamp next to my bed. It rolled under my nightstand and got tangled up by the cord. 2) If you program it to run while you're at work, you'll probably spend about a week searching for it nearly every day you come home because of #1 above. Almost always because of some power cord dangling somewhere that you forgot about because it's been years. 3) If there are areas that you absolutely can't robovac-proof, purchase the magnetic strip tapes to create a ""No-Go Zone"" 4) It's strong enough to push stuff around. It pushed my solid wood dining chairs around. If you have pedestals or anything that might get pushed over, beware. 5) As mentioned in The Bad, do a good baseline clean at first. And then program it to run once a day to maintain the clean. I recommend doing another baseline clean on a monthly basis.","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019"
B07R295MLS,5,Great purchase for Black Friday,"This vacuum cleaner has been a game-changer for me! The battery life is more than enough for a one-bedroom apartment. It’s also incredibly versatile—thanks to its slim design, I can easily clean tricky spots like under the AC unit and the bed, areas that used to be a nightmare with my old stick vacuum. Best of all, this vacuum has saved me so much time! Cleaning is quicker and more efficient, giving me extra time to relax or focus on other things I enjoy. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a hassle-free cleaning experience.","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Wow! Love it!,"I had been resisting getting one of these robo vacs - I thought they might be more of a gimmick than really useful. Man, was I surprised! Actually, I was almost disgusted at the amount of dust and stuff it picks up. I'm not Ms. Perfect House Cleaner by any means, but I had no idea.... I have grown to really love it - to the point of naming it, and almost looking on it as a pet. Maybe not that much, but very fondly! I've had it more than a month now and run it every day or so. Each time, wow, I am amazed at the stuff in the debris box! I dump it after every cleaning. I also take out the filter and clean it after every cycle, using the small brush utensil provided. I both bang it in the garbage container (low in it to keep the expelled dust from shooting out back over the floor!) and then clean it with the brush portion of the utensil. Instructions don't say to clean the filter every time but since I am cleaning out the debris box, I feel I might as well take out the filter for cleaning. It always looks (and is) very dusty after a cleaning and don't want it clogged up. Besides, this expands the life of a filter. Every other time, I take out the brush roller and clean it, especially if it has made a run in the bathroom in the area where I brush my hair. I have recommended this vac to relative and friends. I am very okay with it using Bounce technology versus mapping technology. This is the only con against this particular machine, if you want to see it like that. It doesn't bother me. In fact, it makes it more amusing somehow. If I want a specific area cleaned, I can always guide it ,and direct it to the area. It has other handy features also, including going back to its home base when it runs low on its battery charge. I know there is a very expensive vac out there that empties itself automatically. I don't see the advantage. I see the state of the filter after every cycle and would have to clean it so since I would be handling the robo vac after each use, and is so easy to dump the debris box, why would anyone pay 8 to 9 hundred more for that feature? You still have to (or should) clean the filter, and check the roller balls to make sure they are free of anything that could entangle them. Or at least, I do. It doesn't take that long to check/clean it after a cycle, and it does such a great job, I want to take care of it as much as possible. Like I say, I don't mind the Bounce technology versus the mapping technology. We get a kick and a good laugh from watching it zoom along and suddenly stop and change direction as if it saw a spot it needs to clean. Or carefully extricate itself from amongst the dining room chairs drawn up to the table or other entrapments. Yeah, I know, we anthropomorphize the little darling. But it is entertaining while it cleans. There are three spots in the house where it gets stuck and it sends out a cry for help - beep, beep, beep. And I never tire of watching it power down and guide itself back to its home base. If I then reach down, remove the debris box, clean it and put it back, jostling it a little bit, it will wait until I have put the box back and then Beep!, back up, realign itself and slide back onto home base. The little stinker! It is very picky about being 'just so' on home base! Well, as you can tell, I am very fond of this robo vac. I hope we have many years together, lol.","Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2020"
B07R295MLS,5,Great Machine; keep reasonable expectations,"I purchased the Eufy RoboVac vacuum in 2019, and have been using it twice a week to clean my hardwood floors, and an area rug. In last 1.5 years I have not noticed any drop in suction power or battery, and the vacuum is still going strong. The vacuum has no fancy bells or whistles but it is terrific at its job of cleaning. Best thing about this vacuum is its low profile design that allows it to go under furniture and clean the area. It does not have mapping function and so when I initially bought it, I was very skeptical of its cleaning ability. So, I dropped small pieces of paper around my house in corners, under furniture etc., and I was pleasantly surprised that all the pieces were picked up when the vacuum returned to the dock. Also, after a cleaning cycle if you opened the dust collector, you will be surprised to see the amount of dirt it has captured. Things to keep in mind - 1. Performance on carpets - best for low to medium pile carpet. Keep in mind that no robotic vacuum cleaner on the market can replace or compare to the corded vacuum when it comes to deep cleaning. 2. Long hair do gets tangled in the brushes. A quick 2-3 minute maintenance of emptying the dust collector, cleaning filter and removing the hair tangled on the cleaning brushes before use will make a huge difference in cleaning performance. 3. Cleaning pattern - Does not have a fixed well defined cleaning pattern. However, it does a great job at cleaning. Also, due to unavailability of mapping feature robot might clean a specific area more than during cleaning cycle thereby requiring more time to clean. From my experience, for an effective cleaning of lower level of my house with 4 rooms a complete cycle (fully charged to returning to dock) is required. 4. Suction power - while the eufy RoboVac vacuum has low suction power (1300 PA) compared to (2500PA) with some high end robotic vacuum, from a practical standpoint there is not a huge difference in cleaning ability. Most Robotic vacuums are good for removing dust, cereals, and other extremely light weight debris. 5. No obstacle avoidance - Eufy RoboVac does not have obstacle avoidance capability. It will gently bump with some objects in the household like table legs. From my experience sometimes it has resulted in light weight objects on top of table shifting or falling. Also it sometimes gets stuck on round base (such as ones with Pedestal fan). An easy fix was to put some obstacles around such furniture/objects. Like with all other robotic vacuums ensure that there are no wires/cables on the floor. Provided cables ties can be used to organize the wires. 6. Eufy recommends that area 3 ft/1 m on the left and right side and within 6 ft/2 m of the front of the Charging Base be kept clear. I had occasionally had slightly lower clear space than the recommendation, however the robot was able to return to charging. If you don’t have space to ensure required clearance then I would suggest that you contact Eufy to see if the robot will work with available space. While I have pointed out some limitations of the RoboVac I still gave it a five star considering its size ( to enable it to clean under furniture), value for money, and performance over an 1+ year of use.","Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2021"
B07R295MLS,5,Simple friendly cleaning bot,"This is the first robovac I've had; I love gadgets and I wanted something to save me having to clean so often, especially now that I have a baby at home I wanted something that could help keep the floors clean and Be affordable. This vacuum is definitely on the more affordable side of other robovacs. This robotic vacuum cleaner is so simple and easy to use, you just need to take it out the box and clip on the little brushes and it is ready to go. You can just set it to auto and off it goes bumping it's way around your place. You use a small remote control to use the bot and with it you can access it's added features, like 'spot clean' and 'edges' and 'single room'. Or you can just use the remote to move the bot around vacuuming wherever you want. It's not too loud and as long as it doesn't get stuck and start beeping, baby can sleep through it's noise. The first time we set it on we followed it around seeing where it was getting stuck... there's some furniture it struggles with, and any cables lying around will jam it. After a few weeks of use, we found that to get the best clean we have to use the 'single room' function - basically, you place the bot in the room you want vacuuming and close the doors to keep it there until it finishes the program. Obviously, you have to prepare the room by removing any smaller objects or items that could cause it to jam - Like plugs and certain furniture like the pics attached. The vacuum arrives with cable ties to help with that. It boasts a 'scheduling' feature where you set the timer and let it run on a schedule, but we couldn't seem to get it to work. Also, we gave up on it as we feel like the room by room method does a better job of covering the whole area. It doesn't keep track of where it's been since it just goes along bumping about. Actually, sometimes it bumps into things then turns around, and other times it just turns in the middle of the room, like for no reason. See video below, it just turned around without bumping into anything. Plus it's never really able to return to base on its own. But like I said i use the room by room method anyway. I have to say it does do a really good job moving from room to room, even where the threshold is raised it doesn't struggle with that at all, just as it does well to transition from floor to rug. We have mostly hard floor in our place, except a medium pile rug in the living room. It definitely does a better job on hard floors, as it is noticeable when it goes over It but may end up leaving little crumbs. We've had it for a few weeks and it gets used multiple times per week. The thing I do love about it is that it's slim and fits under most furniture - like our dresser, bed, and crib! I know I don't bother to clean under there too often, so it's great to let this bot keep it clean. However, I am not sure about the longevity of it. My previous vacuum lived for over 5 years, and I would expect at least a couple of years life from this one, but as I mentioned above, I already noticed it being less effective on the rug than the first few times we used it. Also, the little brushes are looking rough already, they will need to be replaced soon and it only came with 1 extra set. Customer service reached out to remind me we had to keep the rolling brush clean I think that's a weekly task, and you have to replace the brushes every 6 months. Overall it's a great little machine that does a very decent job of keeping the floor clean especially since it means you don't have to do it yourself!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2018"

B07R295MLS,5,"Fairly dumb, but that's quite alright!","I've owned many Anker and Anker-related items and have only once disliked one of their products. The eufy Robovac 11S is not that product. This is without a doubt one of the best values in vacs on the market. Had I purchased an earlier version I might have thought differently, but the extra power and slightly slimmer design on the 11S is what makes this one hard to resist. This is my first robot vac, but many of my friends have various brands. Some rave (iRobot owners, mainly) and some whine (Neato and Samsung owners). None has had a eufy, so it's been interesting to be the first of my friends to own one. My wife didn't feel this was anything we really needed to purchase; we either have to get out the big Bissell vacuum (on loose pile carpet), the Shark (mainly for steps) or a broom (for hardwood/tile/linoleum areas). Cut and dried. A robot vac wouldn't be of much use with it's far less powerful motor. Gimmick. Then she watched as the Robovac went to work over the course of a week. I have 1450 sq. ft. upstairs, 70% hardwood/tile/linoleum, 30% loose pile carpet. Downstairs I've got 100% loose pile carpet in 1100 sq. ft. of finished space. I run the vacuum upstairs for 2-3 days, then I move the charging station downstairs and run for 3-4 days, then repeat the cycle. On the hardwood areas, a greatroom of kitchen/dining/living room, hallway, and a bathroom, then two bedrooms and a den with carpet, the vac runs around/under the couch, two reclining chairs, coffee table, end tables, clawfoot pedestal table and four chairs, some area/throw rugs, etc. with no issues. I always run the device on AUTO, which allows it to ramp up the motor when it detects it's on carpet. The vac runs through its various ""programmed"" patterns randomly as it runs for 90+ minutes. It's quite mesmerizing to watch, actually. The remote is handy to use when you have a specific area you need run over and you can see the dirt/dust/leaves/cereal; you can just steer the vac over the area a few times, then let it go back to doing its own thing. I would say that each randomized run on my 1450 sq. ft. area will average about 65-70% coverage. That doesn't sound very good, right? But think about it running EVERY DAY doing 70%, and you'll see that the entire area will likely get fully vacuumed at least once during the week. My wife was shocked when, after the first run, I emptied the dust bin and it was completely FILLED. She and my daughter have long hair; I had to peel that all off the beater brush, as well. After each run, I empty the bin and ""trim"" the brush of hair. It ALWAYS has a fairly full cup! I have a dog, a Havanese, but he doesn't shed at all, so the mess in the cup is almost scary to look at! Yuck! After the first two weeks of running the Robovac around the house, I no longer run it daily; now it's on a manual shift, running upstairs for a couple of days a week, then downstairs for the same time (I usually run on the carpet an extra day). It does such a good job at quickly picking up the obvious junk that you just don't need it running daily, which should extend the life of the battery. So it's not a smart device, but it's never once hit the edge of the stairs and fallen off; it always finds ""home"" before the charge runs out (and it takes some stupid long walks around the rooms to get home, sometimes), and it has to be cleaned after almost every run. We do have to make a walk around the area to pick up blankets and charging cables and dog toys, and put a couple of squeezy toys under the coffee table to stop the vac from getting stuck under it (it's on a tight pile area rug, so the wheels dig in and it gets stuck under the edge). But is it worth it? Yep. My wife is now a huge fan, and has bragged about it to our friends on several occasions. The price was perfect, the quality of the device's build is excellent, it runs fairly quietly, and it does a great job of hitting every area of your house even without a huge brain or blockade devices. We don't even get out a broom any longer, unless we notice buildup in corners (and really, that's rarely happening). It's just one less thing we need to worry about in our busy household!","Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2018"

B07R295MLS,5,Impressive for the price!,"We have all hardwood, and two cats, so after sweeping twice a day for weeks on end I was really considering a robo vacuum. Being a cheapskate, I didn’t really commit until last week and bought this guy. It does take quite a while to fully charge, but letting it go for a while everyday makes it so much nicer in the home!! Just in the first day it sucked up way more than I thought we had hiding on our floors. And it gets under the couch! I definitely would love if this had an app so that I could customize it and all, but I went for the lowest price, so, I knew what I was getting. Super easy to set up, the only thing that I don’t like is the vents situation since I have to put something heavy over each one to prevent the vacuum from damaging itself. But, overall, I’m so happy with it! And it comes with a cleaning tool, which I’ve already used in the first week since my long hair is a menace. I’d say if you’re considering one, this is a good one!! I’m hoping to get 3-5 years out of it and I’d say it’s a good investment for that.

My first floor is hardwood, and the second floor is carpet. I was excited when I came across this that can both mop and vacuum. I think it’s a great deal for the price as well..Plus, we have a cat so the floor needs frequent vacuuming. The size is exactly what I expected—not too large. I’ve used it once so far, I’m quite satisfied with the results!","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Wow impressed at this little device,Update: This has a programmable schedule. I wrote that it did not. Whoops helps when you read those pesky instructions.... When these type of vacuums came out almost 2 decades ago I laughed. What a stupid useless device right out of a sharper image catalog or an inflight magazine. Well fast forward and vacuuming is a pain in the butt. With all the hardwood floor and throw rugs we have and throw in a dog it's a real chore. A friend of mine purchased one of these who if it was up to him he would still cut his grass with a push mower so I was really surprised he bought one. I asked how it did in his house since he has carpet everywhere he said it work great. I was over his house and looked at the one he had and I was surprised at how they've evolved and how much more powerful they were. So this one here was on sale and for the price I thought let's give it a try and see what happens. Well after two weeks of owning it we are extremely impressed. There's no little stray pet hairs anywhere on the hardwood floor cleans anything off the kitchen floor with ease goes under the couch under the beds we only got hung up once and that was our fault because we left a cord out. I run it every day and I'm seeing less and less dirt in the catcher which is good. Be aware though you can't just leave junk on the floor like shoes and everything like that which we don't anyway so it has no problem getting around. Now some of the pluses are I'm amazed at how well it cleans. in maneuvers all over the place goes under couches under furniture under the dining room table along the edges of the kitchen cabinets. It's pretty quiet. It was super easy to set up. So some of the tips on using this thing keep stuff off the floor like cords and shoes and anything laying around like dog toys or any junk. empty the catch bin and clean the brush frequently in fact for now every time it runs I clean it and empty it because it fills up with fuzz from the rugs. Some of the pluses of this unit is it's cost compared to a Roomba it works very well comes with extra replacement brushes comes with an extra HEPA filter and it's easy to empty the catch container. Some things I wish it did have is a self-scheduling cleaning routine. It's not a big deal it comes with a remote and every day we just start it either in the morning or when we come home after work and let it do its thing. So far it works like a champ and the floors are clean. I was thinking of getting a second one for upstairs. I am really amazed at how well these things work I used to just laugh at people that had them now 18 years later I have one. Completely happy with this model the only thing I wish it did have was a self-scheduling cleaning routine. Not a showstopper. And again it came with a spare crevice brushes HEPA filter and a remote. It's built like a tank. The roller brush the catch container the underneath of it is extremely well made. it's not some cheap plastic vacuum cleaner on two wheels.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2020"
B07R295MLS,5,Great value and works perfectly,"It is easy to know when to charge it, and it finds the charging base easily. The suction is great and picks up a lot of dirt and hair. The filter is easy to clean. Unfortunately the latch broke within a month so I have to carefully take out the dust bin or else it dumps everywhere. Other than that, I’m very happy with it.","Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Hmmm,"I am a iRobot Roomba fan that found Eufy enhanced iRobot nicely as a second, less expensive, quality investment. Eufy has less hangup with it's slim build, seems always to find 'home' but iRobot's mapping always wins. That being said both products seem to LOVE the dining room chair challenge as they usually drift that way if no human intervention. Go figure.","Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Pretty Good for My Perfect Use Case,"As a disclaimer, I have essentially the perfect use case for a robot vacuum. I live in a medium-size studio apartment with light-colored floors, no carpets, no throw rugs, and no pets. I have a dust mite allergy, and after living in my apartment for 8 months or so I started sneezing a bunch from dust that accumulated under hard to move things like my bed and under shelves. I’m not very large or strong so it would have been incredibly difficult to move my furniture every time I needed to vacuum under there. I decided to throw money at the problem and try out a robot vacuum. And it worked incredibly well! I had to empty the dust trap twice the first time it cleaned under my bed (ew). It was unable to pick up a two-golfball sized dust bunny but I was able to use the manual mode to push it out to me so I could grab it myself. As a side note the manual mode is super useful for getting things out from under places, but I’m sure that that would be considered off-label use. So far I’ve run it 3 times and I’m super happy with it so far. It only got stuck a couple of times, and it was totally my fault for leaving that stuff out. The only downside is that if you have long hair and run it infrequently (e.g. once per week) you’ll be cleaning hair out of all of the brushes every time you run it. SO MUCH HAIR gets tangled in the brushes. I would imagine that if you have pets you’d have to run it at least 2-3x per week and may even have to clean the brushes out mid-run. If you live in a house with multiple women with long hair, you may also want to run it more frequently and clean the brushes after out each time. On that note, I saw a review by someone saying that the brushes break a lot, and I would guess that cleaning the brushes out more often could help prevent that. A large quantity of long hair wrapped tightly around it would put a decent amount of stress on it and could cause it to break over time. I’m also pretty happy with the pathfinding. Yeah it bumps into stuff a lot, but that’s literally what it’s supposed to do. It DOES NOT map your house, and if you want that you should probably be prepared to shell out way more than $130 for it. I’ll be happy if it lasts 18 months or so, because at that price point it would be unreasonable to expect it to last years and years. I’ve only had it for 3 weeks so far though so I’ll update this review if it breaks a month from now or something.","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2022"
B07R295MLS,5,I really like my 11s but I like Anker even more!,"The Eufy 11s is very easy to use and surprisingly effective at its job. My house has tile flooring with an open floor plan, lots of angles and a large, bound, ultra tall shag carpet in the great room. This would make any robo vac a challenge to use and was the primary reason I had never bought one before. A friend bought one and let me try it on my floor. I decided I could work with it, so I bought the 11s. At that time they were $119 and that seemed like a decent enough price to give it a try. I couldn't see any advantage that another robo vac costing hundreds more could offer. I still don't. I will buy one or two more of these when they are back in that price range. What really impressed me was the company and the service. The first unit started leaving its base without being programmed to do so. I made a call to customer service and got through right away. I was sent a new unit and received it either the next day or the day after. They didn't make me wait. The unit I received had a bad battery. Again, I called and was sent a new battery. Shortly after installing the new battery it developed another problem; the unit would leave its base and immediately return to it. I made another call and this agent asked me to send a video showing what the unit was doing so the engineers could trouble shoot it. She also sent me a new battery in case it was a battery issue. She told me she would send me an email with a link to send the video. After receiving the email I was a bit confused by what she sent so I called customer service again for clarification. The agent I spoke with this time (Sergio) asked me if I would try something while he was on the phone with me. He had me do a reset by toggling the on/off switch a number of times. Bingo, it was up and running! Pretty damn simple. I want to give a shout out to Sergio for taking the extra step to help me. If he hadn't done this a lot of time would have been wasted both on my end and the company end. This is not a complaint about the product in any way. It's an excellent product and things just happen. What ultimately matters is what the company does. Anker stands by their products 100%. They didn't jack me around, they didn't make me jump through hoops, and they didn't make me wait. I love this company! Again, a thanks to Sergio in customer support for making the extra effort to help m . I will continue to buy Anker products!","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2023"
B07R295MLS,4,"I have 7 animals, sandy soil, dark wavy hardwood floors. Perfect vacuum for my home.","I have always wanted a robovac, but was always afraid of the dreaded *excrement* encounters in my home because I am owned by 2 ferrets, 2 very old semi-incontinent dogs, 1 long haired cat, and a young aussiedoodle who loves to dig in our sandy soil. Then we downsized into a new 1800 sq ft home that has very dark wavy hardwood floors, and I have a lot of furniture. I was going nuts trying to keep the floors clean and it was a losing battle. Something had to give and it had to work within my extreme conditions. I also didn't want to pay $500+ for a vacuum that failed me. I did a lot of research, talked to friends who had robovacs learning the pros and cons of every brand. Eufy was not on the radar of any of my friends. No one had one. All of their vacs were beloved because of the bells and whistles such as; timed cleaning, room mapping, stair protections, border restrictions, whole house cleaning, etc. All the things that add to the price and none of the things I could use. Based on online reviews and Consumer Reports I choose the Eufy 11s. Here is what I love and the 'not so much' love list. What I love 1. I run the vacuum only when and where I know there are no hidden naughty ferret potty spots and during a time when I can pick up the pee pads. About 800 sq ft area at a time. Running the vac for about 1 to 1.5 hours. 2. The vac does an amazing job cleaning around the legs of chairs, which all animal owners know this is where hair gets trapped. 3. The herky-jerky random cleaning pattern will drive you bonkers at first but given enough time the job gets done. 4. I am amazed at how much hair, sand, and dander this monster picks up. 5. I thought the small size of the debris compartment would require constant emptying. I was wrong. I do empty and clean it after each run because I'm a little cra-cra. 6. I thought all the animal toys and beds would be a problem. I soon learned the vac pushes the toys around and moves the beds out of the way and keeps on going. 7. The vac plays well with my ferrets and cat, providing a constant source of entertainment (*caution- if you have ferrets you must cover the rubber bumper with tape, I used painters tape, because they will try to eat the bumper.) The animals are unable to flip the vac over. Ferrets love riding on top, and will quickly learn how to turn the vac off and on. The amusement factor reached the point that I had to move the docking station into the laundry room to keep the cat and ferrets from turning it off and on. 8. Pee and poop does happen. Avoid this at all costs. It is NOT fun. Just don't go there. Always check the room thoroughly before starting the vac. 9. The vac has no problems with tile, throw rugs, etc. 10. There are several choices for small or whole area cleaning, timed cleaning, single room cleaning, edge cleaning, and power suction. Normal suction works fine, and I LOVE the edge cleaner it practically climbs up the wall. What I am not in love with 1. The most common error beep I get is the sensors are dirty. Given my home, I'm not surprised, just wish it wasn't quite as sensitive. I wish the remote would beep when an error code occurs when the vac is in another room. 2. The filter/foam (they do provide you with extra parts) will not last very long because of the fine dander and sand it picks up. I wish the little cleaner they provide did a better job of cleaning the folds of the filter. 3. The filter assembly area could be easier to clean, especially for those of us with old eyes, and arthritic fingers. 4. This is a beef I have with all products. I wish manufacturers would give more thought to the growing segment of our population with adaptive needs. For example, 6 pt type can't be read by older or vision impaired individuals. Make arrows larger and in contrasting colors. MAKE LABELS LEGIBLE! Make the buttons on the remote bigger. This isn't rocket science people! 5. As other reviewers have stated the parts are made to wear out. Gouging customers by forcing them to purchase replacement parts doesn't make us happy. Design a product that has longevity and you are more likely to have repeat customers. 6. Adding a *find the vac* tone to the remote would be very helpful for finding the powered down vac that always seems to power off in hidden locations. 7. I wish the wheels would pop out for cleaning. All in all I highly recommend this entry level robovac. It doesn't have the bells and whistles, but that also means it has fewer parts to break. If you have a lot of pets or hairy people, this is the robovac I would recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2018"
B07R295MLS,4,I REALLY LIKE IT,"I got an iRobot Roomba 690 vacuum for Christmas and love it. I have not manually vacuumed since Christmas! As I live in a two story house, I decided to purchase another robotic vacuum, and seeing the Eufy was rated as the “best of 2018” I decided to get it. Both vacuum’s appear to do the job, and I would like to compare them: The Eufy has two brushes on either side, whereas my Roomba has only one. I find that the Eufy appears to clean the general floor area, and then go back for edges, and the two side brushes help with this. Both are a little “stupid.” I try not to watch them do their job as I consistently want to interfere and nudge them where I see actual dirt/particles on the floor. Both will go seemingly all around dirt, retreading spots they’ve already been (and wasting battery life in the process) rather than moving along any real sensible path. However, I have also noticed that the Eufy seems to go along straighter paths/lines than the Roomba. However, both are supposed to return to their bases when the job is complete. The Eufy has found its way back to its base one time as far as I can determine. The Roomba finds its way back about 1/2 of the time. The Eufy will continue to run if picked up, the Roomba shuts itself down immediately. The Eufy is slimmer than the Roomba. I find that the Eufy tends to get stuck less frequently than the Roomba. For example, it can go under my coffee table that sits close to the floor, whereas the Roomba would get it’s front stuck under the coffee table and signal for help. The Eufy has gotten itself stuck about twice since I’ve had it, and each time it is under the chairs at my dining room table… it is a little wide and has gotten stuck between the legs. The Roomba frequently gets itself into jams, and only seems to turn left when trying to get out of them… In terms of navigation, both do their jobs in an almost haphazard fashion. I would like to see them have an actual “dirt sensor” that would lead them toward areas with noticeable particles. The Roomba does have some sort of sensor as when it finds an especially dirty area it will swirl around it several times. The Eufy apparently has a mode where it applies extra suction, but I’m unsure if it automatically switches to this or if it has to be manually set to do so. The Roomba DOES NOT LIKE BLACK RUGS or heavy pile rugs. I have two rugs that are edged in black, and the Roomba senses a barrier and either will not go onto the rug or will get stuck shortly after moving onto it. I also have a medium pile rug with some black squares on it and the Roomba dies out on the rug every single time. The Eufy navigates these FAR BETTER… both the medium pile rug as well as rugs lined in black or having black squares. The Roomba bangs into furniture and other items sometimes quite violently. I have a very heavy antique mirror that the Roomba banged into and it came crashing to the floor. I also have some large candles on either side of the fireplace that the Roomba knocked around like crazy every day. The Eufy seems to notice edges better and will actually stop itself when it comes close to an object and move around it without hitting it, or, if it does go toward it, it is far more gentle. However, this sensor also can impede its capacity to go under objects like couches. The Roomba alway went under my couch, whereas I don’t think the Eufy has ever been under it as it appears to sense it as a barrier and goes along the front of it only. While both say they have edge sensors, neither the Roomba nor the Eufy seem to be able to navigate edges to stairs very well at all. While neither have actually flung themselves over, they both get stuck at the edge with a wheel or two over and have to be saved. So some barrier is necessary to prevent them from falling over the edges of stairs. The Eufy to be FAR quieter than than the Roomba. Sometimes when it is running I can’t even hear it. The Eufy I have has a remote and is not connected to WiFi. But, apparently, there is a newer (and a little more expensive version) that can be so connected. The Roomba connects to WiFi and I can control it from my phone, and it also sends me alerts (when a job is done, it is stuck, etc.) Both the Eufy and the Roomba are programmable. I have them set to vacuum daily at 9:00 a.m. I set the Eufy from the remote and the Roomba from its app on my iPhone. The Roomba is definitely easier to program as I have to refer to the guide to know what I’m doing on Eufy’s remote… and then I’m still not sure I have it down correctly. The Eufy seems to go for about an hour or less and then dies out with its light orange. The Roomba appears to have a longer battery life after each charge. The Eufy has a higher suction setting that apparently can drain the battery power in 30 minutes or less. It is frustrating to see both vacuums going over the same spots continuously or routes knowing they are wasting battery life doing so. I think both could be “smarter” with greater debris detection or something. Again, I think the Eufy tends to follow a straight path just a smidge better than the Roomba, but not by much. You will want to make sure that power cords, and other such things are moved/protected from the vacuums. The Eufy, because of both brushes, gets caught up in power cords, speaker wire, etc. far more easily than the Roomba. But the Eufy comes with cord ties to tuck them away. You could just as easily use bread ties for power cords. I also have pets (three cats) and they have all sorts of toys. The smaller ones I try to keep out of the path of the vacuums. Speaking of pets, both vacuums appear to be doing well with keeping my rugs free of pet hair. I would suggest that if your pets make a mess (hairballs or accidentally going to the bathroom) that you clean this up immediately. I can only imagine the horror that would result from either of these vacuums going over those messes and how they would be drug over your entire house! Speaking of pets… my cats seem quite enamored with the vacuums and will stalk them as they go through the house. They do not appear to be afraid of them, and sometimes will sit and have them bump into them and lazily move out of the vacuums path. This is strange as one of my cats literally will run and hide if she sees me even getting the manual vacuum cleaner out to use. However, all pets are different. So, I’d introduce the vacuum and the pet as nicely as you can. Both the Eufy and the Roomba are very easy to clean/empty. I empty the dirt bins daily on them. In terms of suction, I’m not sure either of these do as well as my manual Dyson. And both the Roomba and the Eufy sometimes don’t pick up debris that would easily be handled by a conventional vacuum cleaner. However, I repeat that I have not manually had to vacuum my house since Christmas. Not once. I have thought it might be a good idea to do that about once a month though and let the robotic vacuums deal with the floors in-between. The dual brushes may help the Eufy collect debris a little better… and it definitely appears to have better edge cleaning than the Roomba. But both seem to do the job to my satisfaction overall. I like that the Roomba actually talks to me to tell me what the problem is (a job is done, it is stuck, it needs recharging). Whereas the Eufy has beeps (one, two, and three). I don’t always hear the beeping or exactly know what they mean without referring to the guide. I like both the Roomba and the Eufy. They each have their strong points and weak points. Either way, not having to manually vacuum every day is a godsend to me, and makes having pets a little less cumbersome to clean up after. If I had to choose, I’d probably go with the Eufy due to its quietness of use, better edge detection and cleaning, dual brushes, tendency to vacuum in a more directed fashion, and slimmer size coupled with less fierce bumping into objects. Hope my review was helpful.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2019"
B07R295MLS,4,A great companion for uncluttered floors,"The eufy robovac 11s (slim) is an extremely well designed vacuum that could definitely be improved in several ways. I've broken this review into two parts: first, I list common situations that should lead you to buy (or avoid!) this product. The second part talks about improvements that could be made to the system. This review has been updated, as I learn more about the product. The number of stars has been adjusted from 3 stars up to 4 stars. If you leave stuff on your floor, don't buy this robot vacuum. The 11s's navigation AI is very good, but if you leave a pile of clothes in a corner, it will get stuck on a sock. The 11s's corner brushes are very good at sweeping up dust and hair, but if your shoelaces aren't tucked inside your shoe, it will wrap them around its brushes. You cannot push all the clutter off to one side, as unlike many robot vacuums, the 11s does not come with any kind of ""invisible barrier"" tools. This can actually be a point in the 11s's favor, though! Having this robot vacuum encourages you to clean up after yourself every day. If you have kids that leave toys out, you can't elevate your computer cables off the floor, or you know that you won't care enough to keep your floor un-cluttered, then the 11s isn't for you. The number one situation where you would want the eufy is in a dorm or small apartment. It's a huge space saver and a huge time saver. The vacuum arrives in a carry handle equipped box that is barely larger than the device itself, so it's laughably easy to travel to college with. The dust bin can be emptied while the robot stays on the charging pad, so you only have to pick it up once a week. The entire device really is quieter than a microwave at maximum power, so you won't annoy anyone else on your floor. In a more traditional, multi-story home, the 11s shares the issues of many robot vacuums: it's much harder to keep the entire floor clear of clutter every single day, and it won't work if anyone leaves anything small on the ground. Obviously the robot cannot climb or clean stairs, which makes the automatic scheduling feature utterly pointless outside of a single-floor building. Most area rugs and very high quality carpets (anything half an inch or deeper) will be too much for this machine's wheels, and you'll have to invest in an upright. UPDATE ON THE HIGH PITCHED SOUND: In my original review, I complained that the eufy 11s makes a high pitched shriek while vacuuming. This is true, but isn't nearly as much of a deal breaker as I thought. First of all, I've gotten much more used to it. Obviously, that's a personal preference thing, but if high pitched sounds really bug you, this can still be the machine for you! The squeal is only audible in ""low power mode"", and goes away in max power mode. The robovac automatically uses low power on hardwood floors and high power on carpet, but if you manually select high power on a hardwood floor, the high pitched sound goes away. Although it wastes battery power, people who are bothered by the high pitched sound can force the robot into max fan speed mode when they're at home, and allow it to choose between low power and max power while they're out of the house. I give it 4 stars because the marketing and description list it as a product for any kind of home, while I see it as a product that works best in smaller, single floor situations due to the lack of barrier making tools. This second half is aimed more at eufy than at a potential consumer, but reading it might offer you more insight on how this product works. Dear Eufy: On the day I purchased this product, I noticed a potential point of failure: the plastic that secures the brush roll cover is exceedingly thin, and appears to be an intentional point of failure. The clip is supposed to bend and fit into the hole on the robot, the frame of the hole itself does not need to bend at all. The problem I have is that the most likely breaking point is on the robot itself instead of the easy to remove and replace underbelly cover. The Robovac's AI is clearly capable of detecting and avoiding ""virtual walls"", and the bot can be manually redirected with the remote control. Although it may be impossible with the current product generation, future products should include virtual walls. They could be sold separately, they wouldn't have to be battery hogs if you promote the use of rechargeable AA batteries, and as older Roombas have demonstrated, they allow a ""random"" navigation bot to know which room of a house it is cleaning. Speaking of virtual walls, the barrier around the dock is way too big! There will undoubtedly be a large ring of dust in the area that the dock is located in my room. The robovac only needs to avoid the thin strip of ground near the wall, where the dock's cable would be, not a big semicircle section of my room. Having a controller is great; it puts many of the moving parts on a cheap component, not the expensive component. That's just the theory, though, because the remote isn't sold on Amazon! What will I have to do if I'm outside the warranty period? Finally, I'd like to say two things about the controls. First, I'd like to see a few buttons and lights added to the bot itself. An orange ""brush clean""/""filter change"" reminder light (solid for weekly clean, flashing for filter replacement), and a green ""schedule set"" light (solid for ""schedule set, flashing for ""scheduled clean active""). The orange light could go to the left of the power button, while the green light would get situated to the right of the power button. I'm already certain that I'll forget to clean out the roller brush and replace the filters when the time comes. Finally part two: please, PLEASE make the ""start|stop"" be ""pause|resume"" instead. If I'm 2-3rds through an edge cleaning session and something gets tangled in the side brushes, I'll press stop to freeze the bot, but pessing start won't resume the edge cleaning session, it will begin a brand new auto clean. That's all I wanted to say about this. I don't know much about its capabilities or reliability as this is my first day owning the product, but I must admit I'm hopeful.","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2019"
B07R295MLS,4,This makes me happy,"This vacuum is pretty amazing. The app is fairly easy to figure out. The vacuum works well. It even does a rug that my other upright would not work on. Does it pick up every little thing on the floor, or clean up every dried spill on the floor? No, which is why it got 4 stars. But I’d rather do some spot touch ups than push a vacuum thru the entire house and then mop. It enables me the opportunity to clean the floors more frequently, and that is totally worth it to me. It is quite amazing to watch it work. And I’m very happy with how it works. I’ve already been recommending to friends. I learned that if you have a large open area, like a kitchen/family room open concept, it is much better to divide up the room, and have it clean one area at a time…Especially if you want to move chairs into the other area not being worked on, so it can just run without trying to work around chair legs. Anyway, I really am happy with this so far.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,Set this up by myself,"I thought I would need help to get the Eufy robot vac going, but I didn’t. When it finished sweeping, I figured out how to empty the dirt out. I’m an older woman who is usually challenged by something new like this, but I did fine. This is a very simple machine that won’t spy on you. It won’t send back a report that says you need a new couch. The only shortcoming is that, like other robot vacs, this takes quite a while to get the sweeping done. The Eufy is quieter than my microwave. My dogs were a little curious but weren’t upset when it started moving around on the floors. The dirt bin and the 3-in-1 filter are both washable. I had swept the floors the day before with my Miele vacuum, but the Eufy picked up quite a bit of dirt. I’m very impressed with my Eufy robot vac.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,"One-week review: not fully automatic, but well worth the price","Here’s our preliminary review, after less than one week of use: We have a 2,050 foot single-level Southwest style house, with saltillo tile throughout, plus a few throw rugs. We divide the house into three sections and do one at a time: (1) master bedroom suite, including BR, bath and walk-in closet; (2) living room, main hall, kitchen and dining room; and (3) guest part of hall, our two offices, guest bathroom and laundry. If you expect Robby the Robot from <i>Forbidden Planet</i>, you’re going to be disappointed. But if you work with your Eufy and consider its limitations, you’ll find it a very good tool to make vacuuming much less of a chore and even kind of fun. It does a fine job on dust bunnies and the fine mineral dust that’s ubiquitous in Northern NM. We don't have pets so don't have much hair on our floors. We prep each section of the house by removing as many chairs, floor lamps and clothes trees as we can move easily. We remove or put up all throw rugs and any electrical cords, bedclothes or other droopy items that might drop into Eufy’s reach. (It hung up only once, on a thick speaker cable under the TV table.) This prep takes less than five minutes per section. We did try Eufy on one small, thick wool throw rug. It didn’t get stuck, but it scrunched the rug a bit, so we decided it’s easier to clean our few throw rugs by shaking them outdoors and/or laundering them. We divide off each section of the house by closing the master-suite door and/or putting a laundry basket and small stool athwart the hall. This “blocking” worked well. We installed the charging station in the master suite, the only place where we could find free wall wide enough to satisfy the instructions. To vacuum the other sections, we “walk” Eufy to them, using the directional buttons on the remote control, while picking up any visible debris along the way. This takes less than two minutes. The Eufy is not fully programmable and seems to work at random, guided only by bumping into things (or not, if its sensors see walls or flat furniture surfaces first). It can be frustrating to watch it as it goes over the same ground repeatedly. But after leaving it alone for more time than we had patience to watch it, we have the impression that it covers most of the necessary ground. If it misses a spot, you can guide it there with the remote control or use the spiral-path “area” feature. We haven’t tried that yet, but the edge feature works like a charm to clean up nearly all the dust bunnies, which invariably hug a room’s edges. We also love watching it move effortlessly under beds, futons and tables to suck up the dust bunnies and crumbs there. Eufy bumps a bit over the edges of our saltillo tile, making a noise like a train on old-fashioned tracks, but we think the many small bumps will not harm it. When we’re ready to retire it or it’s done, we walk it back to the charging station the same way. Actually, it finds its way “home” from just a few feet from the charging station. But you have to be careful with walls: the charging station’s “here I am” radio signal apparently will go through sheetrock, causing Eufy to try to walk through walls. So far, we’ve run Eufy a little shy of two hours (not on its high-suction setting) without getting the breathing-orange “charge-me” signal. It seemed to slow down a bit toward the end, but not fatally. We’re happy so far with this procedure. With about five minutes of setup per section, that’s about a quarter-hour for the whole house (on three separate days). It saves us all the pushing, dragging and lifting of a much heavier machine—a welcome relief for seniors. And it cost about 150% of what we usually pay for a single professional, full-house cleaning. After we learned how to remove the dust bin, we haven’t had to lift Eufy at all. When Eufy gets through, the floors seem to have none of the fine grit and dust that sometimes remain even after professional cleaning. (We often walk around with bare feet inside, even in winter, as we have floor-based radiant heating.) Eufy’s micro-filter and dust bin are less than a tenth the size of those in full-sized vacuum cleaners. So it stands to reason they need to be cleaned far more often. We’ve marked page 18 in the manual, which contains the parts-cleaning schedule, and so far we’ve followed it religiously. We clean the dust bin in the garage, to avoid contaminating the house, and we use a soft-bristled new paint brush (1.5” wide) to clean the filters (especially the delicate HEPA clone). The paint brush seems to work better for the fine dust than the included brush. The only thing that can go wrong at this point is a breakdown. We’ll try to remember to edit this review if we have one. But if Eufy continues to work the way it has this first week, we’ll count it among our valuable basic appliances. UPDATE AFTER NEARLY THREE MONTHS We're still just as happy with Eufy as before, and we learned three useful things. First, Eufy got stuck under our shoe rack in the master-bedroom walk-in closet, so we now block it off. Second, Eufy's edge-cleaning mode is its most effective and useful, and it uses the most power, so we make it the first step in each section of our house. Then we do the random mode, with occasional look-ins. Finally we do manual touch-up and guide Eufy to the charging station manually, using the remote. Third, we like Eufy so much that we don't want any trouble, so we clean the rollers <i>and</i> the dust bin after every use. (Long hair on our bare floors tends to get caught in the rollers.) This takes about five minutes.","Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2019"
B07R295MLS,4,"Sleek, quiet and slimmer than my Roomba","I have a Roomba. The battery is failing. It's been great so I was looking for another. This Eufy was half the price of the cheapest Roomba and it was pretty well reviewed so I thought I'd give it a shot. It arrived packaged very well, documents were ok, set up was easy. Here's what I found. It's quiet so I can be in the same room when it's doing its' job. It's slim so it gets under things the Roomba doesn't. It's great on hard floors, ok on carpet but not as good as the Roomba on deep pile. It gets stuck where my Roomba gets stuck under the sofa but additionally has an issue with the base of my tower fan when the Roomba doesn't. It isn't connected to Wifi but that doesn't bother me. I have too many smart devices anyway and the Eufy has a remote that works well. So far the coolest thing is that when you order it home, it stops vacuuming and silently (well almost) speeds up looking for its' kennel. Oh yes it takes quite a while to charge. At least a couple of hours. But that charge lasts way longer than my Roomba - in fact it lasts for ages (I tried to time exactly how long but it was so long I got bored waiting for it to finish). So that's it; 4 stars. I'd give it 5 if it never got stuck and was better on carpet.","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,"Eufy 11S ""Max"" is a filter nightmare!!","The Eufy 11S Max is a joke!! Beware the filter system!! The filter on the 11S MAX gets clogged EVERY time you use it and it takes a while to clean it. Pretty labor intensive for every day use, If you will look at the filters, not only are they smaller than the 11S, they also have a plastic casing that makes the usable filter less effective. I am so disappointed I didn't realize this in time to return it. If you look at the 11S it has a screen over the filter to keep dirt from clogging the filter and a foam pad behind the filter to provide further filtration. This is the filtration system I had on previous robo vacs that worked so well. You would think the ""Max"" would provide something more than the 11S but its definitely inferior. The only ""max"" I see is their profits on these machines! I feel like the feedback on these must have included 11S. I'm chalking My ""Maxes"" (I bought two) up to live and learn and getting a couple of 11S model instead. Lot less labor intensive, Update: While I still feel my assessment of the 11S Max was accurate , my presentation was a little harsh. I was contacted by the seller and offered a full refund or a different model vacuum. My feedback is influenced a lot by the response of the seller. They were very apologetic and did offer two solutions. That means a lot in my book, when a company stand by their product, and that isn't the standard. Eufy does make excellent machines and they stand by their products. This one just happened to have a substandard filter system. Hopefully that will be addressed in future models.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,In a small house it is lasting the distance. Good performance under pressure.,"I have never had a combo mop/vac before. My shallow self is happy it runs way less noisy than my shark. So, so far? It does what it should and the app is pretty easy to use. I think for a house 1,200 sq ft or less with heavy pet traffic it should run well for at least a few good years and more with regular maintaining. It seems pretty well made. My shark after two years had a one piece rap where the front bumper was, which now meets in the middle, bowing like it is two pieces. Anyway, I have hope the C20 is less janky. Only time will tell. To restate, over all I like the design and the features work well so far.","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,"Changed the design, not as good","Unfortunately they have changed the design. Instead of two rotating spiral side brushes in front pushing dirt and animal hair towards the main suction brush there is only one. Also, the filter used to have the filter and a thing sponge layer to trap small dust particles which could be removed and cleaned, now the filter cannot be removed and the thin sponge is no longer there. I guess you could wash the filter, but obviously the design is to get you to buy replacement filters. I'll update once I used it to see if it works the same, however I mostly use it for cat hair and the two spiral side brushed were great at grabbing it and diverting to the main brush. Disappointed to say the least! Update Review a week later - the vaccuum cleans very well with the new design. I do wish the filter included the sponge fron the original design, but overall I am pleased and use it every day. For the price of this little vaccuum it does a great job on animal hair.

But if you’re looking for an affordable powerful self-emptying model at less than 300$, this is your guy. It works well with my dog’s coarse per hair, and my cat’s fine hair too (on wood floors).

B07R295MLS,4,RoboVac 11S vs. Dyson Ball,"If you prefer short simple reviews then scroll on. This is gonna be a long one. I’ll start my short story by sharing the stats of my house where the vacuum will be rolling around and cleaning up. Keep in mind that the Eufy RoboVac 11S is a low end model that may be more appropriate for a smaller house. Carpet: 600 sq feet Hardwood Floor: 590 sq feet Tile Floor: 250 sq feet 4 bedrooms, 2 baths, open living and dining room. I don’t have any pets or kids so it’s just me and my partner tracking dirt around the house. Before activating the robot vacuum I first vacuumed the house with my Dyson ball vacuum, which I’ve always been impressed with. I didn’t expect Rosie to pick up much on her maiden voyage around the house but I was proven wrong. I had to empty the bin twice during the first vacuum. To be fair, the Dyson can’t vacuum under the bed or under furniture whereas the Eufy vacuum just loves dark places to hide and chew on things that might get shoved under the bed. I recommend that you monitor this vacuum the first couple times it explores your house. You should treat it like a new puppy that hasn’t been house trained. If it finds a power cord laying on the floor it will wrestle with it, get tired of it, and then come back later to chew on it some more. The vacuums low profile also lets it vacuum under some chairs and it might get stuck trying to find its way out. I was nervous the first couple times I watched it roll full spread towards the stairs. It stops when it peaks over the edge and then turns around. This robot vacuum doesn’t map out your house like some of the expensive models so you should expect to see it vacuum some areas multiple times. It’s common to see it roam around a room for 15 minutes and make its way out only to turn around and go back in the same room to vacuum the whole thing again. I caught it fighting with one of my floor fans one day so I picked it up and walked it to the kitchen. I later went to check on it and found in had made its way back to the charging station to rest. The path that it takes seems random because I don’t see it getting stuck on the same things every day. It’s scheduled to vacuum each day for as long as the battery lasts. After the first couple days it’s not filling up the dust bin as much but it still vacuums up a lot of fine dust. There have been a few times when the battery has gone dead before it was able to make its way back to its charging stand. I’ve learned to tie up all the electric cables so that they don’t lay on the floor for Rosie to find. Every house is different so some people will encounter challenges that others would not. You’ll find that negotiations with robots goes nowhere so it will be your responsibility to make your house robot friendly. This vacuum isn’t as loud as most traditional stand up vacuums, but it is loud enough to be annoying. I work from home and have to shut the door to block out the noise. Fortunately it doesn’t claw at the door like pets do to get your attention. It finds other ways of doing that. I have caught the vacuum bumping up against the trash can in a grinding motion when it gets stuck on the foot peddle for the lid opener. The trash can is quite appealing with its shiny silver finish, but I honestly think the vacuum can do better. I literally have to push the two apart to get the vacuum refocused on cleaning the floor. It’s sensors don’t recognize black furniture or surfaces so it relies on the front bumper to deflect off dark objects. The vacuum’s sensor will detect white objects and automatically change direction before bumping into them. I wish this vacuum had gone through sensitivity training before leaving the warehouse. I got a really good deal on this vacuum, but now I kind of wish that I would have gotten the RoboVac 30C for its support of magnetic boundary strips. That feature would solve some of my challenges. So, a lot of people want to know if a RoboVac can replace your standard vacuum in regards to how well it cleans. I set my RobotVac loose to vacuum the floor every day for two weeks. I then cleaned out my Dyson DC41 real good and vacuumed the same rooms. I tried to give the Dyson an upper hand by picking up carpets and vacuuming inside of closets. I that that was only fair because the RoboVac goes under all the beds (more than needed). The Dyson gathered up two small hair balls and some super fine dust. I would normally fill the Dyson about a third of the collection bin for the same time period. I then took the Dyson down to the basement where the RoboVac dares not go and fed the beast. I left the Dyson in the basement which is sad because it really is a great vacuum. The RoboVac will eventually choke and then the Dyson will retake its rightful place back upstairs.","Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2019"
B07R295MLS,4,Easy setup,"Setup was easy, plug it in to charger and it’s ready to work. Cleaning pattern is random. It travels around my kitchen and living room willy nilly doing its job. Edge detection works good. Remote control does its job. I like that you can push the home button and it returns to its charger. I’ve blocked it from my bedrooms because the carpet is too thick. Living room is low pile and it works great. It’s pretty good at getting itself out of trouble but if it’s stuck it beeps for help.

B07R295MLS,4,A decent robotic vacuum,"The robot vacuums are the best! I live near the beach and have tile floor and these little guys run around and get all the sand that gets tracked in on a regular basis. I might be concerned EUFY/ scratch hardwood floors but no issues EUFY/ the tile My original Roomba 870 finally broke the top sensor that, unfortunately, acted like a hook, which kept getting caught under the kitchen counter lip. After about 2.5 years of letting it struggle to free itself from under the lip, it broke and stripped out the wires. I decided not to try and repair and just search for a new Roomba or So, I did some searching of all brands and models and decided on the EUFY primarily for cost and noise level. Environment - * No kid's messes or pet hair to deal with. * As mentioned, we live EUFY/in about a mile of the beach and it's surprising how much sand ends up in your home EUFY/ the windows open, even if you aren’t always going to the beach. * Tile floor with a few scattered rugs. Thoughts so far - Good - 1. Noise Level - SIGNIFICANTLY quieter than the Roomba. I can actually hear something besides the cleaner. 2. The lower profile of the EUFY does a better job at cleaning the floor. 3. EUFY does carpeting better than the Roomba although EUFY/ one drawback, the type of spinning brush used by EUFY, details below. The EUFY is like a bull in a china shop, just keeps pushing over the carpeting while Roomba would mostly avoid it altogether, seeing it as an edge and would just go around it. Occasionally it would get on the carpet and just stall. 4. Battery life has been very good so far, runs about 1.5 – 2 hours on a regular charge. The Roomba was just all over the place, 20 minutes some days, and an hour others. The good battery life is what I would expect from Anker. 5. Lower profile - The Roomba has a notch/sensor on top, which gets caught at various points under anything low hanging like cabinets, which are uneven. It can sometimes work itself out but sometimes it just stops trying and needs to be moved. I like the lower EUFY profile EUFY/ no notch on top; it's able to get under a lot of spaces EUFY/o any issues that the Roomba didn’t even try. 6. Dual Brushes - just like that it can attack corners from both front angles. 7. Dark rugs - The Roomba ALWAYS had issues EUFY/ a dark rug and stalled EUFY an error code. This seems to be a common issue EUFY/ some of the floor vacuums but I've had no issues EUFY/ EUFY on the same rug. 8. Doesn't bully the furniture. The Roomba was notorious for pounding anything on the floor and actually, over time, moving things around. Have a metal stand that the Roomba's top notch would get caught on. This either stopped the Roomba altogether or it would move the stand to the middle of the room before leaving it behind. 9. I like the remote. I have my EUFY parked under a TV stand so it’s out of the way and, for the most part, unseen. If I want to have it run the apartment again, I would have to reach under the stand to start the Roomba’s top button. With the EUFY, I can grab the remote and press a button. Very simple. I think the convenience of the remote allows for the EUFY to be hidden. Not so good - 1. The brushes are full-length bristles and twice it's gotten tangled in itself while over carpeting (picture included) which has halted EUFY completely. I think the Roomba type brush EUFY/ the bristles at the very ends works better and prevents it from getting caught up inside itself. Also, they keep popping off, sometimes in the wrong places (deep under the couch), and have to be located and put back on. 2. I feel like the EUFY struggles in small spaces, having a hard time finding it's way out. My bed is close to a dresser; just enough space to get between but it struggles to get out. It will work itself mostly out and turn around and head right back in for a few iterations until it finally frees itself. 3. I miss being able to schedule per day instead of just a time, which then runs everyday EUFY/o the days option. 4. I don’t like that the cover that houses the cleaning filters comes off. I like that the Roomba’s cover is hinged. As mentioned, twice the cover came off completely. 5. The roller brush ends don’t come off. The issue is that longer hair gets trapped at the ends, in the groove between the end of the brush and the brush itself. This makes it difficult to get long hairs, wrapped in that groove, off. Roomba’s ends are smaller and that collection of hair just pulls right off. (Roomba pictures included, yellow end compared to EUFY's (blue/black)). 6. EUFY struggles EUFY/ the light. If the windows/door allow any decent amount of light in, it treats that as an obstacle.","Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2019"
B07R295MLS,4,Not bad,"Not a bad little vacuum for the price. Battery died after a year and had to replace it. Think it's dying again, it'll start and stop in a few minutes and just blink red, about $30.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,"Good value for the money, with some quirks","I picked this particular model after some week of research and comparisons. This was reviewed/advertised as a cheaply priced robo vacuum that still added some more advanced features. (I bought this in 2019 for just over $200) And that's exactly what you get. It has some quirks, but once you understand them it is fairly simple to let it just do its job. Obviously, clothes, papers, and other such things should be removed from the floor. Cords should be tucked away or at least secured firmly enough that the brushes cannot get under/behind them to tangle up. Yes, as a cheaper model it doesn't vacuum in a precise grid, but what appears to be random bouncing around isn't so random as you might expect. It will follow the edges of a room, and while doing the center, the ""random"" direction changes always seem to hit a spot it hadn't yet reached. It's still not a very efficient way to go about it, but at least you can be reasonably assured that it's not just hitting some spots multiple times and missing others. The mapping software itself seems pretty good too, though there are a few areas that give it problems. Rocking chairs, where it can get underneath the rocker, seem to throw off its mapping, making it not sure how close the chair actually is. Other things (a tv stand, for instance) that are raised slightly, yet not quite enough for it to fit under, seem to have a similar effect. However, it only takes a couple passes before it gets a reasonable idea of the position, and moves on. Indeed, it seems to need only three passes to map the majority of the house. And if something frustrates the mapping software, it will often move on to the next room and come back later, to make its second, better attempt. Having watched the first couple runs in their entirety, I could see it slowly learning how to better navigate my home. The one spot it can't seem to figure out at all is the kitchen chairs. My particular chairs have legs spaced wide enough for the vacuum to fit between, and so it can get all the way underneath the chairs and table. And while this is a bit of a maze, if it can get in it will eventually work itself out, even if it takes a bit. However, even if I pull the chairs out, something about them still seems to throw it off, and it will bang its head on these chairs repeatedly, and come back to it as many times as you'll let it (unlike most other obstacles, it never seems to hit the ""this are clean"" threshold, and seems to think under these chairs is permanently dirty.) The standard obstacles (carpets, door jams, drops) it navigates as well as advertised, and you can watch it learn to stop less than an inch from walls and furniture where it's already mapped the room, and then follow the edges. And while the suction power is indeed very good, it is at the center of the vacuum, and the brushes for reaching the edges only seem to have a moderate effectiveness. While it is adequate for day-to-day care, you will probably want a vacuum with attachment to clean the edges of the room in an occasional deep-cleaning. The brushes of course, tangle with long hair, but that is true for most vacuums, and as long as you keep up with clearing that, you shouldn't have issues. Short hair, from people and even pets, don't give it any problems at all. My short-haired cat's hair was easily and quickly cleaned up. The filter and dustbox do fill up faster than a standard vacuum. For a small, 900 sq ft home, a full cleaning will likely fill the dustbox. Luckily, it is very easy to remove and empty, but having to do this almost every time you run the vacuum is one of the sacrifices of going cheaper. Even so, with any obstacles removed, that is up to an hour and a half of vacuuming done with little-to-no supervision. And there are other features to make up for it. The remote has buttons for multiple cleaning modes. You can set it in a room, close the door, and set it single room clean. You can set it in a specific spot and press spot-clean, and it will move within a few square feet repeatedly, for isolated messes. You can select edge clean to make it follow the edges of the rooms only. It can be programmed to run at specific times, and will return to the charger itself when its battery runs low. It has a start/stop button and a manual return to base button. Overall, while it's not a perfect replacement,for manual vacuum, it should greatly reduce the amount of time you spend on it. And for those who can't afford the high-end robo vacuums, it is a very good compromise. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2020"
B07R295MLS,4,Works really well.,"Pro: My first robot vacuum. I love that it does not connect to the internet. There is no good reason for an appliance to connect to the internet. It cleans well. Has cut way down on the daily sweeping chore. I really like that it goes under the furniture (most of my furniture). Easy to empty and I do so when it occurs to me and is convenient to do so. It has yet to ""ask me"" to be emptied. I probably do it once a week or so when doing other chores. Quietest vacuum I've ever had (though also the smallest). Con: Doesn't get all the way into the corners, so one has to weep the corners out once in a while. Can get stuck under some furniture (in my case where I have a tapered toe kick board under a book case that it can sometimes wedge itself into). Has problems with electric cords and strings. Keep your space picked-up (just like Mommy told you to (in fairness, one has to do that for a regular vacuum as well)).

The ""con"" is that we typically only get about a year out of these. We run it daily and my family is not great about picking up socks and other things that can get sucked into it, so we are probably pretty hard on them.

B07R295MLS,4,It works remarkably well... I love it...,"I recently moved from a small room in a ""Granny Flat"" rental to a larger Master Bed/Bath in a new house... As I was vacuuming my old room in the ""Granny Flat"", I was surprised how long it took my upright Eureka vacuum to clean the small room I was vacating. Since the Master Bed/Bath I was moving into was at least 3X the square footage of my old room, I decided to buy a robot vacuum. When I first moved in, I emptied, and thoroughly vacuumed the new room, and the Eureka picked up quite a bit of hair/dust/stuff before I settled in. I spent a lot of time reading Amazon reviews and watching YouTube reviews before making the purchase decision. I didn't need a truly ""smart"" robot vacuum, I didn't need a vacuum that used an App, but the the Eufy fit my needs b/c it had a shorter profile than other comparable robot vacuums and could get under my dressers/desks and assorted furniture. The Eufy arrived and it was basically ""plug & play"", nothing really to program except the time on the remote. I ran the Eufy and it covered the entire room/bed/bath and I was amazed how much dust/dirt/hair it picked up even after I had used my upright Eureka to vacuum the room. I programmed the remote to vacuum every morning at 10:15AM (when I am usually gone), and I came home each day, again surprised by how much dirt/dust/hair it picked up! I read another review that mentioned the timer programming was a problem, and I experienced that too. Although I set/programmed the Eufy to clean at 10:15AM, it continued to start cleaning at 10:15PM... so I just changed the program to start cleaning at 10:15PM - problem solved... it starts cleaning each day at 10:15AM... First-World Problems... I've been using the Eufy every day now for 2 months. As it continues to clean every day, the collection bin has less and less dirt/dust/hair almost every day. I come home, slide out the collector tray and empty it and brush the filters clean every day as part of my routine when I arrive home, it takes 30 seconds... My prior small room was difficult to move around in due to the amount of furniture I had crammed into it, hence, I didn't bother vacuuming very much, and when I vacated the premises, it showed. Moving into a larger space, I was determined to not have to vacuum on an ad hoc basis and let the Eufy take care of it on a daily basis, it was one of the best Amazon purchase decisions I have made. My room/bathroom is approximately 300 square feet, the Eufy vacuums the space every day, my room/bathroom is quite clean, the suction power of the Eufy does remarkably well, the beater bar and the side brushes get into almost every nook and cranny. I'd give it 5 stars except for the following: I have a carpet in the bathroom that has a few ""stray"" threads that stick out. The beater bar or the side-brushes on the Eufy will sometimes tangle up in these and the Eufy gets stuck, runs out of battery power and shuts down, (allegedly the Eufy ""senses"" this and shuts down while tangled up so as to not burn out the motors) when I get home and find it tangled up, I un-tangle it, set it back on the charging station and it works fine. Next, I have an ottoman that sits right at the 2-1/2"" height of the Eufy, I came home today and the Eufy was stuck under the ottoman, apparently the automatic shut-off when it gets stuck works b/c when I removed it and pressed the start button, it immediately started back up and resumed cleaning the room. Yet despite it's really low profile and it's ability to get under most furniture, my particular ottoman is just too low for it to fit under, so it gets stuck.

B07R295MLS,4,Long lasting,This is the 3rd one that I’ve gotten for my mom. She has 2 cats and loves it. They last about 2 years at her place.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,Great for the price!,"Set up was very easy. Read the instructions, which were clear. I did *not* have the recommended 3 feet on either side for the base because we have a small old farm house with minimal electric outlets. I have a stretch of wall that's 3 and 1/2 feet total with an outlet there. I set up the base in the center of that initially. Blanche (as I've named her) couldn't dock. I played with it, moving it to one side or other and doing docking test runs. Finally got her to dock just fine with 1 foot clear on the left side (as facing) and 2 and 1/2 foot on right side. I did have the 6 foot clearance in front. So you can play around with it and get it to work if you don't have the full space required. Noticed a problem right away - my floors are wood, and the base is VERY light weight. Blanche found her way to dock fine after finding the right spot, but then would just push the base around. I set the base back in the spot and taped it down with a strip of clear packing tape. After that, success every time. Blanche took about 6 hours to charge fully initially. I've set her to work every day for about a week, and she's usually fully charged after a couple hours now. Unfortunately, we are unable to use the little round sweeper brushes on her because they do not attach, they just set on. I have many rugs around the house, and the little brushes just fall off when she transitions from wood floor to rug. This makes it difficult for Blanche to get the edges of the room clean (without the round sweeper brushes), but she does a great job otherwise. Suction power is strong. The dirt tray is big enough to do my entire house (kitchen, dining, living room, den, laundry room, and bathroom) twice before needing changed. And we have cats and dogs. Speaking of cats and dogs, they are not impressed. The dog is actually terrified of Blanche, and for now I have to put her (the dog) upstairs when I run her. Otherwise, she runs around the house yelping, barking, and shaking. Three of the four cats sit on the couch and watch Blanche, and hop to other furniture when she nears. The fourth cat, who is 25years old, follows Blanche around like house security, not letting her out of her sight. Blanche transitions from wood to thick rugs great, other than the sweepers falling off. She also jumps the lip between the dining room and kitchen with ease, and it's more than 1/2 inch (as I said, old farm house). She high centers on the tile corner of an old wood stove platform, but after a minute or so gets herself out just fine. I did notice that the drop sensor on her front side gets dirty, and she then marches in place, inching to and fro, making disgruntled noises until I clean it. It's easy to clean, but hard to remember. Not to worry, Blanche keeps me posted. Then I just wipe with a dry cloth. Would like to be able to use the round sweeper brushes, but still very happy with not having to sweep my floors twice a day. Now I just go around the edges with the broom once in the morning and swipe the dust and hair out where Blanche can reach it, and she picks it up later. This is a super slim model, and fits under my couches - which I LOVE, and is the reason I chose this over other models. It does not, unfortunately, fit between my dining chairs. My table seats 10 and always has 8 chairs - four on either side. Blanch can't get under the table, so while I'm moving dust from the edges, I swipe the dust out from under the dining table so she can reach it. All in all, this has been a great purchase for the price. Thrilled with Blanche so far. It has only been a week, though, so we'll have to see how we get along after living together for a while. If the relationship sours, will update this review.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2020"
B07R295MLS,4,Not bad,"Boy there's so many things to say. First I appreciate the fast shipping from the seller and the item was well packed. The best way to review this is to take it point by point. Cons 1. This vacuum is no more quiet than the shark vacuum I had had for years. It's not exceptionally quiet and if I'm on the phone I actually have to stop it so that I can hear better. 2. This vacuum doesn't seem to be dedicated to a room or rooms in particular. What I mean is my shark vacuum did bounce around in verticals diagonals etc., But it seemed to like to stay in one particular room for a while then go to another one, and so forth. This vacuum beep bops around going all over the place. 3. This vacuum does not recognize magnetic boundary strips and is powerful enough to climb up the base of a pedestal stand ultimate getting stuck. It would be far better if it would recognize the magnetic boundary strips like my shark vacuum did. 4. Does not work in conjunction with an app and cannot be controlled via voice or your phone. Regarding the cons, you pretty much get what you pay for and I was looking for a relatively low-cost vacuum. Pros 1. This vacuum is controlled by a remote control which it first didn't seem all that great, but I've come to realize it's extremely helpful. 2. The remote control pretty much works like a remote control car with the directionals. It's nice to be able to back it up if need be. However they're remote control will also control the intensity of the vacuum suction which has three levels. In addition you can tell the vacuum to stay in one relative area and it will circle and circle expanding the circle to ensure that all the dirt is picked up. This remote control will also allow you to tell the vacuum to go back to the docking station. Furthermore you can program the vacuum to go begin vacuuming any particular time. However it will not allow you to set what days you want to vacuum or not. This is not a big deal to me because I like it to run everyday. 3. This vacuum will also turn sharp corners and work along edges. With remote control you can tell the vacuum to either do edging, concentrate an area, or just go willy-nilly. 4. The vacuum has a low profile so it's excellent for getting under furniture. 5. The docking station footprint is small not bulky like some. 6. Even though the vacuum does not recognize boundary strips it knows when it's nearest step and will turn around. 7. So far this vacuum has had no trouble finding its docking station. My shark vacuum always seem to get lost on its way home. It was like a bad puppy I had to keep pushing it and pushing it to go work needs to go. 8. If this vacuums battery runs low during the specified runtime (likely due to suction power settings), it will return to the docking station and recharge then begin to finish his vacuuming. All in all it's a pretty good vacuum for the price. Keep in mind that this is not meant to deep clean your carpets basically this is surface dirt on carpeting. It has an excellent job on the hardwood floors which most of my home is. This vacuum makes life easier because I don't have to lift the furniture or push furniture all the way anymore to get underneath it. So if you're looking for a robot vacuum for a reasonable price to do the everyday vacuuming then this is a good one for you.","Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2023"

B07R295MLS,4,Improved since Robo Vac's from 3 Years Ago,"This is essentially the same vacuum as the Deebot N97S, but a newer, improved version of it. Our N97S is just over 3 years old. We use the bot mostly to clean up the dog hair and to try to keep it minimally noticeable (our dog sheds about 3-4 full loads of the 11S dust bin every day--so it's a lot of 1-2 inch long dog hairs). The suction on this 11S model is sufficient to pick up 95%+ of the dog fur from both the hardwood floors and from the carpet, along with the dirt and sand that the dog brings in with his paws. There is now a little wheel on the back of the dust bin along with a heavy glass top plate that keeps the bot from ""bouncing"" as it sweeps across our medium shag carpet (the N97S is lighter and doesn't have the wheel, and thus it ""hops"" along on the carpet, so it doesn't do as good of a job on the carpet). Navigation is improved, so the 11S doesn't get stuck in the difficult to navigate locations that the N79S gets stuck in. The 11S also does not bump into objects as fast/hard as the N79S does, to the 11S is gentler on our wood furniture (the N79S has put scratches around some of the legs). The 11S is noticeably quieter than the N79S, both in the loudness of the vacuum motor as well as the noise of the propulsion motors and mechanics. For example, we had to increase the volume of the TV by double when the N79S was running, but only by 10-20% when the 11S is running. The 11S doesn't have WiFi (where the N79S does have WiFi), but the WiFi is a feature we never really made use of as the functionality is no better than the remote control and reaction time-delay through WiFi makes directional control of the N79S thru WiFi nearly useless. There are several other small design improvements on the 11S (power button on the bottom instead of the side where random things on the floor would turn the N79S off--and there is a rubber cover over the bottom power button to keep things on the floor from turning the power off), the main brush is better designed for picking up dirt and fur and takes much longer to foul the brush with fur than with the N79S, etc. Overall, there are a number of design improvements, and the overall cleaning ability (in particular picking up dog hair/fur) has improved noticeably. So, a good time to purchase a new bot with the old one being just over 3 years old. Note that we bought the 11S based on Consumer Reports reviews of several bots and based on battery life vs. suction power and pet hair cleaning. We have 2 N79S's, and the main brush motor on one of them failed, plus the batteries were only holding a charge for 20-30 minutes (down from 90 minutes when they were new). It was about equal in price to buy a replacement main brush motor, new battery, new main brush, and main brush door (the rubber gasket had worn off) versus buying a whole new robot. We are continuing to use the remaining N79S (with a new, 20% longer lasting battery which gives almost 2 hours of run time; and a new main brush) and hang on to the non-functional N79S to be used for spare parts for the working N79S. When we run out of spare parts, we'll recycle what remains of the N79S's and buy another bot--hopefully one that will unload its dust bin when it gets full rather than having to empty the 11S and N79S dust bins about every 20 minutes when they're full of dog hair.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2021"

B07R295MLS,4,"Overall good, but gets stuck often","We have had this vacuum for over a year and overall really like it. It does pick up an amazing amount of dirt that you didn’t even know was there. The bin is relatively small and probably can only handle about three days worth of dirt depending on if you have animals or not. It gets stuck quite often on the legs of the recliners so I had to build guards for it to bump against and not try to climb up. It finds its way back to the base, 8/10 times. The battery lasts about 1.5 hours of cleaning. It does not have any sort of online mapping or anything like that just a remote that is somewhat programmable. Overall, I would buy this again for what I paid for it but now there are other options that are in the same price range that have the automatic dust removal bin, mop, and other options.","Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,"I know I'm giving this vacuum cleaner four stars, but honestly, I love it","I've been using this vacuum cleaner for about two months. Here's what I think are important details: --It's great! I was surprised by how well it pulled pet hair off the carpets. Did I mention I have six dogs? I have six dogs. I LOVED how well this vacuum cleaner performed. --However, its performance on carpet did decline over the two months. Then it started making a very loud noise while running, especially on hard surfaces; I contacted the company; after a bit of going back and forth, they sent me a replacer roller brush. Boom, instant solution for the noise AND the performance on the carpet is back to where it was to begin with. I hope there are roller brushes I can buy separately, because I would be happy to replace the brush every two months to keep the performance high. --It's quiet, except see above, there was this temporary problem with the roller brush. But ordinarily it's quiet! --It's easy to clean all the parts, but you should take your time to figure out how to take out the filters and take everything apart. The filter compartment opens from the top AND the dust container opens at the side. I didn't see how to take out the filters at first. The filters are really good because this machine picks up tons of dust. There's a gravel road by my house, so wow is there a lot of dust. This vacuum cleaner gets all that off the floor. I'm dying for a flying version that dusts horizontal surfaces all over the house. --The little tool that comes with the vacuum cleaner has a tiny little razor blade, very useful for cleaning the pet hair off the roller. I didn't realize that at once either so I was using a little scissors, but it's a great tool once you realize there's a razor blade attached to it. I personally found it necessary to clean the roller brush twice during a cleaning period at first. That thing really picks up pet hair. After the first week, I could just clean the pet hair off the roller brush before each use and that was enough. --The vacuum cleaner does go back to its charger almost all the time. Every now and then it will almost make it, but not quite. This is no problem since I just put the vacuum cleaner on the charger the next time I walk down that hallway. The charger power cord is very thin. I have the charger downstairs, where the dogs aren't allowed without supervision, because puppy teeth would clip through a cord that thin in jig time. It's no problem at all to bring the vacuum cleaner upstairs every day and then take it down again. It's very light and easy to carry. Overall, I love this vacuum cleaner. Love it! I definitely think you should try it if you're hesitating to buy a really expensive model. Very much worth the price.","Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2023"
B07R295MLS,4,Eufy 11s vs ECOVACS DEEBOT N79S - Not even close!,"If you just want to cut straight to the chase, I have tried both robo-vac's, and the Eufy 11s is HANDS DOWN better than the DEEBOT N79S. Prices for both vacuum's fluctuate, with the Eufy usually being slightly more, but it is worth every penny! If you're going to spend this much money on a vacuum, you might as well get one that you'll be happy with. If you want an explanation as to why, continue reading. Background: I have owned my Eufy 11s for just over 6 months now. I am very happy with it for the most part, and will go into more detail about it later. More recently I decided to purchase a robo-vac as a Christmas present for my parents, and settled on the DEEBOT N79S (mainly because at the time it was $75 less than the Eufy, and seemed to have comparable reviews/features). I visited my parents during Christmas, and was there for the unavailing of the N79S. Initial impression is the two companies have obviously copied each other in design (not sure who copied who). They are almost identical in sensor setup, charging method, bumpers, brushes, control features, and just overall design and look. However, when it comes to execution, the two are vastly different. Upon starting up the N79S, I could immediately tell it was less powerful than the Eufy, both in suction and in its ability to move. On bare hardwood and tile it was fine, but as soon as it hit the first low-pile rug, it was instantly bogged down. A few times it bounced off of the rug and turned around after it struggled to get over the seam. Other times, it made it onto the rug but was barely moving, it just didn't seem to have the power to overcome the resistance. The struggle continued when the DEEBOT made it to the low-pile carpet in the bedrooms, it could hardly move. Again, we're talking very thin stuff, I have the same thickness of rugs and carpet at home and the Eufy handles them easily. Further, the N79S only has 1,000 Pa of suction, as compared with 1,300 Pa of suction on the Eufy (just know that this difference seems to make a significant difference). DEEBOT N79S The Good: Price Does okay on hard wood and tile The Bad: Can't handle anything accept wood or tile Suction Power 1,000 Pa, vs 1,300 of Eufy Wheel Power (ability to maneuver over high friction surfaces) Debris Bin Size - smaller than Eufy Noise - 5dB louder than Eufy Profile (height) - Eufy ~0.25"" shorter In my opinion, those are critical features. The only advantage I can think the DEEBOT has is a WiFi function that allows it to be controlled through an app on your phone rather than the remote that comes with the vacuum. This is more of a ""bell and whistle"" feature, and doesn't actually add any value to the overall performance. Eufy 11s: First of all it isn't perfect, but then again it's also 1/3 of the cost of the premium vacuum's, so can you really complain? It is amazing for picking up dog and animal hair. The perimeter function that follows the border of your rooms (the DEEBOT has this as well) works extremely well, and picks up a lot of dust stuck along baseboards. Its low profile really comes in handy with getting under most furniture, and going where a normal vacuum couldn't. The Good: Suction Battery life Mobility (ability to go below/around objects) Can handle low-pile carpets Large dust bin Durability The Bad: Doesn't always return to its docking station after a run. Roller brush get's stuck with dog hair and needs to be cleaned ~ once a week. Sometimes gets stuck under rocking furniture, such as recliners. Still loud enough that I only run it at night or when I'm away, never while watching TV (as they suggest you can). In summary, I just got done printing out the return label for the DEEBOT, and I'm ordering my parents a Eufy... *UPDATE* I just tried to leave this exact same review (but with a 2 star rating) on the DEEBOT N79S page and Amazon blocked the submission saying, ""Sorry, we are unable to accept reviews for this product. This product has limitations on submitting reviews. There can be a number of reasons for this, including unusual reviewing activity"". I would be weary of the overall DEEBOT average review rating. Seems like something fishy is going on here.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2019"
B07R295MLS,4,An amazing starter robovac,"I've always wanted to try one of these but the Roomba is so expensive, I could never foresee myself purchasing one. Then I saw these. I figured I'd give it a shot. It was under 200 dollars. The price wasn't insane. As soon as it arrived, I felt like I'd made a mistake. This is an insane luxury! It will never work! I was disheartened to read I needed some ridiculous 6 feet of clearance either side of the charging port. I live in a small apartment. I don't have 6 feet of free space period! I planned on returning this pronto, but I set it up and let it charge. What did I have to lose? My husband and I tried it the next night after the kids went to bed. We put it on auto mode and watched it run over the same spot 3 times in under 5 minutes. I wasn't impressed. I went to take a shower and left my husband to play with the novelty toy I'd picked up (the Eufy). When I came out though, I was surprised. The area rug in the living room looked pretty clean. We let it run on its own. I started to change my mind. My husband showed me how to use the different modes on the remote to help it do a better job. It can do a spiral from the center of the room, it can do edges, it can do auto mode, where it just roams around endlessly... I tried the directional buttons to control it and swept up a few spots it missed. It's like a remote control car for adults. It doesn't go fast and all it does it picks up dust and hair, but hey! I'm 30! That's exciting for me! We started a *manual* routine. After the kids are in bed or it's nap time, we pick up and start the vacuum from the bedroom. I go out to the living room and wait for it. It finishes the bedroom, which it has no problems at. It sweeps under the bed beautifully and we've blocked off areas we don't want it to go into. It comes down the hall, the kid's room is usually shut. I do their room on its own when they are out of the house. I pick up their room, put the vacuum inside and shut the door. When I come back, clean! I don't let it go in the bathroom. It doesn't like the shag microfiber rugs in there. Once it's in the living room, I mostly let it do its thing. i direct it around spots it misses and get high traffic areas, but mostly, I watch TV or work on my computer. Once I'm satisfied and I'm always satisfied, my hardwood apartment has never EVER looked this clean, I direct it back to the bedroom and hit home. It can't find the charger unless it's in the same room. Its slightly disappointing, but I'm ok with it. We set up the charger so the vacuum finds it once it's within a reasonable distance so I'm satisfied. You should empty the canister every time you use it. Tape area rugs down, because it does get stuck on them. Don't let it get at cords, tuck them behind furniture or block off the area physically. I do not like using the timer. The house has to free of obstructions for this the vacuum to do a good job and with two young kids, I rarely clean on a schedule. I need to pick up anyway though, so this really motivates me. When I have time, I pick up the apartment, sit down, and watch as my floor is vacuumed. I love it. Love it. Love it. And I think when we get a biger place, I will invest in a model that can empty itself, can map the floor plan, and that can connect to google home. I'm a little sad this doesn't have smart capabilities, but as I said, it's an excellent starter vac. I don't think I want to live without one anymore. Thank you Eufy for taking my robo virginity! lol I am totally sold. I am keeping this little baby! I included a video of it returning to the charging dock... without the recommended distance.

B07R295MLS,4,"Good, but maybe not for long haired shedding pets","I recently moved from a mostly carpeted apartment to a home with all hardwood/tiled floor. Until now, I never realized how bad my dog’s shedding was. It’s suddenly all over everything. Before where the carpet would grab onto any loose hairs, it’s taking over furniture and our clothes and just about everything else in the house. I used to get by vacuuming, well, maybe not as often as I should honestly, but in the first few days of living here it became clear that I wouldn’t be able to get away with that, but I simply couldn’t keep up. I quickly purchased one of the first affordable robot vacuums I saw. Here’s what you should know if you also have a dog with long, thick fur… - way more hair gets wrapped around the brush than actually gets picked up and sucked into the canister. I have to clean the brush every time before I turn it on. I can’t just turn it on and walk away. The design does make it super easy to clean though and it includes a nifty little tool with a blade that breaks up the hair, but it’s annoying to have to do every time I need to vacuum. If I don’t do this, it will stop running and tell me the brush is stuck and needs to be cleaned. This kind of makes the automatic scheduling useless to me since I have to “prepare” the vacuum first every time - biggest drawback for me is the random little deposits of fur it likes to leave around on the floor. See the attached picture. Even with daily cleaning of the brush like I mentioned above… it will be running and be fine for several minutes but then it seems to not be able to grab onto all the hair (BECAUSE IT ALL GETS STUCK IN THE BRUSH and then there’s too much buildup) so once there’s a buildup of too much hair that won’t wrap around the brush, it’s just like “I’ve had enough” I guess, and then lets go of all the excess hair I wonder if all this would still happen no matter the vacuum I got. My girl sheds religiously, I’d be surprised if there IS a vacuum that can keep up. But I thought I’d still make a review about it because I don’t remember seeing one like this when I purchased. If it weren’t for all my pet fur spawning all over the place, I wouldn’t suspect that there was anything wrong with this little robot. It does do its job really well to clean. It does take a while (like 2 hours for my 1025 square foot home lol) but who cares, it’s vacuuming for you and you get to just sit there. I would definitely recommend this to someone without thick and long haired pets. If their dog is anything like mine though I probably wouldn’t","Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2023"
B07R295MLS,4,Works well but has a few drawbacks,"I’ve used this product for a couple weeks now and I’ll start by saying that it is worth its money and does a decent job. Would I purchase it again…not sure at this point. But I wouldn’t say I’m dissatisfied with it. The drawbacks are: It does not have a handle to pick it up with which seems trivial but that’s an inconvenience to me. The only function without the remote is start/stop using the button on the vacuum itself so to run a spot clean, for example, you have to pick up the remote. It struggles with some clay cat litter on tile or slick floors and will scatter it. And there is no option for a room divider/wall barrier device. Some pros are that it is really quiet, low profile is great, and it will work on a rug with some black in it. All in all it is fine for what I use a robot vacuum for.","Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,Does adequate job for my needs,"First off: This will NOT clean your whole house in the 60 minute run-time that it has, unless you have a small 2-3 room home/apartment. My home is around 1800 square feet and I use this to clean family room, kitchen, 2 bedrooms and one tiny bathroom and I have to alternate days to clean sections of home or single rooms because of the limited run-time. I am OK with this. It does a surprisingly good job of getting up dust, dirt pet hair and small debris. I am amazed at how much debris is in the dust bin after cleaning only one room! It is much quieter than I thought it would be--a definite plus, as my cat (who is petrified of upright vacuum) has no issue with this when it is running. It is relatively easy to clean and maintain. It is a bit inefficient in that it wanders, criss-crossing about and sometimes missing small areas and cleaning others more than once. In general, this is a minor issue in my home. You will have to prep the area to be cleaned: closing doors, using barriers to prevent it from entering into unwanted territory, removing barriers that can complicate/impede it's path and getting cords out of the way. I have a swivel/glider chair with a round metal base underneath it and I have to roll up a bath towel and place it in the space between bottom of chair and floor. Otherwise, Eufy will creep under and get hung up in the metal and turn herself off. All in all, I am glad I bought this and love using it. I am older, and pushing around an upright is hard on my back and shoulders and hard to get into and under the small spaces, which Eufy is able to do.","Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2024"

B07R295MLS,4,Not impressed/edit: it's ok,"I've only had it for one day. I set the timer for 7:00 in the morning, I was at work when it ran. Came home on lunch and it was stuck. After getting it unstuck and blocking off the path to where it couldn't go that way I restarted it. Ended up with a dead battery underneath the bed not hung up on anything. It is relatively quiet, but it is a vacuum after all so it's not totally quiet. It seemed to pick up quite a bit of the animal hair off the parts of the floor it did vacuum. I was under the impression that you could use an app with this one but you can't. It does come with a remote that is relatively easy to learn. I'm hoping that the next few days he makes it back to his charger without having to be placed there and actually cleans. If not I'm going to have to return him and find a different one. Edit: For the last 10 days it's made it to it's charging base with the exception of getting high centered on cords a couple of times. It's seems to get the floors cleaned, the trash receptacle needs emptied every couple days. We have a dog and a cat so plenty of hair to clean up. It's still kinda quiet.","Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,eufu 11s Review,"Like most people who are using this kind of product, I attempted to do an enormous amount of research into my different options. I was focused on the <$300 price point and wanted to get the one that was the best for the money. I was going to buy this or the Deebot 79s, and on the day I went to decide, the price on the Eufy was dropped to $150.00 so it seemed like a no brainer. I had a litany of concerns about this product, especially since it didn't have any actual navigational abilities. Our doorstairs area is fairly large and has a table/chairs, island in the kitchen, couch/love seat, and a long hallway leading back to an office. It seemed like it would be pretty hard for a vacuum without navigational memory to hit all of these spots on a regular basis. How is the actual vacuum? Does it pickup things on the ground? Yes -- mostly. It's actually kind of weird because there are definitely moments where it misses the thing on the floor that you can absolutely see as it goes. But then you go to empty the lint trap at the end of it's run and it's completely full. Does it get stuck often? Does it return to it's home base to charge? I've run it 5x in my house and it's gotten stuck twice, but like I said, we have a lot of obstacles in my house. I think this is actually pretty good considering it runs for almost 2 hours. As far as returning back to the charging base.... It has not failed to make it back yet, but man, it takes it a LONG time to figure out how to get back there. When the battery gets low it turns off the vacuum portion and it just slides around trying to get to the base. You'd think it would head in that general direction, but it really just seems to keep going in random circles until it gets REALLY close and then docks itself. It's really odd, but it works, so hard to complain. Is it easy to clean? The biggest complaint so far about this product is that it requires you empty the bin everytime it runs. There is definitely something to say that you have to empty the bin every time, occasionally make sure the bot gets unstuck, etc. Given that it runs for 2 hours and it doesn't take nearly 2 hours to vacuum my downstairs, one might argue that you aren't saving as much time as you might think. Does it vacuum everything? Or does it go over the same area over and over? I think this is where it really impressed me. It does bump into things and change courses quite randomly, but it really tries to get a wide variety of area as it runs. It can detect when it's up against a corner of a leg of a chair and them kind of spins around that area trying to get everything it can. It also moves in incremental ways when it gets stuck to make sure that it stays close to walls and creases when it can. My house has a small rug that it goes over easily and a quite heavy duty rug that it climbs on without issue. Overall impressions: For the money and what I was looking for, this product is pretty nice. I can't imagine how spending $500+ on one could be worth it, as I just don't think the overall quality of the vacuum could be any better. If you are looking for a product that is hands off and you never need to vacuum again, this isn't it. But if you want something to run once or twice a week to get pet hair and dust, and make your house feel cleaner, it's pretty darn cool.","Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2019"
B07R295MLS,4,Not the smartest but still great!,"All in all its pretty decent. I have an Australian Shepard that sheds enough to make pillows out of her fur and a 1 1/2 year old son that has discussed the laws of gravity.. My wife would vacuum sometimes twice a day to combat the dirt, fur, and various crud every household gets but ever since we got the Eufy we maybe vacuum after crazy events or when a lot of people come over. As stated in the title this is a ""dumb"" vacuum meaning it'll just bump around without rhyme or reason until it runs low on battery or you set it to stop. There is a edging feature that is pretty decent but without the mapping that other models have it can take time so you may need to schedule edging vs standard sweeping in two separate times of the day. That being said we've found that the battery and charging doesn't last long enough for 2-3 vacuum cycles a day depending on how long you set it for (ours is maybe an 45-60 min per cycle. We bought the Eufy over the competitors purely because of the price. At the time there was a sale going on and the Eufy was almost $100 cheaper than other brands. I believe the main reason was because AI and mapping which this model Eufy Robovac 11s did not have. Pros: - Cheap - Works with pet fur and hair - picks up dirt and dust - Very easy and simple to clean and maintain (roller removes quickly) - Dust bin emptying is simple - It gets the job done (sometimes thats all you need) Cons - No mapping (may just get caught in one room depending on your setup) - Battery life and charging may not work for you","Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,"Now with only one brush, it doesn't clean as large an area as the older model","I have had a Eufy before. It broke but I decided to try one again because of the lower price. My new one, however, now only has one brush (rather than the 2 it used to have). This means that it doesn't clean as large an area. Also, there is no extra brush in the kit like there used to be. Cutting costs I guess. It cleans well but just not as much.","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,Very quiet...surprisingly strong suction,"In short: She gets 4 stars because I haven't had her long enough to give her 5. Work-from-home approved. Picks up more dust than I thought was possible for my home to have. I bought this vacuum after googling ""quietest robot vacs"" - the Eufy 11S was one that kept appearing. I was replacing an ~8 year old Neato XV-21 that wasn't recognizing the dustbin anymore, which was *loud* - it was difficult to watch TV in the other room with the door closed. when it was vaccuuming without turning the volume way up. I am pleased to report that I have used this Eufy 3 days in a row; before I talk more about the use, I should mention we are a 2 adult, 1 child (5) and 1 cat family. Not too much fur. A whole lot of crumbs. And a whole lot of tennis clay-court dirt. The first day it picked up a lot of dust. Like a lot. I had to wait to empty the dustbin just to show my husband. I also used it on the highest suction power setting. It is pretty loud on that one; however my son was able to watch TV no problem with the door closed while I followed Eufy around. Day 2. I used it on the normal ""boost IQ"" setting. Much less noise. I thought it wouldn't pick up dirt and dust, but it definitely did. Day 3. It got stuck on my bathroom mat which has some tassels and the spinning brushed did NOT like that. They got all twisted so I replaced one with the replacements that come in the box. I have noticed she tends to lift up and then get a little stuck on thin area rugs. Not a deal breaker as this type of rug is only in my home office. Some things to note: - you can definitely use Eufy while you're working from home, the noise is super tolerable. Sounds like an air conditioner window unit. - She is not the smartest. Very bump and go. BUT, my house is filled with obstacles and she navigates them; I haven't had to go on a rescue mission because she gets stuck in corners yet (just the bathroom mat). - the box comes with your first set of replacement parts (thank you!) and they are easy to find on Amazon. If you decide to go with another brand of robovac, look and see how easy it is to get replacement parts (filters, brushes, batteries, etc.). I learned the hard way with a coffee maker that had a glass carafe and when it broke it was IMPOSSIBLE to find a replacement. it's been a year and I still haven't found one. - this is a robovac, obviously there is no comparison to taking out the hoover and vacuuming the floorboards, but for daily use to make sure I am not stepping on crumbs or trailing clay dust throughout the house, it's a win.","Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2022"
B07R295MLS,4,A good buy,"This vacuum is quiet and easy to use. I like the remote where I can perform operations and change direction very easily. If you do not want a “smart vac”, this may be the one for you. It returns to the dock to recharge on its own, which my Roomba had a hard time doing. It is thin and goes under my furniture without getting stuck. I would buy this one again when it wears out.","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,"Good value, but requires patience","My 2 cats and I recently moved from a 3 bedroom house to a small 2 bedroom apartment. And even though I vacuum around their box every day when I clean it and I don’t wear shoes inside, the floor was getting visibly dirty within a day or two. So, having the Eufy vacuum every day is definitely helping to control the fur and dirt. And it’s able to vacuum both floors and area rugs with no problem. However, it can get hung up on electrical cords, thin scatter rugs (like the bath mat), and other things close to the floor (it pruned the lowest leaves off my big philodendron). So you have to “child proof” to minimize this, but unless you have no floor lamps in the house, it will get stuck once in a while. And it will move light items like dining chairs and the cat dishes when it bumps them. This is only a minor nuisance until it sloshes the water bowl and then sucks up and spreads the water, making a worse mess than it cleans. Again this can be avoided by “child proofing”, but it’s a bit annoying. Finally, although it is less work than getting out the big vacuum every other day, it needs to be emptied daily. So you can’t leave it alone for more than a day. It also needs to be cleaned weekly, but the included cleaning tool works very well, so it only takes me 5 minutes or so. I still get out the big vacuum once a week to get the spots Eufy can’t get to, but overall it is helping keep the floor looking and feeling cleaner. But now that I’ve lived with it for about a month, I wish I’d bought a slightly fancier model that learns not to run into things. And if you travel regularly, you should consider getting a unit that empties itself daily.","Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2024"

B07R295MLS,4,Gets the job done and very useful!!,"I LOVE cleaning products and trying new things, because I love when my house is clean. I have a preschooler, an infant, and a German Shepherd and after my recent deliver and recovery, it drove me nuts that I couldn't vacuum the way I wanted or as frequently as I wanted. I've never had a robot type of vacuum before, but started thinking about it. I didn't want to invest a lot into one until I tried it out, and also because my dog is scared of the vacuum and bites at it, so I didn't want him to do the same here lol. I also didn't want something with wifi as that makes me a little nervous, and I saw this on sale and grabbed it, and I'm glad I did. The suction is very good but isn't superrrrr strong (we have a German Shepherd that sheds A LOT). I'll occasionally see pieces it misses crumbs or it just will take a while to circle back and get that piece. HOWEVER, when I empty it out, it is still picking up a lot (including dog hair) and is saving me from vacuuming multiple times a day. So it's still VERY worth it in my opinion. I didn't expect the suction to be as strong as my regular vacuum but I guess I just didn't really know what to expect? I will say just remember to empty it after each use if you have a shedding dog, and also remember to get the hair out of the brush on the bottom. When you do that, it works very efficiently. I just make sure to move what I can out of the way, but if something is big enough, it just bumps into it and turns the other direction. Our coffee table is awkwardly low to the ground so it will get stuck underneath that, but it's not the vacuum's fault lol. It also doesn't do stairs, which is fine with me because I just wanted for my main floor/hard wood area. But it was well worth the money and was INCREDIBLY reasonably priced. I'm glad I got it and it's also quiet enough it doesn't scare the dog and he doesn't bite at it ;) win win!","Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2024"

B07R295MLS,4,Does The Dirty Work For You,"I've been using the Eufy 11S for 5 months now. I use the basic whole house clean, on a schedule, starting at 9 AM. It has been running every day for 3 months now. If I had to, I would probably buy one again. I purchased this robovac as we removed most the carpet from the house and refinished the hardwood floors. It was intended to pickup the surface dust so we didn't have to see it. After using it a few weeks, I was astonished how much dust, dirt, hair and stuff that it picks up EVERY DAY. ASTONISHING!! It was an eye opener how much we should have been vacuuming our carpet. On the good side, the battery lasts a long time. I have a mix of hardwood and carpet 75/25 and the vacuum usually makes a couple full sweeps of the house. It will vacuum around 2 hours before finding home charging base. It almost never gets stuck but you do have to be cognizant of cables, socks, pet toys, string, shoe strings, etc. We've mostly made the house ""fluffy"" friendly. Occasionally it spends an inordinate amount of time on the edge of the bathroom scale. Sometimes it needs rescuing but it eventually works its way off. It picks up a lot of stuff. Every Day. A lot. I can't fathom where it comes from. There is some short hair cat and dog shedding but not THAT much. The coverage is good. I like the slim profile that allows it to go under cabinets, couches and other obstacles like our bed. Speaking of which, under our bed has never been so clean!! It is pretty quiet. Much more so on carpet than hardwood of course. I have another that has a higher Pa number and it is much louder. the more powerful the motor, the louder it will be. It is nowhere near the small plane noise that comes out of my Dyson though! You need to clean the roller every couple days to ensure it is not clogged with hair, string and carpet pieces. You will also periodically remove the same threads from the front and rear rollers. Both pop out with some effort. You need to empty it every day. Just do it. You need to clean the filter every week or so. I have a compressor, so I blow it out twice a month. Some things that are less than fantastic. First, the side brushes have come off a few times due to objects it battles with like shoestrings. It is a little adventure finding them. I do not like the way the dustbin is designed. I struggle with putt it back every time. Popping it out is super simple. While getting it back in is not difficult, it just isn't super easy to slide back in. I wish! That is the only thing I would change.","Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021"

B07R295MLS,4,6 months into this experiment,"I wanted to test drive a robot vacuum and see how it would actually work and I saw this one for under $200 and thought I would give it a go. Here goes: 1. It’s short…and that is good for getting under chairs, etc that were too low for more expensive robovacs. 2. It picked up a ton of hair and dirt. Let me say this though…it seems to do MUCH BETTER on carpet than hardwood. Some of the material picked up is carpet/rug fibers. Especially at the beginning, I was very impressed with the amount of debris it got, however, 6 months in, I’m not as impressed. We have a black lab and I can literally use the remote to steer it back and forth over loose hair on hardwood and the brushes will move them around but they don’t get sucked up into it. It doesn’t matter what setting I have it on…the hairs on hardwood win. Disappointed. 3. It is not a smart robot. Now, I know that it is not advertised as working with an app…what I mean is this little sucker basically drives around and bangs his way through your house. It may detect something simple and turn around or it may find a wall/lamp and bang it’s head on it like it’s in a mosh pit. It will climb up on lamp bases and hump those things like a randy chihuahua. Do you have a stray cable that it got access to…forget about it…there is no detection or stopping. It’s sucking that thing up and dragging whatever is attached for a ride. Part of the problem with the bumping along is that it will absolutely scrape the paint off of some 1/4 round molding. If it doesn’t, it will leave plastic on it. 4. At least it was cheap. I have used expensive, programmable Roomba vacs and this. For the price, it’s a good first investment, but don’t expect miracles. You have to find what it does well and help it and determine what it sucks at and adapt your place for it. 5. It finds its way home…mostly. The biggest issue is when it wedges itself under a bookshelf or between a chair and table. 6. Would I buy again…maybe, but I’m now leaning toward investing in a Shark and seeing what it can do. With the limitations this robot has, I can’t leave our doors open and let it vacuum the whole house. It doesn’t like rugs, cables, stray strings, and many other objects that will be in the average home, so we robot-proof the place each morning before we leave so that it does a basic job of getting Mike’s hair up in a decent chunk of the house. With the Roomba, we could map the house and it didn’t have as many hang-ups. If we are having suction issues at about 6 months, I’m not sure what the expected longevity with this thing is here. We will see. We have replaced filters and brushes multiple times, so that isn’t it. It may just be the nature of the beast.","Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2022"

B07R295MLS,4,We are very happy with this solid robotic vac,"We have the RoboVac 11S programmed to clean every morning before we get up. When we first started using it, we had to empty the container during the cleaning cycle, but that was just because the unit was catching up with dust/dirt in areas that it could reach that we had not been cleaning. After a few days, when the system reached a steady state, the container would only be half full, and the floors are very clean. This is particularly noticeable in the kitchen, which has laminate floors. If one walks barefoot, you never feel any grit, and when wet mopping the floor, the pads also pick up less dirt - it just isn't there to pick up. This unit really gets the job done. The unit is easy and convenient to control using the remote. Since it uses a random motion, rather than back and forth, it takes a while to cover a room, but since it gets stuck very seldom, and one does not have to watch it, it does not matter if it takes a bit longer to finish. We liked this unit so much we decided to buy a second unit, and decided to ""move up"" to the Eufy RoboVac G30. BIG MISTAKE. The G30 has an up and down pattern, not random directions, has only one of the circular brushes, not two like the 11S. Since the circular brushes are much less than half of the width of the unit, this means that about 1/2 of the path of the machine is not brushed at all. As a result, the kitchen floor is no longer as clean as it was with the 11S (with noticeable grit in places, and the pads on the wet wipe mops having to pick up much more work); one assumes that this is the same on the rugs and hardwood floors. The phone app for using the G30 is not well designed; using the 11S remote is much more convenient. The charging stations for the G30 and 11S are the same. but using either of our two charging stations in the same locations, the G30 has problems finding its way to the charging station, unlike the 11S. While the 11S seldom gets stuck somewhere, the G30 gets stuck often, in the same rooms, with no changes in furniture placement, etc. I think that the random motion of the11S might help it get out of a problematic place, an ability lost in the G30. Finally the 11S has a pre-filter that is NOT part of the G30, so the paper filter units in the 11S stay clean/can be cleaned easier, and do not have to be replaced as often. Bottom line: 11S is very good machine, and has run well since we bought it in June. Buy the 11S, avoid the G30.","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2021"
B07R295MLS,4,Works great,"Recently moved into a ranch style house with all laminate and ceramic flooring. Wasn't sure about using a robo vac but decided to try one after seeing reviews and a good price during the last Prime day. Product was well packaged and very easy to set up. The first thing was finding a place to set the base as you need a few feet around the base and the wife preferred it out of sight when not being used. Ended up in the bedroom. After using the vac about 6 times I was impressed with how much dirt and hair was picked up. We have a small dog. The unit is very quite and goes about it's business unattended ""if"" you plan ahead. The package comes with some cord ties and I used them to get most of the extensions and power cords out of the way. Initially I just hit the start button and let the unit do it's thing but I've since change that after a few cleanings. This is an entry level unit so it's cleaning pattern is random and I wanted to ensure each room was getting sufficiently cleaned. Personally I take the unit to a bedroom I want cleaned, pick up or move things out of the way, start the unit and shut the door. After awhile I'll come back and move it to the next room,etc. I feel this is a more efficient way of cleaning meanwhile I'm doing other things while the cleaning is in progress. As for the kitchen and great room area I just block off the hallway and let it meander around. I may break these up later using a temporary barrier. I have several carpets in these areas and have had no problems as the unit goes over them. There is a divider strip between the kitchen and great room and sometimes the unit would get hung up on it. My advice is to watch what the unit is doing in your house and than make adjustments as needed so you can be free to do other things when the unit is working without having to constantly check on. BTW: the unit does come with a remote control but we haven't used it yet. The unit will automatically return to the base for recharging but because of where we put it we just turn it of and put it back otherwise it was taking forever to find the base. So far we are really pleased with the quality and performance of this unit and using it as described has made cleaning less of a chore for us.","Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2022"

B07R295MLS,4,Solid basic vac,"This is the most stripped-down no-frills robovac that has only one function and no features, but it does what it's supposed to do. I have a more advanced robot, but the lidar blimp makes it taller, so I still use the 11s max in some areas due to its slim profile. Since it has no navigation ability and just bumps around, I usually just lock it in a smaller room until the battery runs out (it's about 90 min on lowest suction and maybe 25 min on max). I don't use it unless I'm home because it gets stuck or lost all the time. The bristled brush style is terrible for long hair, I wish they had a rubber brush version, especially since it does absolutely nothing on carpets anyway - the daily hair removal is my biggest pet peeve on this machine. It does work well on hard floors and picks up a surprising amount of dust and debris from a small space that's cleaned daily. It definitely cleans better under my low bed than I do with a canister because I can't see anything underneath, and the bot spends a lot of time bumping from one support to another to really attack those dust bunnies. If you want something that avoids obstacles or cleans systematically, you need to look elsewhere. If you just want something to control dust between full cleanings, it will do the job. Don't plan on quick spot cleaning either as it the spiral pattern blows more dirt away than into the vac.","Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2024"

B07R295MLS,4,I don't have pets -- so it does the job.,"So, I guess I'm pretty pleased with the Eufy 11S. It's just me and my wife - no pets or kids, so it cleans up the normal accumulating dust and dirt as I expected it would. The auto settings are pretty good but I find I don't use them much. When set to ""auto"" I usually cancel it before it thinks it's finished because I'm satisfied with what its done, and it's kind of annoying that it goes back over the same spot several times...which I feel is redundant. If anything though, it's thorough!! Having the setting that just does edges & corners is good, although it seems to operate solely on the ""right"" edge (a very conservative unit!! :-)) I don't have a large house, so the Eufy never runs for terribly long when it's used -- therefore I don't always charge it after use. Lithium batteries last longer if they aren't charging all the time. I'll often push the ""home"" button, and then STOP it just before it reaches the base. If you run it until the battery says it's low, it'll take roughly 3 hours for a complete charge. Having the remote is handy, and being able to change the automatic cleaning path is great. The remote signal won't work around corners or through objects though. Sometimes I just want it to clean a small area at a time, so because it has no ""virtual walls"" I have to put up little barricades (or close a door) to keep it from going where I don't want it to. Sort of like putting a baby on the floor who's just learning to crawl! And of course --- you HAVE to pick up CORDS and anything else on the floor that the brushes and wheels might catch on to! Once it gets stuck -- it can't free itself. Small loose fitting rugs may also need to be moved. Rugs with rubber undersides are fine. I haven't had it long enough to gauge how long the brushes and filter will last under a normal cleaning routine. The Eufy 11S is good because; - it's relatively quiet - battery is good - it cleans thoroughly - suction is very good - dirt bin is easy to empty - works on low to medium pile rugs as well as floors","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2022"

Could not go over rugs without issue.,"I loved the idea of having a robot vacuum for me, but I found myself constantly having to follow it around like an unruly toddler, waiting for it to get into trouble. Not for me, and I got rid of it after my dog had an accident in the house and it zig-zagged the #2 across my whole home.","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,Worth it so far!,"I have had the Eufy 11s for about a month, here is how I'm liking it so far. My stats, for comparison: - 800 square foot apartment, open floor plan, no doors except to the bathroom - low-pile, high-traffic carpeting in the living and bedroom - vinyl tile in the kitchen and bathroom - no stairs or big floor thresholds - Two short-haired cats - I have the vacuum set to run every day - I empty the dust canister every time I remember, at least every three days, usually one or two days. I'll start with the cons: - drags around/bunches up my bathmat. Sometimes it beeches itself on top of the bunched up bathmat. I might be able to fix this problem by getting a different bathmat. - the brushroll gets coated with hair/fur pretty quickly, and needs to be cleaned about once per week - sometimes if it goes into a tight space (like under an armchair) , it takes a long time for it to get back out. This wastes battery life. - it definitely does not cover the whole apartment every time it runs - will try to eat anything it rolls over. Phone cords, socks, yarn, pet toys, whatever. Pros: - Reasonably quiet. We can watch TV while it is running in the same room. - It is really easy to program it run at whatever time you like (but you can't program it to only run on select days). - My floors look great. Even though it doesn't cover every square foot every time it runs, it keeps up just fine. - It does a good job of reaching edges: I live in a converted building, so the 150 year old plastered walls perpetually drop gritty, sandy, crumbly bits around the perimeter of the living room. The vacuum does a good job collecting the grit, and I don't even have to activate the ""edge mode"" setting. - The air in my apartment is visibly cleaner, and I don't have to dust my furniture as often. That is probably just the nature of running any vacuum every day, but I'm happy about it. - It forces me to keep my floors tidy, which is good habit to be in. - It comes with a little multi-tool to help maintain the brush roll and the edge-sweepers. It is a 3-in-1 brush, comb, and razor. - The base has a long power cord, which is convenient, and a little dish to keep the maintenance multi-tool. - If the vacuum gets into trouble (ate a cord, stuck on a rug, low on battery) it will either turn off to save the battery, or stop running and beep at you until you help it. It has gotten in trouble a few times, but it is usually my fault for leaving my phone cord lying on the floor. It has only run out of battery before finding its base one time. Overall: - I recommend this vacuum. - This is not a high-end, super powerful, super smart, vacuum. But I think it is a good tool for the price. - It has a few drawbacks, but they do not outweigh the benefits of having an automatic vacuum. - It won't replace your regular vacuum, but it is a great way to keep your house pretty clean between deep-cleaning. - It was really easy to set up. I think that even people who are bad with technology would do just fine. The instructions are well written, and the diagrams are useful.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2019"
B07R295MLS,4,So Far So Good,"UPDATE: Tip for confining it to one room (see pics): A thin strip or wood (a wooden yardstick would be perfect) is all you need to confine the Eufy to one room. Attached it to the base of a chair with small magnets. Position the chair in the doorway to make sure you can see the obstacle when you approach it. Even if you trip over it (which I have still done -- even with the chair to remind me), the strip of wood breaks free easily, and is unlikely to cause a major spill. When you are done, store the magnetic strip on the side of your refrigerator. End Of Update. We keep a very clean house, with a LOT of vacuuming, and no pets. But, we live in a dry, dusty area, and I track in and out out of the garage a lot. It was a little surprising what it picked up on the first couple of run-throughs. It ran for one hour and 45 minutes on ""standard"" on the first attempt. On the second attempt, it ran for over an hour set on ""Max"". There were two areas where it had trouble. See pictures. The first was a fan base that was very short and angled up on the edges. It easily climbed up on top of the base and got stuck between the wall and the base. ""Stuck"" is not the best word; as it kept moving back and forth trying to get off, and it finally would free itself. Then it would climb back on. It had a hard time with it, beating up the brushes and wasting battery power. Painful to watch!! The second trouble area was a series of guitar stands. It was helpless when it got tangled up there. This is certainly not common, so no way would I dock any stars for this. Both problems were easily fixed; the fan by hot-glueing small wooden blocks under to raise it up a little; the guitar stands by fixing a 1X2"" in front of them. Picture #3 shows results-- the blob on the right was Run #1, the blob on the left was Run #2. The ""Return To Home"" feature usually works OK; when it does it is pretty cool! Move all electric cords out of the way, and don't leave any shoes (with shoelaces) on the floor. It has some trouble with the edges of rugs...nothing that it has not overcome so far. If you have a lot of scatter rugs it might get frustrating. If you only have bare floors this thing seems ideal. If you try to watch TV while it's running, it won't go off to some far-flung corner of the house to work. It likes to run right under your chair. Seems almost devious. No idea about the reliability; if it holds up, I like it.","Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2021"
B07R295MLS,4,Better than I thought - The need to know,"I recently bought this vacuum and had my doubts. After all I already owned a robot vacuum and returned it for it not working very well (another brand). I read all of the positive reviews on the Eufy and decided to give it a shot. The other vacuums that mop and vacuum don't rate very well so I would recommend still buying a separate mop to clean the hardwood floors. I mostly have tile in the house. We unboxed the Eufy and the kids promptly named him ""Moby"", a new member of the family. Assembly was very straight forward, snap the spin brushes in, plug in the charging station and let him charge. Battery Life: There are 3 suction settings that affect battery life. Standard power, Boost IQ which detects if it's on a rug or carpet and needs extra suction power and Max suction. I can usually get a little over an hour of vacuuming in. Sound: Very quiet for a vacuum Navigation: These models don't map anything out, however they aren't like the original Roombas that just slam into everything. The bump guard on the front ensures nothing is damaged including when it cleans around fragile vases or our piano. There are some flaws, sometime's it doesn't want to go straight and will slightly keep veering to the right. Wheels aren't stuck, I believe it just does this to hug corners and make sure it cleans everywhere. Sometimes it will get the same area more than once, and sometimes it won't get any areas at all. The selling point with this is that you run it MULTIPLE times and eventually it will cover the whole house. Let me tell you, this vacuum is EFFECTIVE. At first we were running it 4 times a day to keep up with the clutter. The floors feel so much cleaner now, and we used to hand vacuum a lot before. Cleans up long dog hair, dust, dirt, you name it. Even when the floors look and feel clean I run it and the dust bin will be completely full. CONS/THE BAD: This thing picks up EVERYTHING. If any cords or cables are out, it will get stuck on them or pull on them. It will frequently find stuff that will jam the rotors requiring a quick fix. The rotors have a unique design to remove them so nothing gets clogged. To some this could be good because it is encouraging you to pick up stuff off the floor HOWEVER it does require some babysitting if there is a lot of things on the floor. Now that everything is picked up it can run without interruption Food for thought: One thing people don't consider is that if you let this puppy run in the rooms, it will navigate all around and under your bed, dressers, everywhere. It gets all of that dust and dirt down there that nobody reaches with a regular vacuum. This alone can help with allergen issues. The only con is that if you have a lot of crap under your bed, it's going to get stuck. Other things such as the remote are easy to use and steer with if needed. There is a chart on the Eufy and remote for what the different beeps mean to communicate to you. All in all, this product was great and absolutely worth the money. I don't like that it comes with parts that wear down over time and need replacing like the spin brushes, but this company was great and sent 2 extra brushes included (they ensure the baseboards and tight corners are clean).","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2019"
B07R295MLS,4,Cleans well..,"I was looking to get another Eufy vac. I have solid flooring throughout my 1st floor. I wanted one a little different than the first. The cleaning pattern is random which I knew. It doesn’t seem to get as hung up in a spot when it can’t go straight. But… this does not have a phone app and have to use a remote to turn it on. Not a big deal, just a convenience I enjoyed with my first one. Additionally, this new one does not seem to recognize home when it is near it in cleaning cylcle. My first one has a perimeter that it uses around charging station and never comes close to it. This new one will run up, run into and move it a bit when it is near. Negatives-no phone app and hits/moves charging base. Positive… both of my Eufy’s do an excellent job cleaning. It surprises my how the floor “really doesn’t look that bad”, but the container s always full when emptied.","Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,See Update of previous review.,"Another update more than a year later. After some really excellent customer service and a replacement I can now say that I am very happy with Eufy. It has very good suction and keeps my hardwood floors free of dog hair. It picks up a lot every night when it runs and I genuinely live having it. When it dies I will buy another. I would like one that empties itself but they are still too ridiculously expensive. Anyway, I just had to update my review. I’m bumping it up to 4 stars. I would give it 5 if I had no issues in the beginning. I changed my review from 1 star to 3 stars because of the outstanding customer support. Ultimately my issues was solved. It remains at 3 because I’m still comparing it to the iLife I bought fir 1/2 the price. See Update below - - - This robot vac was a terrible disappointment. I purchased it in November and gave it as a gift on Christmas to replace my wife’s dead iLife A4s which she loved. The iLife only lasted about 18 months but it was well under $200 when I purchased it from Amazon in 2018. Consumer Reports gave the eufy 11s a high rating. It was like in 2nd place under a much more expensive iRobot. The eufy immediately kept getting stuck on things that the iLife handled without issue. By 120 days it was just dying in the middle of the room without every going home to charge. We exercised the 1 year waranty and was told that we would have to take a refurbished item since it was passed 90 days. Fine, send me a refurb. I’ve had that one for a week or two and it’s doing the same thing. I would not purchase it again it recommend it to a friend. Want a cheap robot vac buy an iLife. You’ll at least get more than a year out of it. Update————- eufy customer support continued to reach out to me via email unsolicited to make sure my issues had been resolved. The hey did not stop until I was satisfied. They offered to exchange the 11s for another of their models in the same price range. Ultimately they offered to send a second charging base free of charge in case the other was too far away and in my relatively large home that was why eufy would often not make it home to charge. That seems to have solved the problem. My iLife was 1/2 the price and did not have these problems initially. However, it only lasted about 18 months and significantly lost suction after 12. If eufy outlasts the iLife I will call it the winner.","Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2021"
B07R295MLS,4,"Good Daily Sweeper, But Kinda Dumb...","We named ours E-Bot, and he trundles around the house sucking up dust, hair, and crumbs, and all too often cables, papers, and clothing. Cleaning Power: 3/5 The robot works like a broom most of the time, and given a perfectly flat floor in a rectangular room, he will suck up just about anything, but in the real world, it struggles to actually pick up dust and hair. Running once a day keeps the floors acceptably clean, though. We empty his cartridge once every other day for a 900sf cleaning area. Mapping, Object Avoidance, Navigation: 3/5 This is where our E-Bot struggles. We rescue him at least twice during his sweep cycles when he runs up onto something that didn't have enough reflectivity to redirect his IR sensors, but also wasn't quite high enough to press on his front bumper to get him to turn. Any kind of string, cable, bag straps, or lightweight clothing gets immediately wrapped around the side or main brushes and brings him to a beeping halt. When he's in a perfectly clean environment, he does okay at not getting stuck, but often re-cleans the same areas and ignores others. He is very all-terrain, and frequently astounds us with how stuck he can get. Features: 4/5 This is where Eufy packed a lot of value into the vacuum. The auto-schedule run time is awesome, and being able to send him home to the charge station at the push of a remote button is super handy! E-bot has several clean styles, and a few different suction/noise settings that run off of some sort of detector when set to ""BoostIQ mode,"" which lets the vacuum impeller ""suck"" harder in short bursts to clean up heavy messes. E-Bot lacks a ""canister full"" alert, and will keep trying to clean even when jammed full of hair and dirt, so you have to manually check and empty the canister every other day or so. The ""edge"" sensors don't seem to work well either, and I wouldn't recommend using it at the top of stairs or significant drops. Overall, not nearly as good as a name brand Roomba, but definitely a decent cleaning bot for 1/3rd the price! Our E-bot keeps our floors clean, and despite the drawbacks, he's been a great little robot!","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2022"

B07R295MLS,4,Seems to be Doing a Good Job After 1 Day/2 and a 1/2 runs,"Here's my initial review. I received the product last night and I couldn't WAIT to start using this! I followed the instructions on the ""quick start"" and set the unit up to charge. I added the little broom-like whiskers when I read the instructions more carefully. After the first round of our one story home (2 big rooms with no carpet, 3 rooms with carpet, 2 bathrooms, and 1 kitchen) it returned to its home to charge. So cute! Even though it was late at night and we were already retired to bed ... I sprang out to check the results. The eufy's dirt basket (Technical term) was full of dust and yuck ... and the roller thing-y (also technical term) was LACED tightly with hair: mine and our huge dog, Bird, who is mostly great Pyranese (So. Much. Hair. In. Our. House). The hair was laced so tightly I had to cut it off with scissors. Gross, but necessary. When I got up this AM I wanted to start it cleaning again, as there was still visible dog hair tufts, debris from outside (Bird loves walks and brings home detritus like twigs and leaves in his fur), etc. on the floor. The blue light was flashing ""charged"" but the eufy would leave its charging station and then stop, flashing yellow/orange for ""Charge."" I googled the problem, and I tried turning it off and on again. That worked. The eufy cleaned for a few hours and then returned to charge. When it was flashing blue again, I thought to check the roller thing and the dirt basket. Just as much as last time. I again had to resort to scissors to get it off. I also had to do the ""turn off/turn on"" thing again so it would work. I'm now running it for its third time through the house. One thing. The reviews I read said that the noise was minimal, as did the advertising. I do NOT find it to be quiet or low noise. You can definitely hear our little robot vacuum whirring around our house sucking up dirt and dog hair. My hope is that if we run this thing every day at least once that it will do most of the heavy day-to-day maintenance of keeping our floors relatively clean. With a full-time and super stressful job, as well as a passion for cooking, I absolutely do not have capacity to sweep and vacuum every day. It would great if, when we mop the hardwood or do a ""real"" human facilitated vacuum once a week or so, it's much less labor intensive due to our little robot friend. Also, I already love him. He's so cute! It's fun to watch him bounce around tight spaces and maneuver his way out of tight spaces. He's very clever. Bird-dog is also scared of him, and scoots out of the way as he approaches, which is adorable. I'm giving four stars now because there is still visible dirt/hair on the floors and the fact that I have to turn it off/on to get it to work after a charge.","Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2020"
B07R295MLS,4,Quiet! works well so far.,"**Update 1/24/20 ** days after my initial review we began suffering issues. We discovered the vac wasn't running according to the schedule. I pushed the top button on the vacuum, it beeped once, the blue light flashed to orange, it flashed for a few seconds then revered back to blue. Tried again and it repeats. Removed it from the base and pushed the button and nothing. Turned it off and on again and the vac runs via manual start. I've submitted a support request with Eufy and will further update once I hear back from them. Replacing a iRobot Roomba which we have had for many years (5+). I've really liked the product, but the cost of a new replacement just kept me in a perpetual debate cycle. I got a notification of the 11S going on sale for a really reasonable price, so I just decided to make the purchase. First impressions after a week of use, its crazy quiet, especially in comparison to my old Roomba. I can actually let it run while watching TV or listening to music, which was in no way possible with the Roomba. That alone is a HUGE plus. The remote is fine, I would have preferred a smart vac with app support, but again, the cost was an issue and I couldn't justify the added cost for the minimal applicable features as I saw it. Cleaning it does a really good job. I primarily have Hardwood, but some carpet and rugs and it does a bang-up job, transitioning from one surface to another without any problems. Cleans each very well. After two cycles, I had to empty the tray as it was filling up. Additional observations so far: - it is a short profile, so gets underneath some furniture that my Roomba didn't, which is six of one, half a dozen of the other. Causes issues in some cases, such as cables under the entertainment center, but is great that it can get under a lounger. - When the battery gets low, the vac gets really slow. It either runs the battery to the near brink and is struggling or its programed to save as much power as possible as it seeks out its base. Which, speaking of its base, it has only found it once in 4 tries so far. This isn't a problem for me, I just tell it to try harder next time and then move my focus to something that really matters in this world. - Absolutely no issues with my stairs so far. - I do miss the LED (not really sure its led) boundary devices that came with the Rooba. Those were a reasonable solution given my needs over the strips that Eufy provided. I just couldn't get my head around the strips, like where to place them or anything so it kinda kept me from moving to a higher-end model that supported the strips. Now I use pillows, furniture or doors to impede my Eufy. -Last thing, Eufy. . . consider me a regular customer. I have several smart lights, plugs and now a vac and I have been very pleased with each and every product, so well done you!","Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2020"

B07R295MLS,4,It picks up a lot of dirt,"This little robot picks up a ton of dirt. A ton. You will have to empty the canister every time it runs. I love that about it, my floors are now constantly clean with no real effort on my part. But this machine is DUMB. It's designed to just scoot around, bumping in to things and then making a random turn and carrying on its way. Unfortunately this level of stumbling around until the goal is reached also extends to when its time to dock. If you hit the home button or the session ends half the time it will turn and head back to the docking station, half the time it turns the opposite way. It's like it can't really communicate with the base. And it takes a dozen times of backing up, reorienting, moving forward, missing the base, backing up, reorienting and on and on to actually get it back on the base. If you can ignore the several minutes of incessant beeping while it figures that process out then you are going to love this vacuum. I hate that it can't get back to its base the first time, or the second time, or the third time, so I deducted a star.","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2024"

Potential buyers should be aware that the device does not map, nor does it provide any record of cleaning activity (other than the waste bin amount). I did not see this mentioned when I looked at the reviews. I purchased it because it can fit under all the furniture due it's low profile. However, now knowing the way it 'navigates', I probably would have selected a different unit. The 11S Max using a 'ping pong' diagonal sweep method, and also a perimeter sweep method. I have found that I will need to close it in the room I want to clean and just let it run for close to an hour, then recharge and move to a different room. Not preferred, but it does clean just fine.

Instead of having 2 sweeping arms to pull dirt into the middle to be sucked up, it now only has 1. I was very disappointed to see this change. Also, my unit came with no sweeping arms, so I used one I already bought for my older one. I do like that this is controlled by a remote that sits on the docking station. I set it and it runs as scheduled daily. I like this better than my internet controlled vacuum as it has less issues since I don't have to worry about it connecting/disconnecting from the internet. Hopefully it works sufficiently with only the 1 sweeper arm. Im not sure I'd have bought this model had I realized this.

B07R295MLS,4,"I love it, but the cat is very suspicious","I wanted to try out a vacuum robot but wasn’t looking to spend $500. I got this based on the great reviews and low price and I have not been disappointed. I have it set to go off every morning at 9 AM, and it cleans for at least an hour and a half before it returns to the charging stand due to low battery. I love the fact that at any point I can just pick it up and carry it to one of our upstairs rooms and let it clean there, and I can be doing things while it’s vacuuming. It will sense when it’s reached an edge and will not go off the stairs. I was amazed that for the first five days it would come back full of dirt even though we vacuumed fairly regularly. Now that it’s running every morning it comes back about half full (we have a dog an a cat), still incredible that it finds that much dirt and hair! It does a pretty good job getting over the transitions in our floor, only occasionally needing a little nudge. It seems to have a sensor directly in front of it and will avoid obstacles straight ahead, the obstacles to the side it will gently bump into and then continue to turn a couple degrees and try again until it gets itself back out. Although I love it, our cat is very suspicious and follows it around everywhere. :-) 2024 Edit: I was so impressed with this product I bought a second one for our second home. Unfortunately this one has been less than stellar. Although it does a good job cleaning like my original one, this one has fallen down the stairs three times, the most recent fall putting a huge dent in my wall.

B07R295MLS,4,Works great but may not that durable.,"I have owned the Eufy 11s for 19 months and have been pleased with its overall performance - especially given its price. This is my first robotic vacuum and it has performed on par with expectations. Its daily cleaning has helped keep my home cleaner - and saved me time. Yeah, it bops along in a random pattern but it gets the job done to my satisfaction. In particular, have been impressed with how well the battery has held up - I have it scheduled to clean once a day and the battery still lasts 100 minutes - just as it did on day one. My only concern is that it is not as durable as I had hoped. It performed flawlessly for the first year, but as soon as I hit that 1 year mark (the end of the warranty) parts began to fail. Replacing worn parts on an inexpensive device doesn't bother me too much - but you need to remove lots of screws and awkwardly dismantle the entire unit to access one failed part. Thank God for several good youtube videos. In my case the brush roll motor failed first - again, immediately after the warranty period ended. It probably cost $25 and an hour of my time to replace. Now it needs one of the side brush motors replaced. I am at the point of making a decision - buy another Eufy 11s and keep my old one for parts or upgrade to another more ""durable"" / more easily accessed brand. Finally, would I recommend this unit? For someone like me - probably so. At only $129 it was a great introduction to robotic vacuums and I can still repair it and keep it going for a few years. That said, I hate the idea of someone else buying one of these and throwing it in a landfill after a year because they don't want to repair it.","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2022"
B07R295MLS,4,"Great cleaning for a robot vacuum, still has weird robot vacuum quirks","I purchased this to replace a 3 year old Roomba 650 that doesn't have enough suction to pick up hair anymore. It will be relegated to basement duty. Might see how it does in the garage. Anyway, this cleans much better than my old Roomba, especially on my rugs. It gets nearly all of the dog hair, and there is a lot. It has 2 feet instead of Roomba's 1, which I'd imagine helps ""scoop"" the float-y hair into the suction area a little better. It is not a replacement for a traditional vacuum when it comes to dust; I experimented by running a big heavy Hoover over the room this little guy had just cleaned, and still got a significant amount in the canister. I'd imagine any robotic vacuum at this price point would not be a substitute. That being said, if you have allergies or just a dusty house, it's something to keep in mind. It's very slim and sleek looking, especially compared to the old Roomba. It gets underneath most of my furniture, and usually is able to get back out. It is also very quiet; it's quieter than many fans might be. It also does a fairly good job of slowing before running into objects, so there's isn't too much banging around. It doesn't get hung up on curtains I have dragging on the ground, which is really nice, because I am certainly not classy enough to rearrange my curtains every day. My only complaint is its ability to go over variations in floor height is unpredictable. Sometimes it makes it over the threshold into my kitchen, sometimes it does not. Even though it sometimes can't get in there, it does always escape, so I have to barricade it in there to do the kitchen. My fireplace hearth is about 1"" higher than the surrounding floor, with a metal lip around it. Eufy always thinks it can climb up there, even though it rarely can, so it often spends several minutes grinding up against the lip before giving up and turning around or shutting down. This is pretty annoying as this model isn't compatible with boundary strips, and using 3-4 pieces of random furniture around my fireplace and then vacuuming where the furniture was manually isn't exactly fun. My Roomba did not do this; it was a little more aware of its limits. In retrospect, I should've shelled out the extra $20 for the model with boundary strip compatibility to solve the hearth issue. But I'm still pleased with my purchase; on a black Friday sale the price was right and I feel I've gotten a good value.","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2020"
B07R295MLS,4,Surprised at what she comes up with,"This is my second robotic vacuum. We specifically chose the 11 S model because of its low profile and the fact that it is not as noisy as some of the other vacuums out there. We named ours “Alice “after they maid from the Jetsons. Alice does a great job most of the time. However, she does get stuck on pretty much anything you leave laying around so you really need to pay attention to what’s on the floor or she will get stuck on shoelaces, extension cords, charging cables, anything that she can get up onto and get the wheels off contact with the floor. However on the positive side I will say that the amount of stuff that this thing picks up is exceptional. I empty it nearly every day and I’m amazed at how much stuff is in the waste bin. The little spinning whiskers on the front can easily be removed and cleaned and straightened out again by running them under hot water and then let them air dry. I have a compressor in my garage for my tools and I easily blow out the air filter from time to time which makes it as good as brand new. The remote control is helpful if you want to “drive it “otherwise it’s useful for setting the schedule and that’s about it. I have mine on a daily schedule, she comes on at 10 AM does her thing and always seems to find her way back to the charging station. That is a huge plus. Things that I don’t like about her is not necessarily under her control. Human hair seems to be the biggest obstacle for hours. I have two women that live at home that “shed “ all the time and if I ever find Alice just sitting in the middle of the floor not doing anything when I come home, it’s typically because enough human hair has wrapped around the rotating bristles and I guess they have a safety feature built-in where if there’s too much resistance on that bristle it automatically shuts off. So I know to flip her over , take the round brush head off which is simple, clean off the hair which they give you a tool for, reinstall it and she’s good to go I guess I can’t really complain for her doing her job. Overall I recommended this model to several family and friends and would still recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2022"
B07R295MLS,4,Pleasantly surprised,"With how many robot vacuums there are on the market, it can be daunting to choose one. I got sucked into the vacuum review spiral and was reading about all different models, their specs, their reviews, etc. After days of contemplation, I ended up deciding on this one. Here is my experience this far: -This is a random pattern device. It drives in a straight line until it senses or bumps an object, then readjusts (except in edge mode, where it follows the wall). Despite the random pattern, it cleans incredibly well and nearly covers my entire floor plan daily. -No fancy app with floor mapping, it just uses a controller to manually drive, start/stop, change functions, or set calendar start times. I actually chose this due to the lack of floor mapping, because now I can place it on different levels of the house throughout the week without confusing the little guy. -Great suction power! I haven’t seen it drive over something and leave it behind yet. It will get caught on small things like the edges of carpets, wires, etc. but if you make sure they’re up off the ground or not easily accessible, this device will maneuver easily around it. -The object sensing is pretty decent. It has some type of sensor that is able to see lighter colors (mainly white) and will redirect without touching them. Darker objects it will bump into and the front bumper will cause it to redirect. If you have white molding, this will definitely save your walls from scuffs! -The trap is easy to clean out, and I was highly surprised by how much it picks up daily! We have a 1,600sq Ft house and even when we ran it after we cleaned ourselves, it still managed to pick up a full bin of dirt. It does a decent job with long hair, but some will still get looped around the brush. Simply remove the brush and cut the hair out to clean. -While this isn’t the most sophisticated device on the market, if you’re looking for a great entry level model that works well while not breaking the bank, this is your sign to buy this one!","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2022"
B07R295MLS,4,Great Beginner RoboVac,"If you have never had a Robot Vac this is a good starter to learn what you might need or want in a Robot. Since they range in price for $150 to $1500 another brand top of the line , what will work best for your home? This one picks up great and always is an embarassment dumping the container. Where does this stuff come frrom? I empty it each time to clean the roller and filters. Clean filters extend motor life. If you have pets you will want to clear the roller too using the enclosed tool . So this comes to the first point do you need self emptying? I think no, since it will not clean the roller or filter or wipe out the dust bin. You are likely to not maintain your Robot using this device. Does the self empty dock have a Filter bag or do you just dump the container and hold your breath, these Robos pick up a lot of fine dirt. Next are navigation systems there are basically 3, the first of which this vac has is none. It runs around randomly and eventually covers everything or runs out of power and tries to find its way home. If it did not you need to carry it back to the charger where it needs to live for 6 hours to get to 100%. In my case th random ping pong action drives me crazy it may go over the same spot 3 x but miss others. Other navigation systems are availble but the price increases accordingly. You want to step up to a next level system using ""gyro's (not yeero's) and optics. This nav level more or less goes back and forth in straight lines. They also may have a phone app and magnetic boundary strips to block an area . I might move up to this next to compare price / performance. Current bleeding edge tech units use combos or individual tech incling ""Lidar or laser/radar or some include cameras which may not work in dark? These units are capable of mapping your floor plan some can hold multiple plans for multistory houses and llow you to create virtual boundaries on those maps to b;ock off certain areas. No matter what unit you buy you will need to Robot proof your house of things to get tangled in such as lamp cords, fringe and anything else it might like to gobble up. Eufy 11S is a great starter vac or may be all you need.","Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2020"
B07R295MLS,4,Works very well,"Works better than I thought. You may still need a regular vacuum for bigger, heavier and embedded stuff. Even the manual says to use a “vacuum cleaner” to clean the filter. But for keeping your floors clean for a longer period of time after a regular vacuum this works great. You plugin the charger and put it against a wall and set the vacuum on it and wait till it gets a full charge. Then press the auto button on the remote and off it goes. This one uses a random pattern to clean a room / house. It may not get all area's the first time it runs or even the second time but eventually it should get all area's. You can point it to area with the remote and it will clean where you tell it to. When it is done it returns to the charger. The first few times you run it you might use the fan (vacuum) on max, it will make a little more noise but will pick up more. It does very well going from tile to carpet and carpet to area rug. It did have a problem with a corner of the area rug but got itself out of it. If you have animals (or people with long hair) you will need to clean hair out of the rollers when you empty the tray. They do supply a roller cleaning brush. The first couple times we ran it I found that the dust tray would be full before the units battery needed charging (about every 20 min). The third day it ran for almost an entire hour and the tray was just over half full. It takes about 4 hours to get a full charge. It will run on a partial charge so if you have a spot that needs attention you can call it out. The manual said to move things off the floor that it might have a problem with. I missed a few cables. It did not hurt any cables but it did get stuck on some, it was able to get itself free but took a minute or so. I would think a plastic trash bag would be a problem for it. I liked how soft the carpet felt after it ran. It did miss some picking up some things like small rocks but I just picked them up. It can be programed to clean on a schedule everyday. (your results could be different) I give it a ""recommend purchase"". Some minor quirks but overall it worked well and does save us time. The manual is a bit hard to read but found on page 25 under error codes it is stated to let it charge for 5 hours and on page 26 it states the charging time is 300 to 360 min (5 to 6 hours) Like I stated above it seemed 4 hours was about what it took for me. (I am waiting for the lawn mowing attachment and maybe a window cleaning attachment would be nice... ) Tap Tap..","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2019"
B07R295MLS,4,5 Things To Know Before Buying ANY Robovac Including the Eufy 11S,"Having wanted to try a robovac for a while we were pleased to scoop up this highly-rated model on sale. After seven cleaning runs on our 2,400 sq feet main level we have learned several things about robovacs in general. 1) YOU have to clean before the robovac can clean. That means picking up toys, clothes, and other items that will jam or obstruct the robovac. 2) Robovacs do not get along with cords, cables and wires. This includes headphones left on the floor and mouse and keyboard cables dangling from the back of a computer. Trust me. 3) Robovacs can't move furniture so it may not clean under your kitchen or dining room table if the chairs are left down or under your night stand, buffet, coffee table and definitely not under couches and love seats. 4) Most robovacs do not like anything wet. Puddles on the bathroom floor after a shower, spilled milk in the kitchen, and bubble soap on the foyer hardwoods tend to clog the filter and make the motor work harder. See point 1 above. 5) Robovacs cannot remove stains, dried on food or bubble gum. You will still need to work on these by hand. In general robovacs are great at maintenance cleaning - keeping crumbs, dust and pet hair off the floor - which is a wonderful service on it's own. Our Eufy 11S runs a full hour on max suction before returning to base to recharge. It takes 2 to 3 hours to recharge. The tray is always full of dog hair, dust and crumbs so we know it is working and we can feel the clean under our feet on the pine floor in the kitchen and tile floor in the bathroom. It also does a good job on the medium pile carpet in our living room and the berber in our bedroom. For the seven cleaning runs we have done in two days Eufy has only found its way back to the base once but that's because it got tangled in laundry or cables twice and received ""compassionate assistance"" from the family four other times. We have started to refer to it as another person. Our older dog who hates our stick vac just sits and watches the Eufy with no emotion. The Eufy is quiet and efficient, albeit erratic with the cleaning pattern. Our experience has been that it takes two or three passes across our carpet from different directions before it gets all the dog hair up but it does eventually get it all clean. For the $150 we paid for the Eufy we are very happy. The only feature it doesn't seem to have is the ability to start cleaning again automatically once fully charged. You can program a specific time for each day but what we are looking for is constant 24x7 auto-cleaning. No big deal. We just hit the auto button on the included remote and off he goes.","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2019"
B07R295MLS,4,"Good cost, effective cleaning, good first time robovac.","I’m a first time Robovac user, and it took me weeks to find which one I wanted to buy. My boyfriend really wanted the Roomba (a leader in robovac but EXPENSIVE) and I was between Eufy and Shark Ion based on reviews. I did LOTS of research on all three, looking at suction power, carpet ability, hair pick up, and of course COST. All have pros and cons on their user reviews and tech reviews. Anyway, I ended up buying the Eufy 11 model based on COST and reviews for the suction power. I’ve had it only TWO days now, and have used it twice, so this is my “FIRST LOOK” review. First, I had an amazon gift card from my birthday and I have the amazon prime credit card, so for me this was the best platform to buy to save even more money and get points. Pro: similar look as other robovacs, came quickly, EASY to set up out of box, price is significantly cheaper than other vacs, pretty good at cleaning dust under couches and bed, feathers from comforter, and my dark gray low pile carpet. Simple use and has a manual that helps troubleshoot any error alarms. Quiet!!! Even it’s max suction option isn’t as loud as other vacuums. Good for just daily maintenance cleaning, probably won’t be good for deep cleans or big messes. Cons: The vacuum cleans in a RANDOM pattern and bumps off of things as it goes to feel it’s way around, this drives my OCD a bit crazy because I wish it would clean one area first and then move on, I actually ended up manually controlling it while on my carpet so it would pick up the lint I saw and wanted gone before letting it continue to move on randomly around the room. The remote is a simple design, but the vacuum isn’t up to date with others that have WIFI controlling and an app, so it’s one more remote lying around my apartment. I have VERY LONG HAIR, so after one use I flipped it over and my hair was all tangled in the rolling brush and some in the side brushes. I had to remove it to cut my hair out of it and clean the roller so it would work efficiently next time. This for me will get annoying, so I may have to pre vacuum my hair up first or do a deep clean with my hand held vacuum once a week still. Takes a while to fully charge. Overall, this does what I wanted for my 1100 sq ft apartment, and helps me not have to vacuum daily using my handheld. I can cook or watch TV while it runs and know my apartment will be nice and neat. The price made sense for me and it cleans my carpet well so far. If you’re a first time user, so far I’d recommend this. I will post another review after a month or two. Enjoy!","Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2019"
B07R295MLS,4,Does the job,Works well not as well as a regular vacuum but I run this daily and then vacuum a couple of times a week. It helps to keep up with the dog hair,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,"Not the smartest, but does the job","My husband and I have been looking at a lot of robot vacuums because we have two cats and hard wood floors. I didn't want to pay a lot for one and I found this one on a black Friday deal and decided to go for it based on all the reviews. I will first start off by saying, this vacuum does not have the ability to map out your room and just goes around aimlessly and sometimes repeatedly in the same place. However, it's amazing how much this little thing picks up! Every day we run it in the morning and every day we are surprised by how much it picks up. Because of it's slim design, it fits under our dressers and other places we never get to. It's very quiet and has no problem with the transitions from hardwood, to rug, to tile. It even goes on my kitchen and bath mats without a problem (it doesn't really care for the contour rugs though). We do have to make sure we pick up cat toys because there have been a few times that they have gotten tangled up in the brushes but once we clear it, off it goes. As far as finding it's docking station, it depends how close it is. We have an L-shaped couch in our living room and the charger is in the hallway kind of behind the couch. If it decides it needs to dock while it's on the other side of the couch, it has a hard time figuring out how to get back to the dock and will power down eventually until we put it in ""view"" of it. If it's in the kitchen or hallway or away from the couch, it has no problem docking. Overall, we are very happy with our purchase as it has saved us a lot of time of vacuuming up hair tumble weeds with a stick vacuum. ***UPDATE as of 11/2/2020 So our robot started to have some issues - one of the brushes would stop working if it hit carpet and making this horrible grinding noise. Also, our battery's life was cut down and it wasn't vacuuming as long as it use to. I realized that we had a warranty so I contacted the company. They were VERY responsive and explained ways to fix it with included videos (luckily my husband is an engineer because it looked complicated to me!). Since our robot was still under warranty, they offered us a refurbished robot which we gladly accepted. They also checked back in with us to make sure that our new robot was working and if we were happy with the replacement. So if you have any issues, please reach out to them because they are great to work with!","Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2020"
B07R295MLS,4,A Lot Of Power For The Money,"I have now owned this unit for 2 months, wanted to wait to review. First my review will be to the point, and I have a 5 year old mid priced Roomba that is still working, was impressed by the reviews, the price for this unit, thought I would try it. First off it’s so much quieter then my Roomba, has longer battery life and doesn’t vacuum like a drunk person. I do have 3 non shedding dogs, we have a single story 2,100 sq ft home. No carpet, all wood or tile. We do have several rugs, I put a short video showing how well it transitions from wood to rugs. When I first got it I was very concerned about the parts being very cheap, has more plastic then my Roomba, I did buy the extra filters, roller parts. Seems after running at least 5 days a week for two months the parts are holding up well, did change to a new filter this week. Some of the reviews I read people didn’t clean it after every use, I personally don’t see how they don’t need to clean and empty after every use, we do and that is a downside that with the Roma I didn’t have to do but it didn’t pick up as much! I would recommend this unit, I was willing to pay more but the people’s reviews convinced me to try this one, no regrets! I love that the unit has a orange light that stays on till it’s fully charged, blue light means ready. I don’t like that it doesn’t charge and continue to clean like my Roomba did. It is better at docking then my Roomba was. I use the max setting every time, as you can see in the picture that it’s a lie that my breed of dog doesn’t shed, I think it cleans better then the Roomba, also handles all my rugs better then the Roomba. I just pick up my bath rugs before running it. 90% of the time it makes it way back to charge on it’s own, that’s a gift! We have beds high enough for the it to go under, hate when it dies under a king bed! I would recommend this unit, I hope it’s still going after 5 years like my Roomba, I hope my review helps you make the decision to go for it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2023"
B07R295MLS,3,The Best Cat Toy That Cleans Even Complex Home Layouts,"I always thought these robot vacs were kind of a silly gimmick, too expensive for not enough gain. After a couple friends raved about their robovac's, I made excuses like ""My home layout is too complex!"" and ""I'll need three of them to vacuum my home!"" But, the robot wars have made them cheaper and better, so I decided to finally give in on a good deal with this new model from a well trusted brand. I wasn't willing to pay for units with home mapping features and no-go zones, but with this unit, I don't feel I even need it. Turns out, I am absolutely thrilled with the performance and price point of these Eufy's. There is little doubt this unit is just slightly smarter than a bag of hammers. Thank goodness I can make it do it's work at 4AM when I don't care how many times it goes over the same spot or misses something that is just ""right over there you stupid bleeping robot!"" But, day after day, this hunk of electronic sensors strapped to a vacuum comes home with a bin full of stuff. I'm at the point where I don't even know where it gets the stuff and I'm seriously questioning my ability to clean my house. And also somewhat ashamed of the filth that I've lived with and didn't even know about. It goes places it probably shouldn't and if you have any degree of OCD, it will hurt your brain to watch it. It goes under furniture and shelving where it barely manages to escape, plays ping pong with table/chair legs for a bit and it has an inexplicable infatuation with the clear storage totes under my guest bed. It'll really like one area/room for awhile, but then will go elsewhere, only to be back 2 minutes later...and you're like, ""Well, that was the *least* efficient way to do that. Whatever, a goldfish is smarter than you."" Whenever I'm in the kitchen doing something, it has the whole lower floor it could be cleaning, but it will insist several times on cleaning the spot right under my feet. It loves to chase my cats and in turn, my cats will engage it in a battle of home domination, swatting it and trying to eat the spinny brushes while it charges. One cat will lay on the lower step and lazily swat at it as it goes by. Just when you think there might be the slightest sense of intelligence and you're having this ""It's alive!"" moment, it reminds you how dumb it is by gently ramming itself into a piece of furniture. I don't know how it does it, but despite looking like it couldn't find it's way out of a paper bag, it somehow manages to find home base for charging most of the time. But, it gets around, even in an ever changing layout. It deals with my wood floors, several area rugs and a section of medium pile carpet without much incident. It hasn't once tried to go over a stair in my home. It gets probably a good 70%+ of a complex, 1,000 square foot U-shaped layout of my main floor, with plenty of furniture making navigation much worse. But, it does that 70%+ every day and I don't even have to think about it. Based on the sheer amount of cat hair and dust this thing picks up daily, I'd say the suction and pickup mechanisms are pretty good. I can't tell you if they're better than older Eufy or other branded units, but the spec's say so. I was worried about how much of my lifestyle I'd have to change to adapt to this thing. Turns out, very little. I can still leave stuff around if I want and it won't try to eat everything in its path. It does occasionally try to commit robot death on various cat toys the kitties leave about, but that's maybe one 1 out of 10 times it needs saving. I have a rug in my kitchen that it loves to push into a pile, but that's only a minor annoyance and doesn't cause it harm. I have to be careful not to leaving charging cords and such about. Once every couple weeks it won't find it's way all the way home, but it's usually pretty darn close to the charging station by the time it dies. I thought it might become inconvenient to ""save"" the unit from it's self-inflicted stupidity, but the value it provides exceeds the inconvenience. I can see why people like these things. And there's a good chance I may buy the three I need, maybe this one or maybe others. But, for now I'm pretty happy with this one. It's a 5 out of 5 cat toy and a pretty useful home appliance that will save you time and improve your home's upkeep. I'll update this review with any significant changing opinions, but for now this ""dumb, smart thing"" gets 5 stars. Update: About 4 months after running this thing daily, one of the side brush motors started to malfunction. Normally, a product malfunctioning that soon would irk me to reducing my review stars immediately, but I sucked it up and contacted support. I requested, specifically, to do a self repair of the brush motor right out of the gate. They didn't request for me to send it in for repair, demand an expensive cross shipped replacement or question my self-assessment to repair equipment that I owned. They just told me they have the part in stock, requested I send them a video of the problem, asked for the address and put the brush motor in the mail. They then confirmed that if this didn't make it work right, they would still support me until it did. They worked with me exactly how I wanted them to, stood behind their product 100% and for that, not even a single star will be reduced from my original review. Update 2: I knocked two stars from my review. Not because of the unit, which is still great, but because of the replacement air filters. They are $11 for TWO of them! That's nearly 3 times the price of the previous filters, or about a $65 annual operating cost when changing them out once a month. IMO, that's simply too expensive for a vacuum and even my high end upright isn't nearly that expensive to operate using *HEPA grade* vacuum bags. Not just that, they are incredibly terrible for the environment by requiring you to buy the substantial plastic filter housing every time. Had I known this at the time of my purchase, I would have selected a different unit - probably the initial version of the 11S. Final Update: I've decided to just let this thing die a slow and painful death. Both of my side brush motors went out, as did the one that I replaced. It's still marginally effective without them, but definitely not as good as having them. Eufy's support reached out to me several times, which was great, but I have better things to do than rip this thing apart every few months to fix plastic parts that will fail again in 3 months. I expect more from something I'm paying $200+ for, definitely not three of the same exact failures within a year. Oh, and there's much cheaper 3rd party filters available for this guy now.","Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2019"
B07R295MLS,3,Updated 1/28/2020 update 1/17/2020 It's been everything it was advertised to be and more. (Not),"I called Amazon again today. Explained the situation and that no one from Amazon or Eufy had returned my calls as they promised. Also after replacing the battery at my own expense it ran 90 minutes again but got stuck everywhere, made this weird ratcheting type noise every time it changed surfaces and finally today just beeped at me twice and died. Supposedly that indicates a seized brush but they all spin freely. This time I just flat out asked them to look at my Amazon account and replace it, as I'm a very good customer. New one will be here tomorrow. I'll do a separate review on that one as it took me forever to find this one again. I'll also let you know if it's a refurbished unit or not. Well wouldn't you know it. I leave a nice review and a few days later, Murphy's law rears it's ugly head. Device is 3 months old a couple weeks out of the exchange warranty and the battery is shot. Runs 5 or 10 minutes on a full charge. Called Amazon to see if since I am a really long standing customer if they'd help me out. Nope but we'll call Eufy support on your behalf and they will call you. We will also call you to follow up. I've been a customer service manager a lot of years and this is where employees can kill you. This Amazon person made me multiple promises. It's been a week no call from Eufy, no call from Amazon. You just turned 4 stars into 1 and if this is all the longer the batter lasts don't bother because the replacements are $25 to $30 bucks depending on the brand. I'm not spending a hundred bucks a year on batteries and this thing should be under warranty. After 3 days I ordered a new battery and Rosie is running again but I'm no longer pleased and the next time I'll buy another brand. If if this battery doesn't last the whole thing goes in the trash and I buy something else. I run this every day maybe the batteries won't take that I don't know. But if you're going to run it every day buy something else. This didn't last long enough at all. I wanted to wait a while to be sure I had a good sampling and could post a fair and useful review. It's been 90 days now. We have two large (bigger than standard) labradoodle puppies. 85 and 50 pounds and they're 1st generation so they shed a lot. They also, being puppies, have tore the yard up so it is basically a mud pit and they wrestle, run, and fight constantly. They put a lot of dirt and hair on the floors and in the air. We run ""Rosie"" every day. Yes my wife named it. It does an amazing job on our hardwood floors and throw rugs. It gets all the hair and an incredible amount of dust and dirt. What I mean by that is we can run our Dyson or the Shark Pet vacuum and then run Rosie and the chamber will be full of dust and dirt when she's done. It's almost disconcerting to know our very expensive upright vacuums leave so much behind. It also has the unadvertised ability to buff our hardwood floors. They shine when she's done and the beater brush is showing no signs of damaging the finish on our floors. I would disagree with some of the reviews and even the manufacturers assertion that it doesn't work well on dark floors. Our hardwood floors are a dark reddish brown. The device works great on them and as I said when it's finished they shine. We have agreed we will never be without one and love this device. It does everything it has been advertised to do and more. Also it is set to automatic power and runs longer than the advertised time on a full charge. We get about 2 hours and 15 minutes. We've put down an additional 6 throw rugs for the rainy snow season in the path where the dogs run when they come in and the time has dropped to around 90 to 100 minutes. Still long enough to cover everything well and more than once. It does keep going until it needs a charge it doesn't just run and go back to the dock. I've noticed in the open areas like our living room it might hit that 2 or even 3 times. The floors are like glass after that. Now for the negatives, and these are not deal breakers I'm just being fair. The dirt and dust I referred to is new to us. we recently moved from Illinois to Ohio. In Illinois the dirt is black. Here it is red or a very light brown. The vacuum gets externally dirty. It gets covered with dust/dirt and does not look good. The device is black and the dust is light colored and is readily apparent. I don't want to put it away all the time or for company so thats a problem for me and more cleaning which is not advertised so I'm mentioning it. Secondly it needs to be emptied every use or every other use. They are all like that except some of the super expensive robot vacuums so I wouldn't mention it except for my third negative. It is hard to clean from a mess standpoint. Not so much with the pet hair but with the dust. When you dump it the dust goes everywhere. Unless you have an empty trash can so you can get it way down inside when you're done the garbage can lid and sometimes the floor around the garbage can is clearly dusty from emptying the vacuum. The filters need to be removed at least every other running and they are also a big dusty mess. I also don't believe they will last as long as advertised. I have an air compressor in the garage and a hand held electric air compressor and use those to clean the filter. The foam piece I rinse in the sink. I don't think that someone without access to those tools is going to get the life out of the filters thats advertised. The device comes with a set of replacement filters and the rotating brushes. Not the beater bush though. Our unit is 3 months old. I had to replace the filters at about 40 days and tried to make them last a little longer this time but it hasn't worked out. The outside of the device is filthy. I believe this is due to the filters. The brushes have lasted longer than the suggested replacement time. They are 90 days old and still look like new. Last and has been a rare negative. The device will get stuck under things. Once I learned what the obstacles were in our home it was easy to fix. Some areas I blocked with rolled up moving blankets. I pull the chairs out from under the kitchen table to allow room for it to maneuver. If I don't it gets under there and spends way too much time cleaning and trying to get out. I'd rather it spend less time under there so it can do the whole cleaning area and have power left to do it again. I had the problem spots corrected and figured out within the first 30 days. I've read some units have a tape or something the vacuum will sense and avoid. I wish this unit had that but then again at this price point that is probably an unfair expectation. So those are the pro's and con's we've encountered. The con's are all minor irritants and not a reason not to buy the device as all of these devices are prone to these issues except one or two of the very very expensive units. To repeat what I said earlier this device has worked out so well we have decided that we will never be without one and that when the time comes to replace her we will not feel bad about spending the money for a high dollar unit as it is worth it. Time is worth more to us than money and this thing saves us a great deal of time. It does great job, has done no damage to anything, and if it weren't for the clean up issues would be a five star review. I hope this helps someone make an informed decision and I hope you buy one. It's an amazing little machine, stands up to all the reviews, and truly is the best bang for your buck in robot vacuums.","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2020"
B07R295MLS,3,It's ok - not magic,"I will start this off by saying that I have laughed at the thought of these vacuums. We have 2 newfoundlands, a malamute/shepherd mix, 2 cats, and 4 humans in this house. My Dyson pet vac? Lasted a year. The Shark pet vac? Also a year. I have never been under the assumption that this kind of vacuum would work in my house. I was right. Duh. However.....we bought this because it was half off and we enjoy cute gadgets. We thought that maybe, if we ran it every day, that it could pick up a little bit and my regular vacuuming wouldn't be such an emergency situation every few days. I think it actually has helped a little bit! It definitely picks up some stuff and my regular vacuuming has not struck me as an OMG MUST DO IT RIGHT NOW thing. If you are a control freak (like me) you can't watch this. There is no way to program where it goes - you just have to watch it do one line through one room then make it's way to another room as you sit and stare at the spot of dirt that it just totally went right on by. You can block off it's exits - but the entire point of a robot vacuum is that I'm NOT doing the work - that includes furniture moving. Since this is not my main vacuum, I'm learning to let it go. Even on the highest setting, the suction is not great. I bought this because of all of the reviews saying how awesome the suction was and how it cleaned people's floors so well...no. Maybe that was the super expensive version? I didn't (don't) understand what the differences are with all of the very differently priced options available. What I am reviewing is (at the time) the cheapest option. The suction is horrid. I have watched it go over hardwood and not pick up little bits - it didn't even need to go through a carpet and it still missed them. but..... It DOES pick something up, the box fills and I empty it. It does stop and beep at me pretty regularly to clean the brush as it is full of dog fur, but that's fine - every vacuum has that issue in my house. We finally just started turning the power completely off because it will just randomly start. After 27 years, we finally had the tv moment in the house where I (wife) heard a noise and frantically woke the husband up to go check on it. *punch punch* ""Honey! The robot is vacuuming - it's ALIVE"" - this has happened 4 or 5 times so far at totally random times - nothing is programmed. So - that is weird lol! But fixable. TLDR: In all....It's not as good as I hoped, but it is about what I expected. It may work well in a no pet house. Don't expect beautiful vacuum lines, you won't get them.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"
B07R295MLS,3,Ok you have a small home with no pets you might be ok....Eufy Customer service is top notch.,"First let me say I'm comparing this C20 vac robot's performance compared to my two other Shark vacuum/mop robots that I have owned for multiple years. This robot does do a good job of vacuuming the floor and it also does a good job of mopping the floor. The picture shows what this robot mopped up after my iRobot m6 went first. The noise level of the robot is what I consider average during cleaning in normal mode. I have not bothered to try turbo yet. That is about all I can say good about this robot. It takes over 9 hours and 5, yes 5 recharges to do my house. The Shark can do it on a single charge and in about 1 hours and 20 minutes. I do have a Border Collie, and she does shed, but it's winter time where she's not shedding much at this time, and it is still too much for the vacuum to empty itself properly with out clogging. The self-cleaning brush roll does a pretty good job, but still leaves clumps and the edges collect a lot of hair. The C20 seems to be in a hurry to get back to work and only allows itself a 30% to 40% charge before returning to cleaning. This allows it to clean one room, possibly two before having to return to charge again. While the brushes do lift when the C20 leaves the hard floor to transition onto a carpet, the mops still seems to rub along the edge and leave a different pattern. The carpet doesn't feel wet but definitely looks different. I'm a big fan of Eufy products for being good quality for the price, but I think this one was a swing and a miss, unless you live in a small house or apartment with no pets... Edit to add: Tested ""turbo"" mode on my living room. It took over 5 hours with several recharges to vacuum for just over 1 hour. The battery on this vac is way under sized. Edit to add: I have been contacted by Eufy Customer service, they have gone over the top to try and make things better for me. I'm still a big fan of the Eufy/Anker brand and will continue to be.

B07R295MLS,3,Quit on me in only seven days! -- Battery not keeping a charge!,"Nov 20, 2024 CORRECTION. Return canceled. While cleaning up the eufy 11S for packing and return, I found a thin thread that had neatly balled up my GSD's fur under the brush. I SWAG that the bind caused the eufy to use more power as it worked, or would stop it dead until the battery failed. Once I cleaned up the brush, vacuumed out the bin, and left it to charge, the eufy 11s ran for its hour of vacuum time. So, operator error. The battery is good. Nov 19, 2024 The replacement eufy Robot Vacuum 11S Max issued by Amazon. This robot was delivered the 23rd of October. At first, it was fine. It would vacuum and park itself. It is much quieter than the Roomba in my bedroom. However, after a couple of weeks, it vacuumed and didn't park. Around the 10th of November, I began timing it. It would die in about 20 minutes. The time kept dropping and as of today, it did not make just 10 minutes. My friend has two eufys and they have been wonderful for a couple of years. I am guessing eufy got a bad batch of batteries. I haven't given up . . . yet. I will order another. YMMV Oct 22, 2024. The eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX. I noticed on the 3rd day that the robot had not parked itself. I put it on the stand. Same thing the 4th day. Today, the 7th day, it ran for one minute. 4 beeps and flashing red says it needs a charge. I charge it 12 to 24 hours per day. To all appearances, the battery is failing to charge. Pity, since it did a good job and is way quieter than my Roomba 690. I am returning it for replacement. Pros - the eufy doesn't require you to hook it up to the internet, nor does it require your location. It is very quiet - in fact, when it gets stuck, you need a quiet house to find it. The remote is easy to use and programming is a snap. The clean up is very good. I have cats and dogs and it picks up their hair and litter Cons - The afore-mentioned battery. Ran for two hours the first day. I was looking forward to it staying with me. Day 3 to Day 7, it died in minutes. Charge 12 - 24 hours every day.

B07R295MLS,3,"good at cleaning, but not reliable","I've wanted a robot vacuum for a long time. I have a 750 sq ft apartment that is wood and tile flooring except for two small rugs. I have 2 cats and usually need to sweep every 2-3 days, but dust bunnies pile up in some places like crazy. It seems like the perfect space for a little robovac. But I always thought they were either a.) really expensive, or b.) cheap and ineffective. A friend posted how much she loved her robovac on her snapchat and I responded and we got to talking. She then sent me a link to the 11s which had over 26K reviews, high ratings, and also was perfectly within the range of money I'd be willing to spend for a robovac. After reading those and other product reviews, I ended up getting the 11s MAX as it sounded slightly better, easier to clean filters, and the price difference between the 11s and 11s max wasn't much. I got my little robovac charged up and on its inaugural trip around my apartment it went straight for the dirtiest spots - under my kitchen table and under the entertainment stand. By the time it had run itself low and was ready to return home, my place looked almost spotless and the floors were super clean. Usually no matter how much I sweep there are always some gritty bits that I feel on my feet when I walk around. I haven't had that problem since I started running this! I ran it daily for a week and it brought home an almost full container of pet hairs and grit and other stuff. I'm in the second week and I think that, based on what it returns with, I can get by with running it every other day. My floors are super clean, especially the edges where things tend to pile up. It's made a noticeable difference and I'm super happy with this purchase. I will note that you do need to prep spaces a little before running. I always pick up cat toys, make sure cords are out of the way, move chairs so it can better reach under my table, etc. But it takes me less than 5 min to do this and put things back in order when it's done cleaning. It also can't reach everywhere, but since it cleans everywhere it CAN reach so thoroughly (including places I can't reach without significantly rearranging my furniture, like under my kitchen table), this lets me focus on the smaller areas where it can't reach and my daily manual cleaning is pretty minimal. I can also sweep out these dusty nooks and crannies into the center of the room and it picks it up better than I can do with a dustpan and the broom. I'm surprised and pleased with how well this handles my rugs too. I used to take them outside and shake them out once a month and I would wash my bathroom mats in the laundry machine. I thought that the mats and the rug in my bedroom would be too thick/high for this but actually they're not. It does push around the bathroom mats some, but it gets them clean too. It also cleans the bedroom rug very well and can make it across easily enough. The other area rug I have is low pile and it feels so much better with daily cleanings rather than monthly shake outs. Some (minor) drawbacks I've noticed: - The amount of space its docking station requires is annoying. There is only 1 outlet in my whole place that can sort of accommodate it. But it has trouble because the outlet is near a doorway and this causes the device a lot of confusion. It will start heading for this station but upon passing the door threshold it gets confused and moves back and forth like it's searching and if I don't catch it then it will start wandering way off course. It generally has a lot of problems finding its way home in general, if it needs recharging when it's on the other side of my apartment from it's home then it wanders aimlessly and gets stuck somewhere. It needs to be guided manually to within 3 feet of the dock before it can properly home. - I have wires under my entertainment consoles that were pressed up against the wall. This has slowly worked them loose over the last 2 weeks and now it gets tangled 4-5 times during each run. I need help moving the furniture to get to the cords (and so far no one has been available to help), so this ends up being supremely annoying. - I have wood floors, probably a medium shade of wood, but when it's sunny out I notice that the device sometimes gets ""trapped"" by sunbeams and beeps for help because it gets ""stuck"". - The robovac pushes some things around. It moves the bathroom mats around (not really a huge problem) but also knocks into the cat bowls and scoots them around into odd places. Overall I'd highly recommend this. The minor drawbacks are seriously outweighed by the sheer convenience of this robovac and how thoroughly it keeps my place clean. EDIT: So after almost a month, it started running very loudly. The troubleshooting options offered by eufy weren't great, nor is their return program easy, so returned to Amazon. Hopefully the new one doesn't start making grinding/roaring noises. Another edit: The one sent as a replacement has a bad battery and has to go back too.","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2020"
B07R295MLS,3,Perfect for a perfectly square room and that’s about it,"My house is very simple. Lots of straight lines and not a lot of furniture, I’m quite a minimalist. Which is why I thought any robot vacuum would work. But I was wrong. Pros: vacuums around round things very well, and the suction works nicely - it really does pick up stuff well and gets all the dust from my bird off my LVP Cons: it doesn’t map, which I don’t really understand how you can have a robot vacuum that doesn’t map because it will NEVER understand where it has been and where it hasn’t. This vacuum, after running on auto for about 20 minutes, vacuumed the same two spots in my house repeatedly, missing a lot of spots. When it hits a wall, it either determines that the wall will keep going (and just vacuums along the wall, going a completely different direction when the wall ends) or it turns around 180 degrees and goes the other direction but diagonally so it literally misses everything and just follows the same path it was just on. It hates rugs, so despite the advertising saying it could go from hard wood to a low pile rug, that was incorrect. It got caught up on two of my rugs and the brush fell off. For some reason, it got stuck in my foyer just going back and forth repeatedly about 10 times before it finally left that room, only to return back to it after a spin in my kitchen (where it missed 90% of the floor?) and ended up getting stuck in that same spot in my foyer. Why did it go back to my foyer when it already vacuumed there? No mapping, that’s why. I don’t really understand owning a robot vacuum that you have to keep an eye on. The reason you own one is so you can move on with your other chores or life responsibilities. You might as well just pick up your own vacuum and do your own floor if you’re just gonna have to follow this robot around everywhere.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"
B07R295MLS,3,"Limited Reliability Very Disappointing """"Customer Support"" UPDATE: CUSTOMER SUPPORT CAME THROUGH","I was initially impressed with this unit; it actually exceeded my expectations in terms of suction and also quietness. I bought it around 9 months ago and use(d) it once per week on average. While the unit can be left to roam on its own to clean, I have found that it is (a) very inefficient in that mode, taking forever and still missing a few spots, and (b) invariably gets itself stuck - under furniture, around power cords, or at a small floor lip between rooms that it simply can't make it over. As a result, I simply started using the remote to direct it each time I cleaned. Much quicker and obviously no issues with it getting stuck. About four weeks ago the unit started randomly changing its cleaning mode while I was operating it. For example, while I would have it in ""edge cleaning"" mode, it would - without any input from me - go into auto cleaning mode, leaving it's edging path and heading straight into the middle of a room. The inverse has also happened. While directing it to clean in a straight line, it would suddenly start turning and heading towards a wall, and then engage in edge cleaning. While bothersome, these issues weren't really that big a deal to me - it just meant I had to hit some buttons on a remote control a couple of more times than I should have had to. But then the quirky behavior REALLY took a turn for the worse. At 3 a.m. one morning a week and a half ago, my wife and I were awakened by the sound of rustling in our house. Our first thought (and fear) was burglary. I cautiously started exploring and found that the noise was actually the Eufy going around in circles in our bedroom closet. It had obviously self-activated and gotten itself trapped. I put it back in the charging dock and returned to bed, hoping this aberration would be a one-off experience. It wasn't. (Before I continue, I want to say that the first, and most obvious, thought I had was that somehow the timer had gotten set. I doubted it, since I've never once used the timer, but I checked the remote display anyway. There was no timer indicator to be seen, but to be sure I removed the remote batteries and then reset it.) The next night, and the night after that, the Eufy self-activated just before midnight. I contacted Eufy Customer Service in writing, explaining what was happening and asking if there was anything I could to stop the unit spontaneously coming on at unacceptable hours, and to resolve the mode-changing glitches. I received an automated reply assigning me a case number and telling me that I could expect to hear from them within 24 hours. With Covid-19, I figured it could take longer than that - maybe even 3 or 4 days - but it's now been more than a week and I've not heard a word. (I did a lot of web research, including chat rooms, and based on problems other people were having I disconnected the unit's power for a day and then turned it back on. That seems to have fixed the self-activation (at least for now), but the unit still changes modes spontaneously.) Very disappointed with lack of customer support, but I guess I'll just take the attitude that it wasn't very expensive and I got several good months out of it. There may be another robotic vacuum in my future (when suction, dust-bin capacity, and reliability all improve), but it most likely won't be a Eufy. To end on a positive note, though, I will say that the physical engineering of this unit is impressive, and that I've never had any issue with battery longevity. Always enough power to do all our rooms in sequence. UPDATE 8/19/20. Eufy reached out to me after I posted my review. They could not explain why there was no response to my initial message, but they apologized and handled everything professionally from there. They are sending a new remote contro, as they believe that is the cause of my issues.. (They offered to send a brand new vacuum, but I thought that was overkill since the self-activation issue has not recurred for the past 2 weeks.). We shall see. Also, I was pleased to be able to deal with the same customer service representative each time. That is very rare these days in my experience. Cecilia was very helpful and expedited resolution of my issues. She also agreed that if the vacuum begins to self-activate in the future, they will replace the unit even if it is then out of warranty, since the problem originally surfaced while the warranty was still in effect. Can't ask for more than that. So.....the unit, when it works well, would be 4 to 5 stars, but since it's had various issues I can only give it 3 stars for now. (If the new remote fixes the problems, I'll upgrade the stars.). But a genuine 5 stars for their Customer Service - they have turned my opinion around completely.","Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2020"

I thought it would entertaining, even relaxing to watch it wander aimlessly around.

B07R295MLS,3,"Good little vacuum, but don't expect it to be a Roomba","I've been in the market for a robot vacuum for years, but the cost has always stopped me. When I found the Eufy I was so excited to finally find a budget-friendly robot vacuum! And bonus - it got excellent reviews ! I decided to bite the bullet and give this one a try. We were also given an older version of the Roomba (594) , so I've compared the Eufy to the older Roomba . Now first off , we have a large one story house , with a small portion down 4 stairs. So our house is a lot of square feet on mostly one level, in a U shape. I assumed and understood that the Eufy (or any robot vacuum) wouldn't be able to cover the whole house, so I purchased the Eufy for our main living area which is roughly 1500 sq. Feet. Here are a few things to keep in mind: - You get what you pay for. Yes, the Eufy is a great price, but I also discovered the suction is about half as strong as our older Roomba. It will pick up the big stuff in our medium pile carpet but doesn't grab deep. Which brings me to... - Works great on hard wood floors, not so great on carpet. Maybe if you had really low pile carpet, but we have two types of carpet, one medium pile shag type carpet and another thick but low pile carpet, and the Eufy doesn't do great on either. However it performs well on hardwood floors, eventually picking up most of the debris floating around the floor. - it doesn't seem to hit all the area. Even with being confined to a smaller section of my house (approx. 1500 sq. Ft.) The Eufy struggles to get all the stuff on the floor. - the vacuum pattern is random. This probably doesn't help with it's inability to cover all the area. But I was willing to overlook this with the lower price. - This vacuum is incredibly quiet, especially when compared to the Roomba . - It's low enough to fit under some of my furniture, which is nice. - compared to the Roomba , it gets stuck a more often . But I think that's because it's lower profile allows it to try to go under furniture it has no business being under . With a little babysitting , it's not much of an issue . - it navigates transitional floor pieces from room to room with ease. We have a few floow transitions that are at least half an inch tall, and the Eufy has no problem clearing them - if you want it to thoroughly cover an area, expect to babysit it. I'm constantly having to redirect my Eufy to make sure it hits the spots I want it to hit. - with a bigger house , plan to buy two , or at the very least constantly move it around. We have the old Roomba set up in separate area of our house so our Eufy only has one, staright forward , albeit large , area to cover. - this thing does not dock on its own. Therefore, when it runs out of charge it just dies , which often leads to a hunt to find the lost Eufy . Not much of an issue if you plan to babysit it, but might prove problematic if you want to run it at night. - the charge: my Eufy runs about 75 minutes (yes, I've timed it), which I believe is 25 minutes less than what it's advertised at. Might be due to the carpet / hardwood combo - I end up needing to run my Eufy every day, sometimes multiple times per day, with still sections missed . This is due to the fact that we have 5 kids and a dog constantly tracking stuff into the house. But it's also because the Eufy doesn't effectively cover the whole area. Again, you get what you pay for. - because of the things I've listed , I wouldnt run my Eufy at night. ALL IN ALL... I'd still purchase the Eufy again. It does a decent job for it's price point. If you don't mind babysitting it to get a more thorough job done and to make sure the thing docks to recharge, and also realize that it won't take the place of vacuuming but just help you get through until the next time you vacuum, you'll probably be happy with this purchase. And hey, you can't beat the price!","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2019"
B07R295MLS,3,Too many limitations,"I can’t really evaluate this product because I never used it, but I did read the manual and saw it wouldn’t work in my house. Before letting the sweeper do its thing you have to tuck in the fringes of your rugs, and remove the wires from the floor. Then I looked at the spaces between chairs and chair legs that would prevent the sweeper from moving under or between them, and concluded I would still have to drag out my Kenmore canister to finish the cleaning. In addition, it’s pretty heavy and I have two levels to clean. (I have a lightweight cleaner downstairs, so I would still have manual work to do.)

B07R295MLS,3,OK for some purposes,"So I waited to post until I really had some time to use this machine. To give you a sense of my situation, I wanted something inexpensive that would help me with cat hair and just clean the lower level/basement space. And, Wirecutter from the NYT recommended this one so I thought that was good enough for me. I paid $150 so that's pretty great, right? Yes, if it works well enough to match the price. Overall, I'd say yes. Also, I have the LTV flooring and the lower level space is wide open. It's a perfect space and it should be easy enough for an inexpensive machine. I'm not sure how it would work in other spaces but I'd think in a similar way. OK, let's get to it. At the start I found the product really annoying. It vacuums like it is drunk. It hits something and bounces off into another direction. There is seemingly no clear plan overall for the machine. As others have noted, it does not record a floor map. Which is ok, but the drunken bit is an impediment because I cannot tell if it quite got the whole room or area. It is quiet. You do have to empty the machine and filter. That is fine with me. I want to see what it picks up. It is not run by an app but by a remote like you would use for a tv. That's not a dealbreaker for me. You can schedule it to clean each day. I’ve had this machine for a few months now and I use it everyday. Not kidding. Everyday to clean the same area and it does what I need it to do. but it does. Overall, it does what I want to do. Drunkenly, but it does. As a result, we named it Kronos because Kronos ate a rock thinking it was Zeus. Kronos is not smart. So, there you go. But it works well enough for my needs.

B07R295MLS,3,Good until it’s not,Bought this in 2022… has held up well until now when it has now started to turn off intermittently again even after charging and cleaning all components - this happened to our previous model also.

B07R295MLS,3,"Doesn't Require an App, But Does Require Babysitting","I saw so many reviews on how many people ""love their Eufy"" that when I had to replace my old Deebot, I decided to try a Eufy. The main selling points for me were 1) doesn't require an app, 2) low clearance, 3) positive reviews on suction power, 4) price. While I know a lot of people like having an app that allows them to control their robot vacume cleaners, I'd rather have one that I can push a button and it goes about its job without supervision. For me, that's the whole point of having a robot - it does what it's supposed to do without my having to think about it and/or monitor it after I've picked up the floor. This one comes with a remote control, which is kinda cool, but again, only if you want to have to monitor and/or direct it. When I got this vacume cleaner, I set it up and pushed the On button to do a test run. I was surprised at how random the path it vacumed was - it entered most rooms, vacumed 2 paths at a 90 degree angle to each other, then left the room! I thought it might do better with a full charge, so returned it to its charging dock in the laundry room. Without my programming it, it started bumping around in the laundry room several hours later, so I let it loose and watched it to see what it would do. I was surprised that it vacumed over the Exact Same Paths it had already vacumed, and ignored every other part of the rooms and hallways! I experimented with the remote for a while, to see if I could get it to be more thorough, but quickly got frustrated with the need to babysit a robot, so let its programming take over. I was surprised and disappointed that it kept vacuming the paths it had already covered. I thought that perhaps the repetitive paths were part of it mapping my house, so tried it a third time - and found it kept vacuming the Exact Same Paths Over and Over while ignoring the rest of the rooms. What was even more frustrating was that it typically only vacumed 4 paths in each room before moving on to the next. I can say that it did only a decent job picking up lint, hair and dirt on the first pass, but need to point out it kept picking up lint, hair and dirt, on every other pass it did over the exact same paths, so it's not great at cleaning either. I cleaned it, packed it up and returned it. Did some more digging and bought a Roborock which has a better understanding of what a robot is supposed to do. So far, so good with that purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2023"
B07R295MLS,3,"Ok for me, not so ok for my 86 yr old mom","Internet a must, removing items underneath furniture is a must, setting up is not easy, setting timer is not easy, none not easy for my mom who I bought it for to make floor vacuuming easy 😑","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"
B07R295MLS,3,"a little frustrating, needs babysitting","product claim: different 'versatile' modes. actual: sort of. Spot clean does a spiral until it bumps something and goes into auto. Edge mode is nice but will keep doing the same edges until you set another mode. Auto and Quick clean have no discernable difference. Auto and quick clean both switch between edges and wander so often that it ends up cleaning the edges 8 times while leaving debris in the center of the room. Product claim: boost IQ suction control. actual: I haven't seen it adjust to much to bigger messes. It stays pretty steady in boost IQ mode. Since a larger mess requiring more suction is a job for the spot clean mode, this seems pointless. All modes that aren't AUTO engage the fan to high or need user to set it. This includes spot clean. Product claim: good for animal/human hair actual: This does get hair off the ground, but it all just winds up on the brush, so be ready to cut hair out of the brush a lot, like way a lot. Once there is a lot of hair in the brush, it seriously impacts its ability to remove debris larger than dust motes. My impression: I babysit this more than I should have to. I've seen bounce nav robot vacs in this price range at least keep track of where its been. This will vac the same corner a hundred times while leaving dust in the center of the room. Its constantly getting itself stuck. In order to get it to complete a room, like the kitchen, to my satisfaction, i have to wall it into the kitchen and guide it through its modes one by one, then after about 45 minutes it does an adequate job. My kitchen takes me about 3 minutes to sweep myself. Evaluate how much you practically need this before you buy it. It doesn't save a whole lot of time, effort, or money. I wish things like this would receive regular firmware updates as reviews start to come in and people identify potential issues.","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2024"
B07R295MLS,3,"Better at vacuuming than I imagined, too dumb to use in my house.","While I was initially impressed by how well it cleans, I ended up returning this and bought a lidar guided one from a different brand. My biggest problems were that this unit made no effort to avoid furniture and would bash into my furniture legs much harder than I was comfortable with. Lighter weight objects, like end tables or decorations, would be moved around or knocked over. Additionally, it would wedge itself under my couch and need to be rescued every single time I used it. While I only tried the feature once, it could not find it's way back to the dock to charge. As far as I could tell, it would just wander aimlessly, bashing from wall to wall, hoping to eventually stumble upon the dock. It didn't even know what direction to go. I do have some positives. The unit did clean better than I expected. It could easily traverse from hard floors to carpet, and would adjust the suction power automatically. It could navigate over flooring transitions easily, and seemed good about getting itself unstuck, except when it went under my couch. It was also very easy to set up and empty the dust container. Overall, this might be fine for a first apartment or dorm filled with cheap furniture (or better yet, no furniture), but it didn't work for me.","Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024"

B07R295MLS,3,Not very impressed. Old roomba was iRobot 655.,"My new Eufy 11s Robot Vacuum ran for the first time tonight. I have it running for a second time now (at midnight!). It is much quieter than my iRobot 655. But I'm not that impressed. I probably should have spent the money for the max version. It is not picking up the yarn strings from the cats picking at my bath rugs/cat trees. It is still dumb (no wifi and random pickup pattern) but does seem better at navigating than my old iRobot. It definitely senses edges better and avoids running into things. But it also gets stuck on items/in spots more easily. It has 2 side brushes instead of one. But only has one very soft bristled brush with a few rows of bristles. The iRobot 655 had one bristled brush (full bristle all around) and one rubber. I'm thinking the second rubber roller made a big difference. The suction power on the Eufy is 2x the irobot (1300pa vs 600pa) but I think the irobot would have picked up those yarn pieces better. I've already had to clean the brush twice because of fuzz/cat hair/human hair buildup. It seems to have a lower tolerance of buildup compared to the iRobot brushes. The collection tray seems smaller than the iRobot's but Eufy's is easier to open and empty and clean. Scheduling via the remote is sufficient for me. I don't need a wifi connected one. Scheduling was much easier than the iRobot where you have to press buttons and hope the settings take. Oh and my cats are intrigued by it. They followed it around and let it get pretty close to them considering it is new. The noise didn't seem to bother them that much. But they did get used to the old loud iRobot. I have carpet everywhere except the kitchen and bathrooms. It is cheapo, builder grade carpet. I got this for the prime day sale so the value is decent enough. My 3 year old iRobot (that cost 2x as much) doesn't run longer than a few minutes now. I've already replaced the parts in it once and wasn't quite motivated to do it a second time. I may do it now since the eufy basic model isn't very impressive. Edit: it took 2 days for this review to get approved. I've run it at least 5 more times. Even changed cleanup mode to max suction for every run. Overall opinion hasn't changed. I need to clean out the brush after every run. It does not tolerate long human hair or general fur/fuzz well. It does charge quickly. It is still quiet on max suction (compared to the irobot). The side brushes already look pretty beat up and do not look like they will last long. It does pick up stuff. The bin is full every run. It does not tell you when the bin is full. Edit 7/23: less than a week after it arriving, one of the side brushes already fell off while running. I plan on returning the unit. The side brushes just snap on and off but I don't want to have to hunt them down in my place all of the time. Edit 8/27: I cancelled my return. Part laziness. Part I realized how little my old roomba really did pick up (after I fixed it). I keep it on max suction now. All of the stuff in wrote earlier still applies. Gets stuck easier. Side brushes fall off if it catches something the wrong way. Not great at picking up larger items (but does do better on max suction). Brush needs to be cleaned every day. Higher maintenance. But does an ok job at suction for the prime day price. I would followed through with the return if I had paid full price.","Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2019"
B07R295MLS,3,good for touch-up in between your major vacuuming,"This is my first experience with a robot vacuum. Some of my issues are probably with this type of vacuum in general, and not with this machine. I bought this one because it was on sale and had good reviews. I also just recently replaced some carpet in my home with tile and wanted something that would help me stay ahead of the dog and cat hair that drifts around on the tile. I charged the unit and turned it loose on the auto setting to clean my living room, dining room, kitchen, a bathroom, and a hall (all tile) and one bedroom (carpet). My first impression is that the unit just runs around randomly until it runs out of battery power. How well an area gets cleaned depends on how long the battery lasts. I could see wheel marks all over the bedroom, so it looks like the coverage in there was good, but I also saw a clump of hair left behind. When the vacuum was done, I expected to find a very full dust bin, but I would say it was about half full. My upright vacuum would have gotten 5 times as much just from the bedroom. If you have small throw rugs you will find the device can handle a low pile one like you might have inside an entry door but hangs up on a higher pile one like you might have in a bathroom. I have some speakers that sit on the floor next to my entertainment center. I can pull them out so the vacuum can go behind, but then the speaker cord is a problem. I can shove them back against the wall, but then pet hair hides behind them. I am not sure if it was able to get under all my dining room chairs. It could fit between their legs if it came from the side, but not from the front or back. There are just many places a human using a cleaning tool would get to because they would pick up or move items as they cleaned. The robot can't do that. It also does not get the hair behind and under my couch. I can stick the wand of my canister vacuum back there. I do not see this as a replacement for the two different vacuums I use on my carpet and tile. But I can see running it in the middle of the week. It is quiet, so you can still do things like watch TV while it is operating. My cat and dog were interested at first, but the dog was soon ignoring it and the cat just hid. The instructions say you should use a vacuum to clean the filters, so even if you love this, you still need another vacuum. There is a foam filter that is so thin your vacuum will suck it right up if you are not careful. <UPDATE> The same day I posted my review and I already got an email from eufy saying they are sorry I am disappointed in their product and suggesting some things I can check to make sure my machine is working to its full potential. (Make sure the brushes had not gotten jammed with pet hair and stopped spinning, set to max suction, etc.) They point out that ""mapping"" is not available on the model I bought so the machine does appear to move randomly, but will eventually cover the area. They do tell me, ""Robot vacuums do not entirely replace the need for manual cleaning and are not a complete substitute for traditional vacuums. They greatly reduce the frequency and effort needed for regular cleaning."" Thanks eufy for your response. I will give it some more time and see if I want to upgrade my review. <UPDATE #2> Having used this vacuum for several months, I have decided to stand by my 3 star review. One new thing to add. I have twice been woken in the middle of the night by this vacuum running when I had not activated it. It does have a remote control, so maybe a neighbor's garage door opener is on the same frequency and is turning it on if that neighbor is coming home at 3 AM.","Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2018"

B07R295MLS,3,WILL NOT WORK ON AREA RUGS WITH PATCHES OF BLACK IN THE DESIGN,"Overall, I don't regret buying this. At my house, takes a bit of prep work to keep the vac away from cords and from getting caught under a couple of pieces of furniture, so i don't run it every day. For the type of vac it is, it does a decent job. Would give it 2 ½ stars if I could. Problem is, there are two high traffic areas it doesn't vacuum. The first: large parts of the 9x12 area rug in the living room. The rug is a dark multi-color traditional Persian pattern, with a central medallion outlined in black and a 2"" black border around the perimeter of the rug. Eufy does NOT work on black areas of the rug. I think it has to do with the drop sensors—they seem to read black as if it is a stair step, and it will NOT go over those areas. Which is bad, since these areas always need vacuuming. Even with the remote, it will not go over those areas. Sometimes it will not cross over the perimeter at all, sometimes it will. It will not cross the border around the medallion, so never vacuums the central portion of the rug unless I pick it up and put it in the central portion, and then it will never leave that portion because of the black border. I watched half a dozen Eufy vac videos before purchasing this one, and NONE of them mention that it will NOT vacuum black carpet. The second problem area is in the kitchen, also always a messy floor that needs frequent vacuuming. I have 4 ""anti-fatigue"" rubbery kitchen mats that are 1/2"" in height. Necessary for bad knees on a tile-on-concrete floor. The mats have beveled edges that are 2"" wide. I lay them end to end in the work areas of the kitchen. This creates a 4"" wide ""valley"" of sorts where the ends of the mats meet. Eufy frequently gets stuck on those valley areas. The third main problem is cleaning the paper filter. In older models (see youtube videos), eufy had a screen or foam filter covering the paper filter. In this one, it is just the paper filter—and it was filthy after just one run. I can tap out some of the dust on the edge of the trash can, but the only way to clean it well is to blow compressed air through it. The air compressor is in the garage, and I'm just not going to mess w/ that step very often. Also not willing to replace the filter on a weekly basis. All the video reviews go on about how quiet this model is; well, compared to my upright vac, it is a bit quieter, but I wouldn't want it running around while sleeping. Definitely not very quiet. But then, bec it does get stuck periodically, I'm not comfortable letting it run while I'm away, either. I find myself having to re-direct or un-stick the vac several times during a run. One point in its favor: this particular model does not demand a learning curve. There's one switch, one button on the vac itself, and a straightforward remote. You don't have to be into computer coding to operate the thing. It may vacuum randomly, but you can always use the edge mode or the circular mode or the manual direction arrows to be sure a particular area is covered. And you don't have to download any apps that spy on your smartphone calendar or geographical whereabouts or contacts, etc. No robotic vac can take the place of manual vacuuming. If you have light-colored carpet and rugs, you won't have problem #1. If you don't have anti-fatigue mats, you won't have problem #2. You will have problem #3 with this model. I wouldn't say don't buy it necessarily, but consider these points before you do.","Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2020"

B07R295MLS,3,This vacuum sucks,"As a vacuum cleaner, the Eufy 11S is not great. If you think of it as a carpet sweeper, you'll be happier. On my bedroom 3/8” pile carpet, it swept up dust, but not lint. It did a fine job on the entry mat near the back door, but that has no pile whatsoever. It's probably best to run this vacuum frequently to gather the surface dust and maybe any loose lint. On successive runs, it will gather dust it missed the first time. I ran it on a hardwood floor in one of the other bedrooms, and I was surprised how much dust it got on the 2nd day. You really need to robot-proof your room. The vacuum hates loose wires, like the ones you have behind the couch that are attached to the rear speakers. Any drapes or curtains need to be tied up so the vacuum does not get tangled. It has a problem with sloping surfaces, such as the rocking chair rockers or my clothes valet that has feet that slope to the floor. The area rug in my family room gave it a problem, since the combination of the rug and the mat was too high. The vacuum started to climb up onto the rug, then got stuck and could not go any further. When I vacuum this room, I take the rug off the mat, and that works. I would suggest you observe the vacuum in each room the first time to figure out what the obstacles will be. If you don't have any carpets or rugs, and you don't have a lot of stuff on the floor, this might be the right vacuum for you. It would be a definite time saver. But be sure to empty the dust bin often. The Eufy 11S is easy to use; the remote works just fine. The unit is easy to dismantle and clean. A small brush comes with the unit, but I found that an old toothbrush works even better. It never fell off the stair landing. It's quiet. I did not try the timed programming feature. This vacuum takes 4 or 5 hours to recharge, so you will have to manage that. Don't throw out your upright vacuum, since that will do a more thorough job on carpets and rugs with even a minimal pile. Don't throw out your shop vac, since you will need that for stairs. And you can use it to clean out the Eufy. When the Eufy 11S breaks, and it's out of warranty, I will not get it fixed. Maybe a different brand or model will work better. I would not buy this again.","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2021"
B07R295MLS,3,"""Eufy: A Disastrous Dance of Debris, Disappointment, and Despair""","Eufy, oh Eufy, where do I even begin with this so-called ""robotic vacuum""? From the moment I laid eyes on it, I knew it was destined to be a disappointment. Its sleek design may be visually appealing, but it's nothing more than a facade to mask its utter lack of cleaning prowess. Let's talk about its ""intelligence"" – or rather, the lack thereof. Eufy seems to have a knack for getting stuck on the simplest obstacles, like a lost child in a maze. Oh, there's a chair leg? Better stop dead in its tracks and beep for help. And don't even get me started on its so-called mapping capabilities. It's as if Eufy is navigating blindfolded, randomly bumping into walls and furniture, leaving swathes of untouched dirt in its wake. The promises of efficient cleaning and time-saving convenience fall flat on their face. It takes Eufy an eternity to cover even a modestly-sized room, all the while leaving behind visible dirt and debris. It's supposed to be a ""hands-free"" solution, but in reality, you'll find yourself constantly rescuing it from its own misadventures. The quality of its cleaning is equally underwhelming. Rather than effectively lifting and sucking up dirt, Eufy seems to do little more than push it around, leaving behind a messy trail like a toddler playing with a broom. And let's not forget the incredibly loud noise it emits, turning any cleaning session into an auditory assault. Oh, and did I mention the notorious issue of Eufy getting tangled up in cords and pet hair? It's as if it has a magnetic attraction to anything that could disrupt its feeble attempts at cleaning. In conclusion, Eufy is a perfect example of style over substance. It may look like a high-tech marvel, but its performance is nothing short of laughable. Save your hard-earned money and invest in a reliable, capable robotic vacuum from a reputable brand. Eufy is a frustrating, ineffective waste of space that falls short of even the most basic expectations.","Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2023"

They stood by their product and made it right with me, so I must say I am very pleased with the company and their service. Previous review: I bought this vacuum cleaner with the highest of expectations because my daughter had one that worked well. She purchased hers sometime prior. This one I bought was the same brand and model, but it has been a terrible disappointment. It goes right over top of dust clumps, and leaves them and other debris on the floor in its tracks. It does not have an effective intuitive path to cover the entire room, either. I have put it on the optional maximum setting, but to no avail.

B07R295MLS,3,"Like a drunken toddler, only slightly worse.","Although quieter than some other models by a major brand, this robot lacks the programming and features you get with a more expensive, more familiar brand offering. First, this vacuum has only fully finished scheduled events less than 10% of the time. We are routinely returning home to the start of our ritual “where is it now” game of seeking out the stuck vacuum. This robot does not include barrier devices to divert it from entering areas you’d rather not have it running like other big name brand models. Instead it will go anywhere it’s able but likely get stuck because of a programming flaw. If it becomes lodged/wedged under furniture but the spring tension bumper isn’t depressed in the process, it performs the most wimpy attempt at freeing itself only to give up seconds later and alert with a dithering audible beep that rarely alerts because of its low tone, one that conjures a feeling of disappointment more so than distress. The remote is your only connection (when not physically searching and dislodging the robot from its usual stopping points) so set yourself up for success and tie this thing to a fixed, centralized object in your home because you’re gonna misplace it. Because this robot does not connect via an app you program it’s schedule and mode with a RF remote akin to the one you use for your tv. This is also how you tell it to stop or return home when you’re simply tired of it getting stuck under your couch for literally the fourth time today. Lastly, and just to put an end to this because even I’ve already grown tired of this review, it won’t clean the “perimeter” of an area unless you find that lost remote and actually prompt it to. What? Yes, you know the toe kicks of you kitchen cabinets or the floor area adjacent to your walls? Yeah it avoids all of that be employing a infrared or Doppler type sensor for redirection instead of maybe bumping into something. Too bad this sensors feature isn’t programmed into its obstruction and obstacle avoidance to aid in not getting it itself stuck under the couch, tv stand or backside of the recliner...seems an obvious place to make use of it but what do I know? Well I know this, if you’ve read this far you probably already know that I’m not a big fan of this vacuum. Our house has harbored two others (iRobot) and both were louder, apparently more capable of terrain and avoiding obstacles, and also more expensive. If this one had the little “beacon device” that kept it contained in a space or away from another space then I believe that would be a major improvement. Without the beacon it simply gets stuck where it could be avoided and that is enough to lower its overall rating for all of us in our home.","Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2021"

B07R295MLS,3,Not as good as Roomba,"I got this vacuum to replace our roomba (it’s lasted for years; just wanted to try a new one). This one seems “dumber” than the Roomba. It will get stuck on the edge of a rug and just sit there and spin until the battery dies. The Roomba would stop and beep to alert you that it was stuck. This vacuum also gets tangled in cords something fierce. I know you are supposed to pick them up, but it found a lamp cord under a bed and spun itself (the wheels and the brushes) around the cord until the battery died. That was fun to untangle… One positive is that it is more gentle than the Roomba that we have. It will stop short of banging into most things and typically only lightly tap them. So if you’re concerned about baseboard or chair leg scuffs, this is a good option. It’s also very quiet, which is nice. The sucking power seems good and it picks up a lot of dust. However, we set it down in front of a broken chip and it spun and flung pieces of the chip around while only vacuuming up like 30% of the chip. I ended up using a dust pan. One thing I don’t like is that you can only program it to run one time of day and it runs that time every day. I’d like to have to ability to select which days I want it to run. Unfortunately, it’s all or nothing. Also, something happened at one point where, even though the time was set correctly, it began running in the middle of the night ( I have it set for 8am). I tried reprogramming it and it continued. Eventually, we unplugged it, turned it off, removed the batteries from the remote and started all over. After googling the “phantom run time” of Eufy, that is what other users suggested. That seemed to work- for now. Overall not too bad for the price, but definitely not the smartest machine. We affectionately call her Rosie and frequent tell her she’s she’s not very bright. It’ll get up most of the visible dirt so I’m ok with her shortcomings.","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2023"
B07R295MLS,3,Medium pile carpet = great! Low pile carpet = not so great. Company = AMAZING!!,"UPDATE 2/2020: Well, after about 19 months, our eufy has decided to stop working properly. It keeps spinning and spinning on one wheel, then beeps until we come rescue it. After closer look, some of the wiring has rubbed through and shorts out the left side. We've had a nice sweeper for that time (it sucks up a lot of dirt!), but I'm disappointed that we'll have to find a replacement already. I guess I expected it to last longer! Original review: I wanted to love this. It's just ok. We have both medium pile and low pile carpets. This vacuum works great on the medium pile (surprisingly!!), but in the low pile areas, I just watch it brush away the dirt or roll right over it, leaving the room just as dirty. You'd think it would be the opposite and work great on the smooth floor. Not so much. This is disappointing because we wanted the vacuum mainly for that area of our home, and we chose this model because we thought it would work well in the whole house instead of just that part. I guess I'm just left wanting more from it. UPDATE: I have changed my original rating of 2 stars to 4 stars. This company reached out to me and gave me different suggestions of things to try in order to meet our needs. They are amazing to work with!! Although it still doesn't work quite as well on the low pile areas as we'd like, we are in much better shape now that we've been conversing with the company. A++++++ customer service!!!!","Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2018"

B07R295MLS,3,eufy Boost IQ RoboVac 11S,"eufy Boost IQ RoboVac 11S (Slim), 1300Pa Strong Suction, Super Quiet, Self-Charging Robotic Vacuum Cleaner, Cleans Hard Floors to Medium-Pile Carpets (Black) It runs for about 90 minutes. It needs to be charged for about 6 hours. In the beginning, I was (a bit) awestruck: (at its behavior and at the amount of dirt it collected, on EVERY run!) Where does all that dust, dirt & tiny sand-like grains come from ?! Early on, it would touch an impediment and go off in some other direction (good); then, it seemed to stop 4-6"" from an object and go off (not so good: why the uncleaned space? Esp near walls.) You DO have to ""robo-proof"" your house or it will likely get stuck (neutral, surely all robo-vacs require this.) It often does not go under the thing sometimes called a Bed skirt, dust ruffle, or valence, or a similar thing we sometimes find around sofas & beds. This morning alone, it fell down the steps (only two of them) twice (bad). It does this about 40-50% of the time now. ============================= Feb 27, 2019 The folks at Eufy were kind enough to respond to my review. --Even though it was mostly positive! I liked, and still do, the mere presence of my robo-vac. The house must be vastly more dust-free than before. Eufy not only responded, but offered to replace the 11S with a new Eufy 30. I got it, set it up, and have had it a few days now. It cleans as well as the 11S, but, it --seems-- a little bit louder, but it is hard to know precisely. I used my phone's sound meter and holding it a few inches above the vac, found it to be about 57dB. Perhaps others with both of those models can do the same and we can compare. It includes 2 lengths of strips that block the vac from crossing. It is a bit of a danger at the top of the steps, but it does keep it from falling. I'll keep monitoring. ===================================================== April 7, 2019... The RoboVac 30 cleans as well as the 11s and, it also -seems- to function better at the edge of the carpeted stairs. I no longer use the magnetic strip to keep it from falling. (The 11c seemed to be good in the beginning regarding the tendency to fall, but seemed to get worse.) So, we'll see, but so far, so good. The magnetic tape IS a whole lot better than the boards or shoes I had to deploy to keep the RoboVac out of certain areas. Eufy reps pointed out that the RoboVac 30 is a little louder, since the max suction of RoboVac 30 is 1500PA (11S 1300PA). The stronger the suction is, the louder the noise is. I normally have both of the Vacs simply on Boost IQ. The only time I knew it to be on Max suction, was when it was in 'edge' cleaning mode. The RoboVac 30 also seems better in that it doesn't stop six+- inches from walls or obstructions, but rather goes right to the obstruction, then does its change of direction. That makes it less necessary to do an 'edge' cleaning manually. Another time saver!","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2019"
B07R295MLS,3,Not up to par,"I was looking for a dumb robot vacuum. (If I had the time to set it up with WiFi and mapping rooms and whatnot I would rather spend that with vacuuming: it’s healthier and gets the room cleaner) This is dumb enough, but actually a bit too much. Gets stuck everywhere, even on the edge of steps where no vacuum ever got stuck. Also, the robot and the charger have very bright light so can’t use it in the bedroom. On the plus side it is low profile so fits under furniture and also unafraid of black carpet that stops more intelligent robots. We will keep it for the latter purpose. Yet more on the negative: it is not very resilient (cleans for less than an hour) and not thorough in its cleaning (when compared to nearly decade old alternatives). You can probably find better ones.","Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2024"

B07R295MLS,3,"Broken within 6 months after daily use on hardwood floors! *Update - May, 8 2019","I'm so disappointed in this vacuum We bought the eufy 11s in July of 2018, It is now February 2019. We bought this item because we live in a rural area, the dirt and dust in our home is excessive. To save ourselves the duty of sweeping the debris off our hardwood floors every day, we decided to make this purchase. It worked great for the first 6 months, kept everything clean and clear. No dirt sticking to my bare feet when walking around the house! AMAZING! The last two months have not been so good. The vacuum runs every morning, but dosen't pickup the dirt anymore. IT IS AS IF IT HAS NOT VACUUMED THE FLOOR AT ALL! I have watched all the you tube videos and referred to the owners manual and have done all the maintenance i can find (replacing filters, hepa filters, front sweepers, cleaned sensors, cleaned the front wheel), but the VACUUM JUST DOES NOT WORK. It has suction when it is on but does not pick anything up. Today I looked at the removable brush (drive contact point), all looked fine. But when looking at the contact point on the vacuum, THE PLASTIC CONTACT POINT IS COMPLETELY STRIPPED. Therefore even though the vacuum runs, the brush does not turn, and does not sweep debris into the collection container. Please see the picture, this socket should be square but has been reamed so bad it is round. From daily use on hardwood floors........ I would caution anyone from buying this unit. IT IS VERY CHEAPLY BUILT IN THE AREAS THAT MATTER MOST! Unless you have 200 - 300 bucks every 6 months to replace it. I know I don't. *******Update 5-8-2019******** I upgraded the star rating (from one star) because of the Eufy customer service team! To my great surprise I was contacted by the Eufy team with an offer to trade out my broken unit for a new replacement? YES! I could not believe it at first. A COMPANY THAT SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, AND PRODUCT QUALITY! I have recently found that the 11s has a 12 month hassle free warranty. I was under the impression from the printed material (included with the vacuum) that the 11s only had a 30 day warranty. The Eufy team went out of their way to honor the 12 month warranty for me. VERY HASSLE FREE! I received a replacement item with in 4 days of responding to their email through the Amazon message system. I also returned the broken unit for inspection, so they can hopefully upgrade future versions. The new unit works just as well as the first one. The house looks much better, and once again no debris sticking to my bare feet in the mornings! I AM SO HAPPY! I will hopefully find a way to avoid the last failure by fining a way to do some preventative maintenance? I am not sure on that right now, but I will update as this as I find any solutions. This is a great vacuum and a GENUINE GOOD COMPANY TO DO BUSINESS WITH.

B07R295MLS,3,(Update) Like a Tesla ... Made of cheap plastic,"Play Video -See below for update- I really like the robovac concept, and this one in particular does a really great job. Sleek, smart and powerful... *Almost* like a Tesla in vacuum form. But I'm not a fan at all in the fact that it's made of parts that ruin so easily. (Manufacturers in all industries do this to secure ongoing revenue. Look up planned obsolescence). Most parts seem sound but at an average rate the brushes need to get replaced in a little over once a month. It's pretty clear that they're making a killing selling marked up replacement parts. Either make quality parts in the first place or don't name us pay 15% of the unit every time we need a stupid brush. Hope eufy stops cheapening their brand and ends this practice. They have the potential to be Tesla but are more like a made-to-break Range Rover *Eufy reached out immediately after this review was posted. They offered to send out a bunch of new brushes and bristles- I didn't say yes or no but the gesture was appreciated. For consumers' sake I told them I would not change the critical part of my review (it should be noted they didn't ask me to). Same process has happened over and over again with so many manufacturers- it's easier to over-satisfy and quiet one upset customer rather than correcting the actual issue, letting thousands more face the same problem. **Please mark that this was useful to send the message that consumers won't tolerate this anymore.","Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2018"
B07R295MLS,3,"I really wanted to like this, but...","To preface this review, I always read lots of reviews before purchasing higher priced items so I'm not jumping into something blindly. In that sense I guess the vacuum lived up to its decent reviews but it definitely fell short in several areas. After recently getting two new puppies I decided to try out another robot vac to avoid manually Swiffering the floor every other day. The Eufy had good reviews compared to others and the price pointy was acceptable. I'll start out with the pro's for the device, then move on to the con's. Pro's: great suction great sidewall cleanup thorough mapping of the area meant nothing was missed price point noise - it's pretty quiet cleaning out the bin was simple Con's: The detachable brushes pop off ALL THE TIME! Did I mention that the brushes come off constantly? it easily gets stuck on kitchen mats and even very low pile rugs/carpets While you can see that the pro's outnumber the con's, that main con item was a deal breaker for me. The two spinning brushes literally popped off every time the robot ran, and this is on my wood floors with just a thin mat by the front door. This required me to stop what I was doing, locate the brush(es) and pop them back on so that cleaning could continue. Several times they would pop off and I couldn't find them for hours or even days. Obviously this detracted from the whole purpose of having a robovac. While I understand the design thought for the brushes to be detachable, in practice it does not work so well. I ended up using this for about two weeks before I finally had enough and returned it. For now I'm back to manually sweeping until I can find a better solution. :( the roller and brushes require constant cleaning to remove hair and debris.","Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2023"
B07R295MLS,3,Eh. It's ok-ish,"I waited almost a year to write my review because I think it takes time to know if an appliance is worth it. This vacuum does pretty good at picking up the daily bits of crumbs and dirt that get on the floor. I did find dog hair in the canister so it picks that up too but not like a regular vacuum with a brush roll. This is not a smart vacuum so it just bumps around from room to room randomly. I knew that when I bought it and I will say it has a nice long battery life so if you can just let it go it will eventually get a whole room clean. The only issue there is you have to be anal about every cord picked up, no shoelaces or loose rug threads because it will suck them up and then you'll get an error code or wrecked cord. I think I spent almost as much time following the vacuum around to make sure it wasn't getting into trouble as I would have just cleaning the floor myself. The less complicated your room and floor, the better this thing will perform. My only real issue is that I keep having issues with a ""bumper stuck"" error code. When this happens the machine gets trapped rolling backwards in a 360 degree pattern until it stops and beeps. I've taken the thing apart and put it back together and sometimes that works. Sometimes tapping the bumpers frees them, sometimes it doesn't. The weirdest thing is that the bumpers aren't stuck, they move freely so there's nothing physical I can find to fix, which makes it more frustrating. If it's a sensor or computer issue, I can't do anything about that. I've probably only used it about a dozen times because of that issue and haven't used it at all in the last 3 to 4 months. It's not the worst vacuum in the world, but I wouldn't buy it again.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2022"
B07R295MLS,3,IT'S JUST OK - Here are the answers to the most important questions:,"I had several questions when I got this yesterday, so here are the answers: Does this connect to an app or cell phone?: No. Does it have the ability using the remote control to confine itself to one room or just the entryway where all the dirt tracks in?: No. Does it have the ability to schedule itself to clean at night?: Yes. Doe it have the ability to schedule itself to travel to the specific area that I want cleaned at night and clean that?: - No. Does it get stuck and stop and require attention a lot?: Yes. Enough to be pointless?: No. Since there's no app... When it STOPS is there a readout on the remote control that tells me what went wrong?: No. Is there a readout on the vacuum that tells me what went wrong?: No. How do I find out what went wrong?: BEEPS. When it stops it beeps repeatedly like morse code. It beeps 4 times in rapid succession to say ""my main brush is stuck""... then it pauses for 1 second, and beeps four times in rapid succession again. - There are different beep pulses for different problems. You have to learn to speak robot. What are the worst dangers?: Cables and wires. They stop it reliably. If it encounters an odd obstacle, it just gives up and leaves that area uncleaned, right?: No. It commits the entirety of its ridiculous little existence to DYING ON THAT HILL and keeps fighting the entryway to your cat's liter box or the base of your microphone stand in pointless little 2 inch circles until it goes into kernel panic and sounds an alarm. IF I BUY THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONE WILL THE FLOOR MAPPING IN THE APP ENABLE IT TO ACTUALLY GO CLEAN THE SPECIFIC AREA THAT I WANT CLEANED EACH NIGHT AT 3AM?: I have no idea.

B07R295MLS,3,Great - but doesn't last long,"Eufy is great. We have dogs. Eufy picks up the hair and dirt. Very well. So well that I have to clean out the vacuum filters and remove the scrubbing brush to get out the hair each and every time I run the Eufy vacuum - which is daily. Nasty job but at least Eufy gets up all the dirt and hair and helps keep my hard wood floors clean. The problem is that Eufy has to be replaced about once a year. Why? Cheap parts. This replacement comes about because of the connection for the rotating brush to the vacuum. Dirt gets everywhere. The interconnection of the rotating brush to it's mate on the vacuum is plastic. Dirt is abrasive. The dirt gets lodged in to this connection and takes the mate of the two square parts and rounded them off so that the rotating brush would no longer turn. Eufy maker: Please spend a few more bucks and use metal parts where they are critical. This is my second Eufy in two years. If you don't have dogs - or ladies in the house with long hair - Eufy is great. Oh yeah - long hair gets wrapped around the brush and it's a pain to remove. But not so bad when you have beautiful daughters with beautiful long hair. But if you, your kids, and your dogs/cats don't have hair - you're golden. And dryer sheets.....Eufy loves (read hates) dryer sheets. Dryer sheets get wrapped around the wheels and run up inside of Eufy where you can't get to them without taking apart Eufy. Unfortunately putting Eufy back together again once you've taken it apart is really tough. So as long as there is no hair or dryer sheets in your house - you're golden. If only Eufy was made and engineered as well as my stand up handled vacuum where this things aren't a problem then I'd be a happy happy man. Oh well.","Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2021"

B07R295MLS,3,"Gets stuck a lot, very punchable","Function: We were always amazed at how much dirt we emptied daily and really miss the clean floors now that he's passed. It's super frustrating when it gets stuck or eats your expensive ear buds. It worked every day, but its patterns seemed totally random and would always return to the scene of the stuck crime as soon as he was removed. Ours kept getting stuck on a coffee table leg which runs parallel to the ground. We often come home from walking in morning and notice he's not in his charger and go on a ""bob hunt"" which is like hide and go seek but the end result is finding the thing you forgot to take off the floor and removing it from his hungry jaws hoping it wasn't destroyed. He's hungry for shirts, power cords to your modem, headphones, phone chargers, and he loooooves macbook cables. He'll spend an hour humping the brick to your fireplace before the battery dies and you have to repaint the grind marks. I even 3d printed a bumper for him but it didn't let that stop his hunger for humping. Durability: It's ok, the brushes will get tangled and you'll need to keep track and trim them so they don't get worse. If he gets stuck, and starts sanding down the walnut legs on your thousand dollar coffee table, and you punch it, the top is made of glass. Now you have glass everywhere and no vacuum to clean up the tiny shards of glass. Punchability: Very high. Edit:. The product still stays at 3 stars but the company is 5. Their customer service is amazing and really took the time to try to fix my problem, even though it really couldn't be. I ended up buying a vacuum that has laser mapping and it never gets stuck and avoids humping my coffee table.

B07R295MLS,3,"Quiet, update","After less than a year of use the quiet has gone away, getting some noise from the gears that drive the side brushes. The relative quiet of this vacuum was one of the main reasons for selecting this model. It’s run time has already begun to degrade, I’m sure a battery replacement will fix that. The suction seems to have decreased some as well. Not sure if a battery will fix that or not. I plan to replace the drive gears for the side brush’s and upgrade the battery and see how that goes. In any case, it’s a decent vac, but after less than a year of use and already suffering gear noise and battery degradation, I would not recommend this vac any longer. Nor am I likely to replace it with any similar models when the time comes to replace it. I had another robot vac that worked very well, but wanted one that was quieter. This one works as well or better, and is quiet for a vacuum. It does have 3 suction levels and does get close to as loud as the older one on the highest setting, but on the lowest, it works fine on laminate floors, and is quiet enough to run while watching tv in the same room. We have 2 cats, so plenty of hair and some litter to pick up, it does great for that. Have had no problems with it yet, filters and brushes seem to last long, easy to empty the bin, has a good run time even on the high setting. Not a smart vac, just bounces around until it covers everywhere or needs recharged. On the low setting, it covers around 1400 sq ft pretty well, that’s enough to get most of our house each charge. I would recommend this one for a good value for the money robot vac.","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2022"
B07R295MLS,3,It's a Teenager...,"It's kind of like an immature teenager: slim, quieter than some, unpredictable, and you can't tell it what to do. It accomplishes the task and misses some spots. It lives up to its product description. I received exactly what I intentionally ordered: an unsmart, autonomous vaccuum, that wasn't programmable, and doesn't memorize the floor plan, and not blue tooth enabled. And, that is what I received. Where I give it 3 stars vs 5: 1. It does miss cleaning some spots (especially near its docking base). 2. It doesn't tell me when it's full. 3. Hair gets wound around the wheels and brush, but doesn't tell me something stopped working or moving. Notes (performs as described, but you need to prepare for the cleaning): It doesn't seem to ""see"" things and avoid them 1. When I forget to pick up my computer cord, and it drags the laptop off the desk 2. Or bumps into the tray table and spills my coffee 3. Make sure you empty it after each use, because it will still ""go through the motions"", but when full, you will see it can't store your dirt and leaves it on the floor. Previously I had a Shark robot, that was programmable, I didn't think it was necessary to replace it with a programmable robot, that was hundreds more expensive. Because the Shark, didn't see the dog poop, thus tracked right through it and did circles on my floor, grinding it into the carpet, and smearing it all into its wheels, and suction components- it was so covered in poopage that it was worth it to me, to toss the NEW Shark, and buy Eufy.","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2022"
B07R295MLS,3,Worked great when it worked! (And it’s working again!),"Another update 5/14/2021: Now one of the side brush motors has gone out. They are available online for less than $20, tutorial videos are also available online. However, this is only 22 months old, and it’s frustrating to have to make these repairs. I’m hoping to get another year’s use out of it, so the money will be well spent, as I figure it has cost $10/month to run so far. If you are not handy with tools, this is the point where you cut your losses and throw it in the trash. Update: we were able to find a replacement wheel with motor online for about $25, and so my vacuum is still going. It still will not consistently start each day. We set it, and all is well for awhile, then it either doesn’t self start at all, or decides to vacuum in the middle of the night. Our other Eufy works just fine. This year will be two years since we got them (May and July), and I’m hoping they run for another two years. When I consider that the Hoover I bought in 1976 ran for 30+ years, and my Dyson ran (well) for over 10 years, these don’t have much of life span. All that said, I’d still buy them again. It’s the closest I will get to having a maid! I have had my main floor Eufy 16 months. Liked it so well that I bought a second one for our finished basement. I am always amazed at the amount of dust and debris it finds in my house. For the last six months, I’ve had to start it manually every day - it occasionally turns itself on at odd times...like 4:00 a.m., but usually I have to start it. This week, he would back out of his charger, spin in a circle, and re-dock. I cleaned him completely, but same result. My husband thinks the motor is bad in the right wheel. I checked to see how old he was, and was shocked to learn we just got him last year. That means he cost about $14/month to run, not counting electricity. Cheaper than a maid, but for over $200, it should run at least a couple years.","Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2020"

B07R295MLS,3,Falls down stairs,"I bought this robovac exclusively to clean the carpeted upstairs of my house. I have had 2 Eufy brand robovacs. The first simply wore out but did an excellent job for a first-generation robovac. The second one I got (G30) is simply great. My home has 4 levels, so One level gets swept at night and I move it to one of the other levels during the day so it will have a chance to re-charge during the day. On Cyber Monday I decided to buy this Robovac exclusively for the only carpeted level of the house. While it has GREAT suction and does an excellent job it does have a few drawbacks. This one does not connect to the internet (which my G30 does). It vacuums in a random path rather than in straight lines (as long as the carpet gets cleaned, who cares). But the biggest drawback is the fact that it does not seem to have a drop sensor. Consequently, if I do not block the stairway, it tries to commit suicide.

B07R295MLS,3,Not good for pet households.,"My iLive vacuum died after many years of heavy use, and instead of buying the same brand, I decided to try this one as the reviews were so good. Bad decision. I have two dogs and a cat, and this vacuum regularly jams up requiring me to have to disassemble and clean it. It also takes four times as long to charge as it spends vacuuming. I’ve only had it since April and I can’t wait to replace it. Updated: The company read my review and gave me a full refund, for which I am appreciative!","Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2024"
B07R295MLS,3,Neutral. Not for Heavy Duty cleaning,"I bought this with the idea I could let it run and I wouldn't have to sweep every single day. It didn't come with instructions, which I thought was weird, but was easy enough to figure out without them. First run through the upper level (all vinyl plank) it did ok. I understand it's a robot and it's trying to figure out the house layout, but within the first five minutes it threw itself down the stairs - twice. Second run a few days later, I remedied the steps issue by putting chairs in the way. It did ok with the area rug we put down, but the little brushes would sometimes come off. Noticed the robot did not want to get close to the walls, and would leave a six inch distance between itself and the wall. Not super excited about this. Third run, it resolved the steps issue and hasn't tried violence any more. It still has an issue with the space between the wall. I was also expecting it to do better with getting under the bedroom furniture, which it gets under, but we have a couple of dogs and their hair likes to tumbleweed under there. At least it pushed the hair out? Over all I am pretty neutral on this robot. It served it's purpose, as I wanted to see if I would like a robot. I think a more expensive robot would do a better job.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2023"
B07R295MLS,3,Not as good as I thought,"I bought my first robovac in 2018 after 3 years I had to change the battery pack, 2 years after the front wheel broke so in 2023 I bought the same model to replace it. One year and one month after the vacuum started malfunctioning, look like the battery started dying. Of course I am out of warranty and I understand that but it is very disappointing to see the quality of a product ,who overall do a good job , going down like that.","Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2024"
B07R295MLS,3,Review after 9 months,"For reference: this is my first robot vacuum, so I don't know how it compares. I run it on low pile carpet about 1x/week . My regular vacuum is a V8 Dyson cordless. Family of 2 adults and a toddler; no pets. Hair, crumbs, dust...but not really a heavy load. Pros: -Slim and fits under furniture easily, even a very low bed frame. I love this. -Pretty effective. Definitely keeps the house clean between ""real"" vacuums, works well on edges. -The cannister generally lasts 2 vacuums before I have to empty. Not bad. Cons, especially after 9 months of use: -After 9 months, the battery doesn't last to clean my ~600 sq ft upstairs. Seems very inefficient and takes at least 2 hours. My husband hates the sound (quiet, but whiny) and my toddler is scared of it; I'd run it more if I didn't have to avoid them, but basically it means my whole floor doesn't always get clean. -Even when the battery lasted the whole cleaning, my Dyson is far better. Period. Will pick up at least a quarter cannister more, especially of fine dust, right after I've run the Eufy. Eufy is more successful on my hardwood floors. -After 9 months, the closure on the cannister is broken. So, when emptying, I have to carefully remove and keep it sandwiched together to go empty it. Not a big deal, but I'd expect better after <1 year.","Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2023"
B07R295MLS,3,Mixed changes from old model,"We had an older model Eufy which was losing battery power and was eventually destroyed trying to remove a headset wire it wound around the wheels. We bought a newer model and I have mixed feelings about it. The good: it's lower to the ground and can successfully go under the sofa without getting stuck - in fact, it seems to get stuck less overall, which is nice. What's not nice: the old model had three brushes - this one has only 1 - and did a better job cleaning. The old one also came with replacement filter and brushes, which this one did not. The new one has a smaller dust container, which means more emptying. Overall, I'm glad to have this to pick up some of the dust and dog hair, but wish it did as good a cleaning job as the old one.","Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2024"
B07R295MLS,3,You get what you pay for,"I have used an iRobot Roomba 700 series for the last 7 years. Recently the Roomba battery died so I ordered a new battery off amazon and was surprised that they were on backorder with an estimated delivery date 2 months out. Since we own a multilevel house it made sense at this point to buy another robo vac. So I bought the Eufy as it was much less expensive than most robo vacs and it came with great reviews. On the positive side it was easy to set up and run. It is smaller and thinner than the Roomba. The price is roughly 1/2 or less than the upper end robo vacs. It is slick looking and cleans small rooms and spaces adequately well. When done it returns to its base and it also returns to its base when running out of charge. It may be quieter than the Roomba but I am rarely at home when running the vac so frankly I don’t care how loud it is. On the downside the battery life is short and large rooms and spaces are a problem. The largest space it has succefully vacuumed at our house has been 540 square feet. Larger spaces than that and it runs out of steam and returns to its base leaving some spaces 1/2 done. The Roomba on the other hand manages to clean every space we have without running out of charge. The Eufy does not like cords or any other objects on the floor. The Roomba doesn’t seem to care as much about cords and has only been stuck on a small number of occasions. The Roomba cleans more thoroughly than the Eufy, the Roomba leaves no debris on the floor after it is done. The Eufy is as easy to clean as the Roomba but neither is cleaned out without some effort. The Roomba is a tank and very durable, so far no complaints about durability with the Eufy. After a couple of months the replacement battery for the Roomba arrived and that old machine is running as good as when we bought it. At twice the cost the Roomba is better than the Eufy, but at our house The Eufy is a nice vac to use on smaller spaces. So the Eufy is fine as a secondary robo vac and would be ideal for apartments, condos and houses with smaller spaces.","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2018"
B07R295MLS,3,Rolling brush noise,"UPDATE: Just wanted to give Eufy customer service 5 star. They responded to the review I posted instantly and reached out to me to help resolve the issue. It is a great product. Noise level is outstanding comparing to other products that I’ve owned. Suction is great. I have four dogs that shed quite a bit and this vacuum kept my floor decently clean (vacuuming twice a day). However, after exactly a month using it, it starts making weird noises, even after the equipment is cleaned throughout to remove any debris. Troubleshooting using the support webpage found that the rolling brush is causing the issue. It appears that the ends had worn out. This equipment is only a month old and its part already worn out? Unfortunately, it is now past the return time frame from Amazon. It would be nice if the equipment comes with a replacement rolling brush if it could be damage that soon.","Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2024"

B07R295MLS,3,Not too smart,"This little fellow gets stuck constantly. Sometimes it can’t find its way out of a room and will clean the room its in constantly. It most certainly can’t find its way back to the base, so when it runs out of battery I have to go looking for it. I’ve tried the base in several places and still no luck. It has no method to its madness so 100 minutes doesn’t clean the 1,200 square feet of the downstairs of my house. I’d be happy with two rooms. I contacted service and the tech support guy acted like he had no idea what to say. He said maybe try turning on some lights. My house is a basic colonial so nothing unusual about it. After all these great reviews I thought this was capable of much more. It does clean well. Still debating on whether to send it back. Maybe I just got a defective one. But this is more trouble than it’s worth at this point. And I most certainly can’t run it if I’m not home because it gets stuck so much.","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024"

B07R295MLS,3,Great for a college student,"First off I will say that I’m a college age guy who doesn’t like to vacuum all that often. I saved up and bought Eufy 11s for a loved one for an early Christmas before heading home for the holidays and so a LOT was riding on this product performing well right out of the box - money is tight this year. I’ve got to say that this was well worth the money. It needs to be charged right out of the box but it charges so quickly that the excitement of using it did not wear off by the time it was ready to go. The remote control has a ton of cool features like spot cleaning and edge cleaning to maximize its adaptability to your homes “dirt patterns”. I opened the dust bin every 10 minutes or so just to see how much it was actually getting and damn it was a lot! Like I said before I’m a college age guy who doesn’t enjoy cleaning so now I’m definitely considering saving up to buy another one for myself. This vacuum is great for all kinds of people. If your parents are reaching an older age and have a harder time keeping the home clean like they used to, or if you’re tired of vacuuming every day, or even if you’re just looking for a little companionship. It’s quiet enough to let it do it’s thing but powerful enough to get the job done right. I suspect that a lot of people with negative reviews have cluttered houses or defective models because it says everything it says it does, and does it well. It’s certainly a quality product. My only complaint is that it tends to throw up sometimes and leave dust that should have been sucked up by it in its trail - not sure what’s going on there. It also tends to lose its dust collectors (the brushes on the sides) sometimes when transferring between hardwood and carpet even when they’re fully pushed down. While I have no regrets about the purchase I’m hoping to see the Eufy robovac resolve the vomiting issue before I start encouraging my friends and family to buy one. Bottom line is that this is a great product that makes a perfect gift for anyone from college guys to the elderly.","Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2018"
B07R295MLS,3,"Good for day to day cleaning, however, not on carpet.","I’d like to start out by saying that this vacuum has saved us with keeping up with 2 dogs worth of dog hair. I was vacuuming every other day and by running this vacuum each day, sometimes twice a day has been a huge help! With that being said, I do not think it does much of anything on our carpet besides make weird haphazard track lines. I usually just shut the bedrooms doors while it runs and then vacuum them myself. Anyway, it does great on our vinyl floor and the linoleum in our bathroom. I do pick up the bathroom rugs each time it runs as well because it has a hard time maneuvering over them and leaves tuffs of hair. Another thing I want to address is the fact that it was so quiet for the first two months, and now it is pretty loud. I attached a video showing how loud it gets when I try to turn it to high. When the video first starts, that is on standard. It used to just be a soft hum and it’s pretty loud now. I clean it out after each use and deep clean the brushes & filters every week to keep up with hair and such. I’m not sure what changed to make it run so loud now. I’m going to keep using this vacuum as long as I can. It works great for every day to keep up with every day messes. I still vacuum myself weekly but I use this for every day. I will not, however, purchase another one once this one dies. I am appreciative for what it is as of right now but I will probably move on to something different when it needs replaced.

B07R295MLS,3,You'll need to name it!,"Ours is named Mabel. We send her around our apartment about twice a week, always supervised. She has problems - cords for the electric blanket were initially an issue, but I've secured those to the bed frame. She also tends to get stuck under stuff that's not quite high enough for her to clear. Mabel gets stuck under the door of our refrigerator (just the wrong height) and our coffee table (ditto). I start her out on 'Edge Clean' mode, and she follows the edges around all the rooms - if she doesn't come back in 10 minutes, I go look for her. After a full circuit of edge cleaning, I set her off in random mode - she just wanders around doing her thing. After another half hour, I'll send her home (might need directional help) for a recharge. Every time, I'm surprised the amount of stuff she picks up. Cleanup after vacuuming is easy. Catch bucket is easy to empty, filter wipes off nicely, and the roller brush cleans up well. Haven't had it that long, but wear parts seem easy to replace. edit: After months of service, no real changes from the initial review. There's still stuff she doesn't get over and needs help, and stuff she gets stuck under (but we're reducing those). Original brushes are still going fine. We're now down to one cat, so expected less pickup - but NO. We have a small place (800 sf) but Mabel still manages to fill her bin pretty well running her twice a week. I've managed to resist asking eufy if there's an oven cleaning attachment. edit: After two years of service, operation became erratic - the unit would fail to turn on. Some bumping and thumping might get it going again. After fighting with it for a month, I gave up and did an autopsy taking the machine apart to the point I could see the circuit board and its connections. A couple of the plug connectors impressed me as being insecure (based on my radio control experience with boats and aircraft).

B07R295MLS,3,Read before you buy!,"1. One can pre-set the cleaning time but there is no date option! So if you set vacuuming time it will vacuum every day at that hour. Not that you could allow it to work without supervision anyways. 2. It gets caught on every wire! I nailed down the wires that must go across the floor so it would stop getting stuck on them and spin until it runs out of battery. 3. It humps my floor lamp every time until the battery runs out. 4. ""Single room cleaning"" - This function is a misnomer, this is truly a 30-minute time-limited cleaning. You cannot teach it the borders of a room, you have to close the door on it to limit it to a space for 30 minutes of vacuuming. So if you have an open floor plan you cannot limit it to the kitchen only for example. 5. ""Go home"" function makes it wander around the house at low speed FOREVER until it runs out of battery. (Unlike Roomba that finds its way back straightaway) 6. While the Roomba has a pattern of cleaning this on is truly just randomly bouncing off of things - so when I start in the kitchen (in hope to clean the kitchen) it won't go up and down in a pattern, no, it will bounce off sthing and head right into the living room.

B07R295MLS,3,Its perks are actually its biggest flaws,"This is my second robovac. The first is a Roomba 690, which is a bit outdated compared to current offerings but I'm going to compare these two because even compared to this older Roomba, this Eufy vac leaves a lot to be desired. The good: -It is quiet. Not so quiet that you don't know it's running but you can have a phone call without too much distraction if it's running. -The remote guided navigation is handy when you want to move it to another room on the same floor without picking it up. -The sensor does a good job of preventing it from bumping into walls and objects...usually. -The price makes it an attractive choice when comparing vacuums. The bad: -The low profile is actually a negative. It is short enough to go under a lot of furniture but it's also short enough that it just barely goes under couches. This sounds like it would be good but the reality is the bottom of couches are not flat and once it becomes wedged in a low spot beneath the couch it cannot free itself. You have to block off the bottom of the couch to prevent the vacuum from getting stuck every night or move the couch to find your vacuum if it happens to get wedged in the back near the wall. I have a 10x10 foot custom L-shaped couch so this gets old really fast because the couch weighs a ton. -Programming requires the remote and is no option for different times on different days. If you have small kids, you had better hide the remote before they do. -It doesn't hold much, especially when it's picking up dog hair. The Roomba has a wide open canister intake that prevents clogging. When this becomes full, the very narrow opening clogs quickly and hair gets bound up in the brushes. There is no way it would hold enough to clean up the mess demonstrated in the demo video. In summary: This is an average device that will work well if you have time to babysit it or don't mind vacuum-proofing your house to prevent it from getting stuck or lost. If you can afford to spend more, get the Roomba.","Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2018"

B07R295MLS,3,"Eh, spend a little more to get something better","I guess, in comparison to some higher end vacuums on the market, you get what you pay for. The absolute biggest drawback is that it has no memory. It just seems to clean randomly, bumping into wall after wall, often times going over the same areas multiple times before covering the whole floor and going back to charge, regardless of what setting its on. It would probably have a much better cleaning effeciency and could cover more space in less time if it remembered where it was going and where its been. It also gets stuck in the sames spots over and over either behind my couch or under my, which again could be avoided with memory. Other than that, the only other con is the fact that the front wheel gets tangled with dusty hair and there's no way to access the cavity to clean it. Although, for the most part, just about every other piece is serviceable. I like the tool it came with the clean the brush. I even use it on my regular vacuum. I do wish it was a tab bit lower. It almost makes it uner my tv stand and bookshelf but not quite. Had it been low enough to do so, i'd imagine it would also help keep it from getting stuck under other furniture. But I think this is the lowest robo vacuum you'll find. Not sure how well it works on carpet but it does keep my hardwood floors clean. With 3 cats and a dog, it saves me the headache of keeping up with all the hair and litter on the floor (now if it could obly do my couch lol) the charging base is super light. So, sometimes itll manage to turn out of place and the vacuum will have trouble lining up and placing itself on the charger. All in all, I guess you get what you pay for. But if you're willing to spend a little more, I'd recommend getting a ""smarter"" vacuum and save yourself some frustrations. Edit: Nearly a year later and one of the spinning side sweepers has stopped working. It sounds like some teeth on the inside have worn out and just kinda grind their way through. Itll still kinda spin but it doesnt take much for it to stop... Was really hoping this would last longer than a year.

But, now it has decided to turn itself on at 5am, wake everyone up, and start cleaning. It has done this two nights in a row, so I guess I’ll have to power it down and unplug it if we plan to get a full nights sleep. I had high hopes, but realistically I can vacuum/swiffer my floors much quicker on my own than the process of using this Eufy. Pros-good suction and does clean well.

B07R295MLS,3,Quiet but has some flaws compared to Roomba,"I have an IRobot 620 that is now ten years old or so, and still going strong. However I decided to change to a newer and quieter machine - the noise of the Roomba being its only drawback. After using the eufy for a week or so, I returned it, for these reasons: 1) It gets tangled up in rugs, cables anything loose of the floor and is then a problem to disentangle because the brushes tie themselves up in whatever was in the way. eufy are clearly aware of this problem because they tell you to fold under rug tassels and tie up all loose cables etc. We did this (a pain to fold and unfold rugs) but it still got tangled in anything loose (and frequently under a cabinet somewhere). For this reason alone the eufy is unworkable in our house with a number of area rugs and a normal amount of computer, lamp and TV cables. The Roomba navigates these same potential problems with ease, and does not get tangled up. 2) When it does get tangled up or runs up against an obstacle, the front brushes do not stop turning (until forced to) and you can hear the gear wheels jumping in the motor drive. It was my guess that it would not be long before they were completely stripped. 3) The Roomba is solid and strongly built. The eufy by comparison feels fragile and not likely to last long - certainly not the 10 years plus of the Roomba. 4) The eufy often does not return to the base and you have to search to find it. Also the obstacle recognition and diversion algorithm seems wrong - it will often move away from walls and not actually ever vacuum close to the wall. Infrequently it will, but the Roomba has this worked out well and moves along the bottom of a wall it encounters with the spinning front brush in the wall/floor corner. It is quieter than the Roomba but not as good and the cost is nearly the same as a Roomba 600 series. I suspect it may not be much better than a number of the other Chinese machines out there selling for less.","Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2019"

B07R295MLS,3,Clean those sensors? Sensitive to intense sunlight?,"Update 2 1/24/2020 The replacement has taken multiple suicidal dives down the maple wood stairs to the Basement. I have deduced that the sensors get a little dirty and stop working. Sunlight probable exacerbates. The little guy still kinda works. It seems the replacement is built like a tank. Albeit: confused/blind/challenged I added a star today, and maybe add another if I get another response. Kudos to Eufy's customer support. It is one of the the best I've dealt with on Amazon. Update 5/27/19: I was sent a new Eufy and was very impressed by the customer service. Unfortunately this one also drove off the stairs after a few months. I now believe the cause of the suicide attempts are due to the intense afternoon sun streaming in the Windows onto the wood floors, and messing with the sensors and really confusing the little guys. I feel bad, but I plan too again ask eufy for another replacement.... THis is the second time trying to review this product. The first review was tossed as it was flagged for being too positive. I'm glad, because my opinion has changed a bit. Since then I had sent in the first unit due to the rubber tearing off the bottom, and Euffy's non-response to my questions regarding the torn strip. I purchased a second unit and used the little guy for about 4 months with good results. other than: 1. The little rubber strip tore again. The uit still cleans OK but will has lost some suction (due to rubber strip being gone) on hard flooring and likely leaves debris behind. 2. Last night the stair sensors must have quit working and our little guy committed robocide. RIP....

Cannot see spending more when the darned machines break down every two years, can’t get OEM parts, etc. Differences - seems a wee bit quieter than the old machine. Runs longer, probably due to new battery. Also seems to go under more furniture, because the device is not as tall. As a result, it will get stuck. Every day. Multiple times a day. Tangled in wires. Under the bed. And so on. It is now part of the daily routine to find the vacuum, often getting down on the floor to pull it out from wherever, then empty and put it on charge. Deebot had an app. Did not do much, but much better than the remote this came with. And if there was charge remaining, you could use the app to make the Deebot beep, which greatly enabled locating the device. All in all, not much money. And, gets stuck.

B07R295MLS,3,Constantly Gets Stuck,"I loved this as a basic, quiet bot cleaner. Unfortunately it constantly gets stuck in my furniture. I had a Roomba i7+ for several years and I can't remember it getting stuck even once. Had to return this.","Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2024"
B07R295MLS,3,"Great vacuum, but lacks any intelligence.","I had been considering getting a Roomba, but kept balking at the price. When I saw this one on Amazon, and on sale, I decided to give it a shot, since it was less than 1/3 the cost of the Roomba that I had been considering. Overall, I've been pretty pleased with the purchase. I'm always impressed to see the amount of stuff that this thing picks up from our floors! We do have a dog that sheds, and we've definitely noticed less bunches of dog hair on the floor. Be warned, this unit will find and get caught on ANY wires/string/cords that are left around the house. Think about shoestrings from shoes, electronics charging cords, pulls for blinds, etc. I guess it's easy enough to avoid these things if you are vacuuming on your own, but with this device, you'll need to change some behaviors in order to make sure it isn't frequently getting stranded before it can finish vacuuming. My main beef with this unit is that it lacks any intelligence whatsoever. If you want a device that is ""set and forget,"" I don't think this is the one for you. It does allow for scheduling, so technically you should be able to schedule your cleaning in the middle of the night, and this thing should vacuum until almost dead, and then make its way back to its charging station. That rarely happens in our experience. Almost every morning, we have to hunt to find out where it died at, and then manually return it to its charging station. We've resorted to running it in the day time so we can watch it. Just now, I was observing it, and even if it comes within inches of its charging station, it will literally run into the wall, and then turn and go in a different direction. It seems to be a ""random walker,"" meaning it has an infinitesimally small, but non-zero chance of making it back to its charging station. If it weren't for that, I'd give this unit five stars. But I will be keeping it considering the sale price I was able to purchase it for.","Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2020"
B07R295MLS,3,It’s a basic robot vacuum that just cruises,"This Eufy is acceptable and basic. This was my first robot vacuum and I did a lot of research and decided upon this model without any frills because it is affordable. I wanted to be able to to determine if having a robot vacuum was a good choice for us. Before spending a large amount of money. I can say that this model is not that smart. It often tries to climb up table legs or it tries to go out the sliding glass door frame and it does not really clean an entire area at all. It just cruises without directions and picks up what it finds along the way. When we clean out the filters there is a lot of my lab’s dog fur so I know it does collect it decently. We run 4 days a week and only on our tile. Sometimes it has a hard time finding it’s home and we help it. I don’t think this is a very special unit as it does not impress me but we continue to use it. I do like the filter cleaner brush and the fact that it cuts hair off the roller. That makes it sooo much easier to take hair off all of our vacuum rollers. I would appreciate a model that maps out where it’s going so it does not miss so many areas and this unit does miss quite a bit. It does sow down around edges and it does a decent job of collecting a lot but it does not collect everything and misses many areas. I have started to notice the legs (that spin and collect dirt) under Eufy have already started to bend which is a bummer since we have only had it a couple of months but it did come with another set. However, I’m starting to wonder if those won’t last long either and if we will have to confuse to purchase new ones every few months. I hope not.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2020"
B07R295MLS,3,Not for deep cleaning,"I bought this to keep up with the fur tumbleweeds produced by our two cats. At a price point of $139, I’m not super impressed. PROS: It’s pretty quiet. It helps maintain clean floors in between using my hand-held Shark vacuum. Does great at rolling from hardwoods into our carpeted bedrooms. Gets stuck seldomly. Cons: Takes several hours to fully charge. Bumps into EVERYTHING despite having sensors. Doesn’t clean the nooks and crannies like a typical vacuum. Takes a long time to find home base. I’m extra mad at it today because it ATE my cat’s food! Literally rolled right onto the plate and devoured it. I spent hours trying to get wet puréed salmon out of the crevices. Again, I thought this had sensors to prevent that kind of thing?! The capsule that stores all the dirt and fur is very small, so I find myself babysitting the vacuum (which we named Vic the Vac) so as to empty it about every half hour. Vic loves to eat wires. According to the manual, parts must be replaced pretty often to keep it in tiptop condition. I thought I would love having a robovac. Thought it would change my friggin life. The reality is: my cheaper Shark is still the boss of the floors. 🤷🏽‍♀️","Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2023"
B07R295MLS,3,It certainly does it's job as a vacuum.,"Like the headline says, it's a vacuum and it does that job well. The controls are simple and very easy to use, not to mention receptive. However, after using this thing every day for a week, it certainly has it's quirks. 1. It is stubborn as hell. It REALLY wants to get into those areas it can't. Sometimes it tries to wedge itself under my coffee table, and when I use the remote to maneuver it away, it will immediately turn back and try to go under the table again. It does this repeatedly, sometimes I have to pick it up and physically move it to a different location before it goes somewhere else. 2. It has absolutely no rhyme or reason in the direction it goes and it is VERY sporadic. If it's headed in one direction and runs into an object, it will pivot and shoot out in a completely different direction instead of staying mostly on course. It will 'clean' one area over and over again until it just so happens to go through a different doorway, and because of this it takes a long time to do a full clean of my apartment. 3. It's very finicky when it comes to heights. I have two doorways that have the teeniest little doorframes on the bottom that it will get itself halfway onto and then lose all gusto. I have carpets thicker than that that it has no problem getting onto, but these ledges are just too extreme of a difference I suppose. Overall, it's not a bad purchase, but the entire reason I bought it was to use before I get home from work and due to these small issues that's not entirely plausible.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2021"
B07R295MLS,2,3 DEFECTIVE UNITS....WHAT NOW? UPDATE!!,"Get comfortable everyone this is a long story. But this also needs to be read. I have basically a opened floor house plan house. I had bought my first Eufy 11S 3 weeks ago. I was so excited to get it. So hopeful that this would be my answers to being able to keep my floors A lil cleaner without having to sweep 2 times a day. ( I have 2 pets) The 11 S started having issues right out of the box. VERY low suction even on IQboost it would leave hair in the floor and also acting erratically and shutting off for no apparent reason after being fully charged over night. DID ALL the troubleshooting listed in the book nothing worked So I contacted Customer service. She had advised me that that was not normal behavior and suggested I get a upgrade from the 11S and get the 11S MAX and said that I could either send it back to them for a exchange and have to do without it for about 3 weeks OR I could do exchange three Amazon. So I decided to go threw Amazon did a return ... then after the refund I purchased the 11S MAX. ( which is quite a bit more money of course) I received the 11S MAX AND ITS BEEN NOTHING BUT ISSUE AFTER ISSUE. It will only run for around 45 minutes at a time on AUTOMATIC (on regular floors) at a time, WILL RUN RIGHT OVER PET HAIR AND WILL LEAVE IT ON THE FLOOR, WILL GET STUCK AGAINST EVERYTHING(will continue to turn back and forth up against something but won’t back up to move away from it..... and will continue to beep. I will move it away from the spot and before I can sit back down it’s right back where it got stuck at. CAN NOT FIND THE DOCKING STATION TO CHARGE. I have to get up and go find it and put it on. Will sometimes just stop in the middle of the floor ( with nothing around it) and will spin and beep in a circle. ALL of these things are sporadic sometimes it will also be going in a straight line and turn for no reason. He acts erratic and he does these things off and on the whole time it’s on. While it’s moving around my house I’m up getting him out of trouble or doing troubleshooting than I get to actually sit down. And for some reason it’s IN LOVE with my refrigerator... it GETS STUCK THERE ALL THE TIME ... AND it tries to push his way under it while it’s beeping. AND YES I have and will cleaned all the brushes, dust bun, clean all the sensors, make sure the number isn’t stuck. Everything. I know the drill from owning the 11S and trying to trouble shoot it when it would do all these things. I’m disabled and on a fixed income. My son is currently deployed overseas for the military... around Christmas time he had sent me the money and a beautiful letter so I would be able to buy one of these for myself as a gift from him. I have NOT spoken to him since early October so if you are from a Military Family you know how stressful it is not to hear from them. And ANYTHING they are able to send to you makes anything and everything more PRECIOUS. So I love this lil robot. I had done a lot of research and it seemed that Eufy had the best customer service ratings as well as their lil robots. BUT for me it has been one disappointment after another. I’m not sure what I’m going to be able to do... like I said earlier I’m disabled and it was hard returning the first one. Then spending more money to have to upgrade, at this point I’m just so heartbroken about the whole ordeal. Maybe I would have had better luck with a different brand. I’m at a loss. My son had sent me the money to buy this thing as a gift. But to buy anything other than this one as a upgrade compared to the price point of this one .... I don’t have the money to do that. I’m on a fixed income and I would have to spend more money to get ANY KIND of upgrade.... I’m disabled and having to bend over and getting up and down constantly has really started causing me sever pain. I recently had a pain pump installed in my back and I have a catheter that is along the inside of my spinal cord. Also fusions in my neck, bulging discs, and pinched nerves all along my cervical and lumbar spine . So I can’t mop the floor and sweeping is almost as bad at causing pain. I was so looking forward to this lil guy. I even called him JOHNNY 5. Lol from that 80s movie Short Circuit. But like I said it’s been nothing but a disappointment. I will contact the Eufy Company again and see what could be done and I will update you guys to see what the end result has been if anything. I guess I will see first hand in how well their Customer Service is when someone has had to deal with 2 Defective units. Thank guys for reading. UPDATE: Well I had contacted Customer service and they had sent me a replacement robot... Worked great ... with no issues.... fell in love with him.... named him Johnny 5 max... then it started....He will be moving along then suddenly stop and start turning circles then stop and start beeping... It will do this randomly... and he leaves behind dog hair that I have to go back to sweep up ..(I have a German Shepherd) ..it will be going in a straight line then suddenly just stop to turn for NO REASON!! He will not go back to the dock on its own most times .. even if it is right in front of the charger.. it will spin circles... Then move in the opposite direction ... stop and do complete circles... I literally have to pick it up MOST times to put it on the charger.. I have cleaned and inspected then cleaned him some more and I see nothing wrong... I have done so much research on these lil boys and I thought I was buying the best for the money... and the customer service ... was great to try to send me a replacement but it doesn’t help if this has been a recurring problem with these lil bots ... they are just sending back out something that is defective with the bot... this is the 3rd robot that I have had by Eufy. The first one was a 11s.. the last 2 have been 11sMax.. I returned the 11s back to Amazon .. as the customer service had suggested and bought ( of course for more money) the 11sMax... I had issues with that one ... then called customer service and they sent the replacement .. The first 2 had similar issues... At this point I’m not sure if I would accept a replacement... maybe if it was for a upgrade from this one... I think I’m done with the Eufy 11s’. OR if I would just like a refund and go with a different brand all together. I added a star for Customer Service. Maybe .. Eufy will reach out to me after reading this and see what can (if anything) can be done UPDATE 2~~ Lil Johnny 5 came out today to do his job. He ran for about 10 minutes... was doing fine.... his light on top turned orange.... then the suction turned off for no reason... so I picked him up cleaned his brushes... cleaned the filter, checked all 3 wheels, cleaned the front of it... turned him back on and that didn’t help... he’s currently on the charger and charging again... I think I’m going to call customer service and see what can be done... I’ll update again later...","Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2020"
B07R295MLS,2,Not as handy as I’d hoped…,"This is my first purchase of any kind of robot vacuum, so I can’t provide any comparisons with others. Keep this in mind as you read my review. I thought this vacuum would help me reduce the amount of time I spend on house chores by doing the vacuuming for me, but I have discovered that it is no less work just running my traditional electric vacuum, which does a better job of picking up dust, pet hair, and crumbs than this vacuum does. This vacuum has an automatic, timed daily schedule of 30 minutes in duration. You set the time you want the vacuum to clean, and each day it will start at that time. However, it will clean random strips of floor in an unpredictable manner. The other functions are ones you have to control with the provided remote - and they have their own issues as well - but I will just focus on the timed/scheduled function, because that’s why I bought this vacuum…to do it for me. Does it, though? Not really. With the scheduled cleaning, it moves at random. The best way I can describe it is if the vacuum was a pinball and your room was a pinball machine. If it bumps into a barrier, it will perform either a 120 degree or 240 degree rotation, and then move forward until it hits another barrier, then repeats the same rotation and goes off in yet another direction. This means it can get stuck in smaller rooms more easily, covering the same area repeatedly until the cleaning cycle ends. For example, I have my vacuum set up in the living room, where there is ample wood floor to cover. There is a small guest bathroom just off the living room. The vacuum starts up precisely at the timed setting each day, and makes perhaps 2-3 passes in the living room, cleaning in a strip about 4” wide, but inevitably ends up in the little bathroom for the majority of the 30 minute cleaning cycle as it blindly bumps its way around, seemingly trapped in an endless sequence of bumps and turns, unable to rotate out of the doorway of the bathroom and back to the living room. I often just have to take control over the vacuum and guide it out of the doorway, but if I have to be there watching the vacuum, then I can’t run this setting while I’m not home. It would probably be okay for placing in one small room like a bedroom, but the docking station has to be out in an open space. So, you’d have to carry the vacuum or remotely move it off the dock to the desired room, turn it on, and shut the door on the way out. But the vacuum probably wont shut off on its own this way… Another issue is with the end of the timed cleaning cycle. My vacuum usually does not find its docking station and turn off after 30 minutes. It will keep on cleaning until I turn it off or move it close to the dock. I have the docking station set up in an open area where there is nothing within 6 feet of it on either side, and 12 feet on the front. However, if the vacuum is outside of the range of the dock, it won’t find it and it will just keep cleaning (I suppose until it runs out of battery if you don’t intervene). I take over control with the remote and maneuver it back towards the dock. Once it gets close, it will link up and dock itself. Certain obstacles can be an amusing and/or frustrating nightmare. Pet food dishes, charging cords, and plastic bags have to be removed from any area the vacuum could end up. This may seem to be a no-brainer, but if you don’t survey the area and remove potential hazards first, you might wind up with a disaster. The vacuum will get caught in any cords or loose plastic baggies on the floor. It once yanked my partner’s phone charger from the wall and dragged it across the room and under the bed. We spent a half hour searching for his missing charger, wondering who took it and didn’t put it back, only to discover that the vacuum stole it! It will climb onto my pet food mat and proceed to wreak havoc with the food dishes, throwing food here and there as it pushes the bowls around, vacuuming up bits of kibble, and getting stuck on the larger pieces of kibble. Here I thought I bought a cleaning machine, and instead I got a tiny tornado terror. Sometimes it’s a mess to clean up after my robot! Finally, this vacuum is really loud. I sure wish I didn’t have to babysit it and could run it while I’m not home, but I can’t trust this thing to run without a hitch. On the bright side, I’m impressed that it does start at the right time every day. I like that it docks itself on the charging dock (if it can find it). I am also impressed that it does not fall down the staircase when it reaches the top stair, as advertised. The bumper also does not cause any damage to my walls or furniture. So, they got some things right with this vacuum. Would I recommend it, though? Nah. Not unless you have a good sense of humor and money to blow.","Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2023"
B07R295MLS,2,"Not smart, annoying","******** UPDATE ******** Buy a better version that is ""smart"" with mapping. Over time, this thing has become incredibly annoying primarily because it lacks mapping. There are a few problem areas in my house where this vacuum gets stuck. It will get stuck under one corner of my refrigerator if it hits it at a certain angle. It will also get stuck under my dogs elevated bed. A few times it has also high-centered on the feet of my computer desk. Any of these scenarios requires it to be rescued. Closets, bedrooms, and anything with a door has the potential to trap this thing. It's not unusual for this thing to shut itself in a room by pushing the door closed thus spending the full cleaning period in a single bedroom and failing to return home. All of these things are annoying, but manageable. However, because it lacks mapping it will hit those trouble spots an unknown number of times per night. Could be 0, because it sometimes misses entire rooms. It could also be 5 times in one night. The fact that it has already thoroughly cleaned under the dog bed once and proceeds to get stuck there multiple more times throughout the next hour is stupid. Currently this thing runs nightly and it has probably a 15% chance of finishing its full cycle without human help. To solve that problem I would need to build a bumper around my refrigerator, bumper around my dog bed, latch my doors open so they can't be closed and completely shut my office door. Mapping and thus only hitting this trouble spots once per night would greatly improve that 15%. ******** The Good: I have a large white dog that sheds horribly due to thyroid problems. To put it in perspective, my mother has 6 dogs and we have more of a shedding problem in our house. Previously we would do full home vacuuming, upstairs and downstairs, on Wednesday and Saturday. I'm not talking about about a quick 5 minute vacuum of problem areas, I'm talking 40+ minutes of work. We would also change our home air filters three times as often as other people. It was a pain and a time sink. This does exactly what we needed it to do - control the hair. We only do full house vacuums once a week now and there is far less to get up on that day. The floor just always feels clean now. I'm not saying other robot vacuum options wouldn't also work, I'm just happy enough with this one that I'm not looking elsewhere right now. The good far outweighs the bad, it just works. However, I've taken more notes on the problem areas than the expectations it did meet, so.... The Annoying: It needs mapping. There are times when it's wrapping up it's cleaning cycle and starts returning to home where it's just painful to watch. It's almost as if it doesn't find the base station within a few minutes, it falls back to the whole edge mode process. While it always eventually finds home, if it tries returning to home in the wrong spot, say the same room as the charging station but separated by a few couches and tables, it can and often will take the longest imaginable path trying to return home. I've seen it spend 20 minutes circling the entire perimeter of my house in edge mode trying to return home when it started returning to home in the same room as the charging station. It will go in literally every room, closet every bedroom nook, under beds, in bathrooms, around every piece of furniture, etc. trying to get to the home station NOW on the other side of the house. All while constantly bumping the wall, then correcting, bumping wall, go around this table, bumping wall, etc. It has little if any any concept of which direction is should go to attempt to find the base (no mapping). This whole time, it's in return to home low power mode and isn't really cleaning anything. When the task becomes ""return home"", it just seems... a little too dumb. It's always made it back before dying, but just barely. I fill it up EVERY TIME. See above, shedding dog. Which is also a good thing, because it's working, but it's just one more thing I have to remember to do every morning. I will always want a bigger bin. The bad: Non-flat rugs will need work. It was always getting hung up on and rolling the corners over. It wasn't uncommon for the edge brushes to get knocked off getting hung up in rugs. We added Curl Stop to all the problem rugs and solved that problem. Bath mats will also cause problems obviously so you may have to adjust your routine and begin picking them up. We now lay ours over the bathtub after use. Pet food bowls can be a problem. If you have plain round bowls, this thing can and will knock them over. Sometimes it would hit them directly, detect them and properly avoid them, especially if they were full. Other times it would hit them indirectly and proceed to roll them around spilling food and water everywhere. It's happened several times and will require different food and water dishes or elevating them. The last time it happened it sucked up a bunch of water. Luckily I heard the bowl rolling around and was able to save it. Is there a way to schedule two daily cleanings? I haven't found it. There appears to only be a once daily schedule. There is no app, just a remote control, so I doubt I will ever see an update to add this feature. If you have a large house with a complex floor plan, one session isn't going to cut it. There are times it runs a full cycle and misses a bedroom or clearly misses portions of the floor. If the floor plan is small enough, I 100% believe it would get everything. There are days I wouldn't mind this thing running twice a day - say 8am and 8pm. I'm just not always home to kick it off manually..","Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2020"
B07R295MLS,2,I don't understand the high ratings,"I was excited to try this thing out based on the very high number of excellent ratings, but after using it I have no idea why so many people seem to like this thing so much, unless they're not real reviews. Here's my take, though please note I've never owned a robot vacuum so I have no basis for comparison: Pros: -slim, fits under my kitchen counters to get at the hard to reach parts -quiet, I didn't find it to disruptive That's it. That's all I really liked. Cons: -Listing says it has ""Anti-collision sensors ensure RoboVac doesn’t bump into objects around the house."" I'd say it hit walls and/or objects about 70-80% of the time; sometimes it almost seemed to intentionally bang into stuff, and actually did scuff some of my furniture. -No mapping/learning. This is probably on me, but I expected it to learn the layout of my home at least a bit, but come to find out it has zero learning/mapping capabilities. -Completely random cleaning patterns. There is no rhyme or reason to it's cleaning pattern; it just wanders about like a drunken tourist lost in a new city. It repeatedly cleans the same areas over and over and over and over, and yet avoided other, open areas completely. This also meant I had to always know where it was, or run the risk of turning around and finding it right underfoot even though it had been in the entry way around the corner and down the hall only moments before. Folks have said that it eventually gets everything, but I found the random travel and repetition to be maddening and wildly inefficient. -Remote has to be pointed directly at it or it doesn't work at all. While it's more fun to manually drive this thing around than it is to push a vacuum, it's more frustrating and takes 10x as long. And instead of making logical adjustments when manually controlling it, the thing often tries to wildly over-correct or turn completely around instead of just a little bit, so I end up mashing away at the buttons trying to get it to totally cover a 3x5 area. -Auto return to home.... not so much. It repeatedly tried to go the completely wrong direction from the base, or took the absolutely most obstructed path possible, so I had to manually steer it to about 3 feet from the dock before it would finally figure it out. Bottom line: I bought this so I wouldn't have to think about cleaning my floors so much. Instead, I have to babysit the thing and manually direct it to clean some areas, with all the steering control of an old, unmaintained bumper car. Sort of defeats the purpose, and not worth the money I spent, even on sale.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,"Breaks down over a relatively short period of time, noisy, and not as smart as other budget vacuums","**UPDATED 7/19/20** So, shortly after I posted my initial review (below), Eufy reached out to me and said that they would like to send me another (same model) vacuum. First, thank you Eufy. I appreciate you sending it out, even quickly so that I could use this one instead of the one described below. However, I gotta say that here I am again--writing that the vacuum (initially whisper-quiet) is now loud, rattling like crazy, and making washing-machine sounds (think ""agitation cycle"") as it clumsily works it's way across my floor. The floor it cleans is tile, should be easy enough right? The tile is flat, there is no dip in the grout, and the vacuum assists us in picking up dog hair (we have a shepherd) and dust blown across the Atlantic from Africa (Saharan dust). It's light duty really, with no legos or power-cords to get in the way. I am always careful to pick up the house or floor before starting it, as it easily gets hung up on things and won't start he beeping ""help me I'm stuck"" alert unless something is insanely wrong. Speaking of which, the bane of my existence, the vacuum getting stuck on our clothes-drying rack, continually vexes the vacuum by making it seem like it can surmount the 1/2 inch bottom tube on the floor. But it doesn't. And the vacuum gets stuck. Continually. It also can't figure out why. I've yet to see it beep while it's high-centered and making an awful scraping (wheels peeling out on tile) sound and telling itself ""you got this""--but it doesn't. I'm always quick to jump up and unstick it, but sometimes I just want to say ""COME ON!"" and chastise it...but it won't understand. It has also developed the same, exact same...as in same/same/same noises as the last one (read below) that I had. If you start it up, say goodbye to a teleconference, a phonecall, or watching TV without being questioned ""what is that sound? Is that a machine making all that noise?"" or just not being able to run it while you are awake for the sake of your sanity. I don't dare run it while I'm gone as it'll suck in the edge of the dog-bed, get stuck on the dog's rubber feeding mat (dog bowl on rubber mat to keep the area clean), or try yet AGAIN to surmount the drying rack...and fail. So, here's my grade report: Don't buy it. I don't know WHY this version is so loud. It's very annoying, and it very quickly goes from ""I'm quiet"" to LISTEN TO MY NOISES in less than a two weeks. BTW, we run it once daily, so after 14-times...losing the quietness and becoming a noise-maker on wheels...no thanks. This is my last year in San Juan, PR. When I move back to Virginia next year I'm going to either donate or mothball these and probably purchase something more reliable and proven to be quiet. I'll never NOT have a robot vacuum, they are indispensable, but for God's sake...this version is so noisy and clumsy...it's just a pain in the rear. Sorry Eufy, keeping my review the same. I appreciate the customer service, but it just doesn't equate to a quality purchase in my experience. Good luck. Read below for my initial review. **Initial Review** At first I was pretty happy with this vacuum. It is very low profile and was super quiet. Then, after a short period of time, the sensor on the front stopped (I clean it regularly and make sure it's polished and streak-free) working and it started banging into everything. Like...everything. And it also stopped noticing the stairs drop-off so it now gets stuck on the first step down our stairs because it doesn't stop. Additionally, the roller and brushes fail to pick up dog hair like my last vacuum (also a budget vacuum, but going to buy it again...not a Eufy), so although I clean and replace the filters and brushes on the recommended schedule, it leaves piles of dog hair all around the house. Which...aren't there in the first place: The vacuum creates a pile and pushes it around the house. Our last vacuum didn't do this. The most annoying thing now is that the roller brush, nearing about 3/4 life, is so noisy that it sounds like a garbage truck running through the house. It's literally doing it right now which prompted me to write this review. So...sensors not working, not smart enough to stop at the stairs, doesn't pick up dog hair, and noisy as F. I feel like whatever company Eufy is...I got ripped off. This version was touted as super slim, powerful and smart, with a surge capability, and quiet. Only one thing is true--it's low profile/slim. But that just means that places where my last vacuum couldn't go, now the Eufy gets wedged in under there and I have to lift the bathroom vanity up (no easy task as it's connected to pipes) in order to free it. So there you have it. Buy at your own risk. Will not hook up to internet, noisy, obnoxious, doesn't clean well...and I haven't even talked about the filters that are way overpriced and supposedly last 5 times as long as other filters (not true, they are encased in plastic and get just as dirty). Good luck to you if you've already purchased one. Unfortunately I have to buy another vacuum today because Eufy sucks that bad. Awesome.","Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2020"

I know, kitchen appliances and vacuums for Christmas are SO romantic. I've learned what's more important than getting the lady in one's life a shiny, super expensive, and often useless gift that society says she should love, is actually knowing her well enough to get her what she will appreciate. My wife says getting these kind of labor saving devices for her are like when I ask her for tools for Christmas. Now THAT'S romance!! So, day 1 to 365 of your new Eufy life, all is well. Your cute little Euf (my kids wanted to put large stick-on googly eyes on it--these should come in the box IMO) Eufy will dutifully bounce around your space like a massive geriatric air hockey puck, spreading clean vibes everywhere. What's more, Eufy will gladly send you a replacement vac if yours stops working due to a manufacturing defect. All is happy in Wester-wherever. But as the Starks of that fictional land (sort of) say, Day 366 is coming. Day 366 and thereafter, so sorry, but if your geriatric air hockey puck breaks a hip (or anything else) you now have an oversized discus with a rechargeable battery where your cute young robovac used to be. Perhaps the Eufy brand could consider rearranging the letters of their post-warranty parts and repair service to Efyu if things don't change (and I hope they will). Eufy chat folks were friendly and courteous, but repairs after warranty? Nope. Internal parts? Not so much. Maybe someone on eBay gave another dead Eufy the vulture treatment and you'll get lucky to find parts, but not likely. Direct copy/paste from Eufy chat after I told them that replacing the brush (as recommended) didn't fix the loud rattling noise (This chat session may not be monitored for quality assurance): Eufy rep- ""unfortuntely there isnt anything we can do if you're out of warranty, I am sorry. My best suggestion would be to take it to a vacuum or electronics repair shop to see if they can figure out the noise."" That noise? Oh, that's just the sound of the hopes that I bought the right brand of robovac for my wife dying a sudden, untimely death. Press politely and they'll offer 15% off a new Eufy, or a refurbished model for $80 (with no warranty). Nice thought, but seriously?? Sign me up!! Yes!! The one with no warranty that broke for somebody else!! I must have it!! After that, think I'll go buy a Powerball lotto ticket with last week's winning numbers and then go drop $500 on the ring toss game at the carnival. I just know I'll win the giant stuffed T. Rex with a bowtie and top hat! So, barring some unexpected change, yet another round brick of e-waste heads to the landfill for future generations to mine when the world goes total Mad Max/Idiocracy/Bladerunner/Hunger Games. Sorry (not sorry), but if the Eufy people can't offer a repair program (for which I'd pay a reasonable amount to keep our little robo sucker out of the landfill) for more than 365 days, or parts, service, etc, then it makes me wonder, are their products designed not to last in hopes that you'll buy another from them when your little drone vac goes to that great landfill piled to the sky? Maybe not, but we got 1.5 years out of our little dust bunny eater before it quit working correctly. It was so young!! Oh, the humanity!!! Or, robotity... One thing's for sure. Our future robot overlords will not look upon this kindly. I understand this is a cheaper model, somewhat akin to a Melissa and Doug My First RoboSuck, and maybe I should dial back my expectations. Still if Hoover/Eureka/Bissell can build a cheap manual vac that lasts 5 to 10 years, is it too much to ask Eufy to keep some tech out of the landfill a few extra years and engineer a better product, or at least offer replacement parts and a repair center or repair network? I want to love them again, but it is my opinion that one should tread carefully before selecting Eufy as the vac that your cat rides for Mewtube videos. The first (and likely last) Eufy we've ever owned is headed toward an early grave, and sadly so is my opinion of a brand that I once recommended to many people.","Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2020"
B07R295MLS,2,Not impressed,"1) It gets stuck, a lot, between chair legs, under furniture (seems to be able to get under sofas, but then cannot get out), behind chairs (and cannot seem to find its way out). 1a) One reason it gets stuck (after observing it many times)... eventually it starts to run low on power. But before it has decided that it is so low on power that it should return to the base, it is still trying to clean. But at this point it does not have enough power to move from a hardwood floor to a carpet, or over any bump, etc. So it just weakly tries, over and over again, to get over a carpet edge, until it dies. 2) It is too random. It misses a lot of dirt right next to where it just cleaned. 3) Its suction is not the greatest. 4) Hair tangles way too easily in the brush. In fact, hardly any long hair makes its way into the dust bin, as it never gets past the brush roller. 5) When cleaning multiple rooms, it often starts to lose energy far from its base, and then cannot seem to find its way back to the base before it totally runs out of power -- just randomly stopping anywhere. 6) The dust collection bin is a mess to empty. And considering how little it holds, it must be emptied often. 7) Between spending time trying to find the robot (when it is not on the base as expected), cleaning up after emptying the dust bin, and detangling hair from the roller, my time would be better spent using a regular vacuum cleaner.","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,11S isn't what it used to be,"I had an older version of the 11S that worked for YEARS. Always kept the floors so clean, and I have tile, wool rugs (wool sheds a lot), girls with long hair, and wood floors (approx 2000 sq ft). It was an amazing unit. I also bought an L70 unit just for mopping, maybe 2 years ago. When my husband decided to service the older 11S unit, he did something and it is now dead. So, I bought this new version. The new version only has 1 brush at the front, and in my experience, means it picks up far less. The L70 has only one rotating brush, and could never keep up with the older 11S in terms of dirt pickup. It is crazy loud, and this is coming from someone who has had a iRobot, and 2 prior eufy's. Additionally, after initiating its maiden run, it almost immediately got stuck on a dining room chair's legs and couldn't get unstuck. There is no map with this unit, whereas the L70 has a map, and I do think there is value for a map, but not at the expense of inferior pickup, which is why I opted to replace the older 11S. Needless to say, I already sent it back. Quality was just not there any more, which is a shame because the 11S was such a good vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,Would not buy again,"This vacuum has no pattern that it follows that I can tell. It just randomly goes where ever it wants. It does not make straight lines, it follows more of a diagonal. It never covers my whole floor. I'm always having to go back over with my stick vacuum. Every time I start it up, it changes which direction it goes. It get's stuck, which I understand but once I clear it and set it on it's new path it will go right back to where it was stuck and get stuck again! I've had an iRobot and I will be going back to that brand. It is much more consistent and I can feel comfortable knowing it actually covered my entire floor. I do not recommend this product.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,Not practical for actual use,"2 stars are generous. We have owned this thing for a couple months at least now. We purchased it so that we could have minor vacuuming done w/o necessitating our involvement. This is an absolute fail. We have to pick up all rugs, shoes, cat toys etc. basically it takes a total pre-cleaning, and the … This wretched thing STILL hangs up, gets stuck, grounds itself under things, gets stuck trying to climb barstool legs, has tiny capacity, and needs constant attention. If you want this to just do its job w/o having to babysit it every 5 mins you will be sorely disappointed. Do not waste your time buying unless you plan on wasting even more of your time resetting it and emptying and sweeping up behind it.","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,It had a good 8 month run....,"Edit: it just started working out of nowhere again today! It has a timer to run at 9:15am every day, and it just started up at about noon. It got almost immediately stuck under the table again, and I do feel like it is on its last legs. We will still be shopping for a different machine, but atleast for today, it’s still running! Original post: Well, I decided to give this a try as we had never had a robot vacuum before and we hate the grit feeling on the floor between sweeping. My husband wasn’t impressed with the purchase at first because he said we can sweep the floor for free. Well, he became this little guys biggest cheerleader. We loved him! Named him “Dirty Harry”. He did great! We were amazed at the amount of dirt, debris, and hair he would pick up every single day! We had him set up on a timer for him to begin cleaning every day at 9:15am. We would smile in the morning when we would hear our young daughter say “good morning Dirty Harry” and we would scotch around and pick up anything that may be on the floor (cords, toys, whatever). Well, last night Dirty Harry breathed his last breath. He died trying to get back into his charger. Like, not just ran out of battery. Even if I sat him on his charger, he wouldn’t take a charge anymore. While we really did love him, there were a few things we didn’t appreciate about him. He would always get stuck under our dining room table. There is a piece of decorative wood under our dining room table that, near the end of his life, he would consistently try to wedge himself under. His sensors would work in every other case, but when it came to that table, he was determined that he would try and cram himself under there. He would be so stuck that we would literally have to left the table to dislodge him. We finally had to barricade the table bottom with board games or tip over chairs in front of it so he’d get the hint. That’s annoying. We also wish the charger base had more weight to it. He would often move it to the side trying to place himself on it, so I finally taped it to the floor. It looks tacky, but it helped. He also would suck up cords like a champ, so we had to always be vigilant that a charger cord were picked up, or the cord to our electric recliner was draped over the end table, and we tied all the tv and media cords up to the back of our tv stand so he didn’t suck them up. It’s like baby-proofing a house for a toddler. But that’s going to be expected for any robot servant in the house, so we gladly made the changes to accommodate. We did love how he picked up so much off of our carpet and hardwood floors every day! In our house we are down to us, our one 6 year old daughter (the other 6 kids have all moved out now), and one cat. He wasn’t too loud, and up until recently, didn’t give us too much trouble. One thing we wish he had was the ability to map a room - he did often go over some spots time and time again, and sometimes would miss others. His path seemed pretty random, but you get what you pay for. We will definitely splurge on our next one and buy a more expensive brand that will last longer. We did love you Dirty Harry!!!","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2021"
B07R295MLS,2,"You don't have to vacuum, but that surely comes at a price!","I'm a little bit disappointed with the Eufy 11S Robovac. I previously owned a Roomba 500 series back in 2007 and found that the technology, while appealing, was not very usable at the time. At least, the convenience of having a robot vacuum was overshadowed by the annoyance of needing to prepare for the vacuum to run and remembering to run it. I had read a few articles recently about how the technology was finally ready for mainstream use and so, after doing a fair amount of research, I was excited to give the Eufy a try. Unfortunately, I'm not seeing much of an improvement from the Roomba model from 2007. The vacuuming is about the same - it worked well at that back then and the Eufy does a decent job with that as well. There are times where there is clearly something on the floor and the Eufy brushes just push it behind the vacuum, but it usually makes another pass and ends up getting anything that is visible. The battery life is pretty solid. Batteries have come a long way in 10+ years, after all, so that is kind of expected. I will say that I never had battery issues with the Roomba, but the Eufy does run for longer. I feel like if the algorithm were a bit better might not need to run quite so long. The vacuum is advertised as ""super quiet"", and it was the first time I ran it. Since then, it has gotten louder and it about the same volume as the old Roomba. I'm a bit disappointed in that, since I work from home and was hoping that I could run it during the day without it interrupting conference calls. That's not the case, though - I have to pause it when I take a call. Maybe more expensive models are quieter or maybe this is just as quiet as it goes, but it definitely was not as loud the first time I ran it so I wonder if something is not right. And that leads me to the quality of the parts. The brushes seem super cheap and the front of the vacuum already looks like it's all beat up after running it just 3 times. I'm not sure why such cheap plastic was used, but I'm worried about how long it will last. There are two extra brushes included in the box, but I'm not sure I want to have to pay for replacements so often. My main disappointment is that the algorithm for how the vacuum runs and the object sensing mechanisms haven't improved much in 10 years. The Eufy gets caught on EVERYTHING. Low hanging curtains, surge protectors, furniture - you name it. They provide you with a few cable ties in the box, but people have to have cords somewhere. My entertainment center is high enough off the ground that the Eufy can get underneath it, and I have the equipment plugged into a surge protector (as one should - it's not cheap stuff). The surge protector cord touches the ground along a wall for less than a foot and is quite thick, but the Eufy has gotten stuck on it every time. If I try to pull the cord up, the cords that are plugged into the surge protector drape and the Eufy gets stuck in those. There doesn't appear to be a way to handle this that isn't a fire hazard. It looks like the more expensive Eufys have some magnetic tape that you can put around obstacles like this to block the Eufy from accessing, but this one doesn't offer any of that. It's a bit of a disappointment, as 10 years ago Roomba offered a device that would allow you to section off an area that the vacuum shouldn't go. I'm not sure if I'm going to keep the Eufy or switch to another brand. I'd recommend purchasing a more expensive model if you're expecting any technological improvements or really want this to make your life easier. I paid a bit more for my Roomba back in the day, so there is a slight cost savings after 10 years to get something similar (without the sectioning off functionality - maybe a little less than similar), but the technological advancements I'm seeing are not nearly what was promised.","Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2019"
B07R295MLS,2,No match for our pets' hair - disappointed,"After this latest shedding season I was ready for pet hair vacuuming help. Saw good reviews for this model, but the Eufy honestly seems overwhelmed by the task. It will leave a clean-ish trail in its wake (light hair on dark carpet), but there us always still a layer of hair on the floor when it's done. Have to clean the bin and brushes 2-3x per session (with another vacuum, ironically), and that's just to for a carpeted living room about 10x20 feet. When it transitions from carpet to linoleum floor it leaves a pile of hair on the threshhold every time -- as if the roller wipes itself off. Will do the same on the floor if I don't stop to clean it often. Bin is barely full, but rollers are completely covered and nonfunctional by then. Seems odd that the suction isn't enough to pull the hair from the rollers so or can keep going. (This is with suction on highest setting.) I tried using the cleaning tool on the roller brush, but it doesn't seem designed for that - the only solution is it pull it off by hand, which is tedious, especially because I have to do it multiple times every time it runs. I should note that I've only used it when the floor is already relatively clean and I just want a touch-up. But I can see there's no way this can replace regular vaccuuming. Even if there are just a few clumps of hair, it only has a 50% success rate picking them up. Usually it can't remove them, or just drags parts of the clump to other areas as it drives over it. It's also very static-y, so I need to clean the outside of the unit each time I use it as well. Tried auto setting -- my floor plan is apparently too difficult for this vac, so I always pick it up, set it where I want it, then ""drive"" it around using the remote. So much for saving time vaccuuming... It also is not able to return to the base successfully, though I don't have the recommended wall space available, so I assume that is the problem. It tried to get there and generally knew where the base was, but I thought it was ruining the outside brushes with repeated attempts ramming the base. I've made myself the designated driver (by picking it up and replacing it), just to be sure it gets home safely. On the plus side, it's surprisingly quiet, though I think it may be because it doesn't have a very powerful motor. It's also kind of fun to drive around (that may wear off since I have to double-vaccuum the vac itself every time I use it...), and the cats are entertained by it. It manages to clean... enough... that the floor looks a bit better when we (not ""it,"" since it requires supervision) are done, but it's no match for the stand-up vac. Have been surprised at reviews saying it works for pet hair - it certainly has not for me, and I may just have to upgrade to a fancier vac with more power to get the help I was hoping for.","Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2021"
B07R295MLS,2,"It does a decent job, but it likes to get stuck, a lot.","The vacuum does a really good job at cleaning, I've been surprised at how much dirt will be in it when it finishes running around the house. Nice that it will drive under furniture. We have had it for a while now and the battery also seems to be holding up well as it will run for a long time, especially on the Boost IQ setting. I would, however, swear that this thing is programmed to seek out places to get stuck, and then actively put effort into getting itself stuck by trying to keep forcing itself under a corner of, say for example, a chair or couch. I have watched it do this, and it will get under a corner of furniture, and instead of backing out, it will keep moving around and driving itself forward until it is completely stuck and then starts it sad beeping. I have actually done things to mitigate this, and it somehow finds new and exciting places to get stuck. It seems like the same thing with cords, if a cord is where it can get to it, it WILL find it. I don't know why it does this, because there are several times it will get within a certain distance of something and turn and drive away. It seems there needs to be improvements made so it won't do this quite as much. Update 6-26-21 - I lowered it another star because of the issues above with it seemingly getting worse about seeking out new and exciting places to get stuck and proceeding to do so, ramming itself into these spots until it takes effort to dislodge it. After a recent power outage, it actually left its charging station at some point (we didn't see it on its station and wondered where it went since no one turned it on), drove around, lost one of its spinning whiskers on a wire that was on the ground (it does this now too) and, you guessed it, found a place to wedge itself under. Perhaps it is an issue with the sensors on it? It also now I've noticed will shove lighter things around as well instead of driving around them. It also seems to have this almost smart--- frustrated move it will also do after it runs itself into something (like even a wall sometimes) where it does this higher pitched whirring noise and spins fast in a circle, and what does this solve? You guessed it, nothing, and to top it off, it almost always spins back to the same direction it was going, rams it and spins its wheels, then does its sad little stupid ""help me"" beeping. Why it would have a sensor issue when it simply just drives around on flat surfaces is somewhat puzzling, unless its relentless desire to wedge itself under objects has finally caused some damage to itself, if that is even the issue. I really don't recommend buying this one and we will be finding something else to replace it once it wears out and/or stops working. I'm sure there must be better ones out there at this point. It still does a decent job cleaning which is still a redeeming quality of it. We recently mopped our floors where it cleans and it was surprisingly very clean. Battery on it is still holding up well. This is only why I didn't drop it to 1 star.","Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2021"
B07R295MLS,2,It gets stuck,"Here’s the thing. Yes it has great “incredible” suction, but BUT it gets stuck all the time, on my fans, in corners, and under things like it doesn’t know how to get out. It also goes in one room and stays in it forever and can’t get through the rest of my tiny apartment. So then I have to manually take it around. I don’t have time for that. It’s a hit or miss if it manages to return to the charging dock. It does take about 5 hours to charge, which I don’t mind if it did my apartment correctly. My apartment is about 800sq ft.

No lines and it missed a considerable amount of carpet. It missed half of my living room then went to bedroom to do the same. I don't have time to watch it and use the remote to drive it like a toy car... defeated the purpose of a robot. I ended up returning it and will get an app smart based one instead.

B07R295MLS,2,Not for us,"We're new to the robot vacuum world, so maybe our expectations were a little too high. We were very disappointed at the quality of cleaning and overall ease of use. We have a 1970s ranch (1000sqft up and 800sqft down) that has been opened up but isn't like the new home style that is totally open. We let this run for 90 minutes upstairs (laminate flooring) and 90 minutes downstairs (carpet) and were extremely disappointed. To start, you need to take everything off the floor before you start. So this could work well if everyone is gone during the day. We have 3 young children and one adult that stays home with them, so it would be much harder to let this run during the day when they are home as the would be getting in the way or wouldn't be able to do anything while it's running. Our house is actually quite tidy, but I still had items to pick up so they wouldn't get sucked up or in the way - things that normally you can move for a moment and then put back right away. Despite being on the quieter setting upstairs, it was actually quite loud - sure it's quieter than a standard vacuum but I was expected a hum like a fan. There's no way any of my child would be able to sleep while i drove past like is shown in the picture. Despite running 90 minutes there was a large area that wasn't ever touched due to the random pattern. It also had trouble anywhere there was furniture because it would bump and turn around to go elsewhere. It spent half the time in the 2 upstairs bedrooms because it couldn't figure out how to get out of the hallway back to the more open living/dining/kitchen area. We put it downstairs and let it run on the high suction setting. It was quieter on the carpet, more like I had expected. The lower level is more sectioned off into rooms and it seemed to do pretty well at doing one room at a time but not getting stuck. It ran for 90 minutes and it seemed to have covered the entire area. You can image my disappointment when I opened the dust canister to find less than a handful of dust. I knew it wasn't that it was already that clean as we hadn't vacuumed in a week and have 3 young kids, a dog and a cat. So we took out our normal vacuum and did the lower level. The picture above shows you what the robot missed - disgusting! I am shocked to see that much was missed. Even if the robot ran daily for a week it wouldn't have equaled that same amount. Needless to say I'm not sold. On top of the vacuum not really working, it was a pain to pick up every cord and little thing that could get sucked up. The robot itself is also much larger than I expected. I had only seen the height dimensions so I guess I had envisioned a 6-8"" hockey puck with super powerful suction that could just buzz around and vacuum all day long while you're home. So, I could see this working for the following groups of people: - family with adults that all work full time and kids are in school full time so no one is home all day making their home dirty - people who live in a large open-concept home with minimal furniture - people with a closed floor plan that plan to have it do one room at a time If you purchase this you will still need to do a more thorough vacuum once a week based on what it didn't pick up on it's run.","Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2019"

It will obsessively clean the same spots and ignore the rest of the room then randomly roll across the room to another area. It doesn’t ever decide it’s done because it has no idea where it’s been so it will run until the battery dies and still miss 1/3 of the room. On the other hand, it does have suction and seems like it would be durable, so I gave it 2 stars for that. I will also admit that I was so pleased with the durability and stability that I bought the same brand only with the room mapping and I LOVE it.

B07R295MLS,2,Falls down carpeted stairs,"Having recently purchased my dream home I quickly came to the realization that all the square footage was a blessing - and a curse. Enter the Eufy. I bought two of these units one for downstairs and one for upstairs. My busy life was back on track with no lengthy house cleaning sessions required. So I thought. Come to find out the ""stair sensor"" is not all it's cracked up to be. My house has two staircases. One is the massive staircase leading downstairs. One is a 3 stair staircase leading to a different room. The big staircase has a hardwood ""strip"" at the top since the stairs are hardwood. Eufy (luckily) has not fallen down those stairs yet. If it did, it wouldn't survive. It would also cause drywall damage on the way down because it's a curved staircase. The smaller staircase is simply ""wrapped carpet"" on the top of the staircase lip. Essentially the carpet simply continues to the stairs with no seam and wraps the entire staircase. Eufy has tumbled down these stairs 3 times in 1 month. I am lucky they are carpeted and that the staircase is only 3 steps or something tells me Eufy would have died. Since this has been a theme I've watched Eufy closely to discern any issues and honestly I think I've discovered what I believe to be a design flaw. The design of Eufy has the dustbin in the back, which means all the circuitry and battery (batteries are heavy) are in the front. This design makes sense considering that Eufy drives straight into the docking station. This means you can pull the dustbin while Eufy is docked and charging. However for staircases it means Eufy is terribly front heavy. For a wrapped carpet staircase it seems the sensor can't quote detect the edge as fast and the front wheel actually starts to roll down the cusp of the carpet before sensing it. Since Eufy is so front heavy once it starts down the cusp you can't reverse it and it falls. To back up this theory I've actually watched Eufy do a ""stoppie"" (nose goes down, butt comes up in the air) and then reverse JUST in time to recover. From observing this I personally believe it wouldn't be an issue if Eufy had more weight in the back than the front. From a design perspective I feel this is easy to achiever because you simply reverse the docking procedure and have it ""back in"" to the docking station and the dustbin can still be exposed for easy emptying. At this point I'm unsure what to do. I want my house to all use the same robot vacuums. You can't exactly attach a boundary strip to a carpet wrapped edge. I could completely refinish those 3 stairs to be wooden also but should I really have to do a home improvement project over a vacuum? I am considering taping a 2.5 lb gym weight to the butt of the Eufy to see if it does indeed resolve the issue, but in a dream home to walk by a ""duct tape"" solution every day kinda sucks IMO. Perhaps I need to return both and try a different brand.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2018"
B07R295MLS,2,Broke after less than 1 year and a few days and no help from manufacturer.,"This is our 5th Eufy and now we're done. First, it's not as good as the old one with 2 edge brushes. And second, after less than a year of usage it just started doing this beeping. I tried all the advice from customer service. Cleaned, reset, etc. It all took me past 1 year and then they said, oops, now you're past a year, too bad so sad, no warranty any more. But we'll let you buy another one with a discount. I looked at the models they offered me and chose one. Nope, we don't have those any more either. But we'll let you buy this crappy used one for what we used to charge for a new one. Deal? Nope.

B07R295MLS,2,"Pretty terrible: if you have to babysit it, might as well just vacuum yourself","We bought this knowing it was a cheaper version but to test out if the cats freaked out or not before investing in a fancy one. This thing just gets stuck in a corner or under a table and repeats same area then gets stuck again. Pretty sad. Had it on for about 10 mins and it covered very little area. When it hits a leg of a table, it seems to spin just enough to hit the other leg of the table, then spins 180 and hits the first leg again. So it was stuck under the table this way a while. Then it got stuck in the corner, spun around just far enough to hit the other wall of the corner. Kind of funny actually. The little duster spinning thing is probably great for animal fur (why we bought it) but it sucked up nothing from our very short pile rug. Cat hissed once then was just following it. I was hoping one day they would ride it but I dont think I’ll even try it again. Pretty worthless. Seems stable. Zero mapping. Couldnt get it to come back to its charger/docking so had to pick it up and put it in front of it. Zero intelligence.

B07R295MLS,2,"Decent 1st RoboVac, but not durable","First off, I'll say that this was my first experience with a Robovac, and it's been better than I had initially expected. (December 2019) That said, it's been about a year and a half since we got ours, and it's had a number of problems. On first activation, the vac is quiet and does a good job. after a few weeks or months however, the sound of the motors gets continually louder. I imagine it's from dust getting inside the machine. About 8 months after owning it, I had to send it in and get a replacement because the bottom roller just got stuck. Another 5 months later, the same thing happened. Only this time, I decided to order the parts myself and replace them. About $30. Now, I'm someone who's built whole computers, I can work with tiny machinery. But if you're not that type of person, I can see manually replacing a motor as being near impossible. It's been a few months since then, and now the front motor on the right has also given out. I suspect this is because we have sliding mirror doors on our closet, and the censor isn't good enough to detect when it gets nearby, so it will bump into it for a few seconds everyday, causing the side brush not to spin. Did I mention that this model doesn't work with magnetic tape or any kind of barriers? No, you'll need to buy a newer version for that feature. The second major issue I have with this vac is a design flaw. On the front bumper, there is a rubber guard at the bottom to keep it from leaving a mark should it bump into furniture. However, there is a hard plastic piece at the top that is not guarded. So this bumper only protects furniture that is straight. To explain what I mean, is that if your chairs have a bevel-style cut, or taper from large to small as they go down, this vac will ABSOLUTELY damage your furniture. Before I noticed, the damage was done to 3 different chairs. I had to buy a bit foam tape to cover this plastic part. Not an ideal fix... But it helps. So in a year and a half, I've basically seen 3 motors burn out, the sound get extremely louder, and my furniture getting damaged. All that is to say, the vac does do it's job when it works. I don't see nearly as much cat hair, cat litter, or random food bits on the ground anymore. There are no dust bunnies gathering under my couch or hard to reach places. I just wish I knew it was in inferior product before I bought it. I highly suggest sticking with Eufy, but looking at a newer model.","Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2021"

They will not replace the replacement. We will not buy another eufy. We have 2 cats and one dog. The brush needs to be cleaned about every 2 vacuum sessions or it will clog the brush & the eufy will stop. I keep the brush very clean and they still stop working randomly.

B07R295MLS,2,Issues after 1 year of use,"We really enjoyed our 11S Slim model. It was quieter than our old roomba, which was a big reason we wanted to purchase a new robot vacuum. For the year we owned it, it did its job picking up dog hair and dirt on our main tile floors not having to hit much carpeted areas of the house. I will say, with long dog hair you had to clean the main brush roller quite frequently to keep it clean and clear. Unfortunately after only 1 year and 2 weeks of ownership it would just stop working after a few minutes of running with the 4 beeps and solid red light. This indicates that the main brush roller was clogged or blocked in some way. I used all the troubleshooting methods recommend to resolve this by Eufy and that I could find online short of taking the vacuum apart which I was not comfortable with. I opened a case with Eufy and I was told, sorry for the inconvenience, but you are out of warranty so here is the link to a buy a replacement brush motor and the instructions to replace it. 2 weeks out of warranty and i have to buy a replacement motor and dissect the thing to try and fix it. Ideally they would have had some sympathy and sent the replacement or at least said sorry, let us send you the replacement brush. Meanwhile I've had my Roomba for 7 years and while it's still noisy... it's still running without issue. I guess it's time to look at the new Roombas for my next robot vacuum which is unfortunate because I do hate leaving bad reviews and wanted to be a good reviewer of the Eufy brand like everyone else.","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2023"
B07R295MLS,2,Dumbest Robot Alive,"It’s super cool as a robot vacuum. It’s decent in the sense that it does a chore while I’m not doing it. Otherwise, this thing is like a robot that was dropped on his head on the product line. It routinely runs into us. Literally like it’s resentful, it takes aim. It will run OVER our toes. Not pleasant and again, it will just divert paths to do this. If we have something like a package propped against a wall, the robot seems to sense that it’s unsteady and will bump into it until it gets knocked over — will bump it 12 to 15 times, easily. If I send it in the direction of my living room, and go into my bedroom to feed the dogs, suddenly it needs to be in the bedroom, in the specific corner I set up their food bowls. Honestly, it’s either dumb or smartly programmed to annoy us equally as much as it cleans up. Other major con: battery life. Our house is incredibly small and we run it five days a week because it lasts no more than 90 minutes — this basically means it completes 500 ish square feet and needs to charge 3 hours to do the other 500. I got this during a prime sale and don’t feel too bad about this purchase but if I had paid full price I would be seething — not worth it for that.","Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2023"

B07R295MLS,2,"Decent vacuum, but...","I hardly ever review things, but I have had so much trouble with this vacuum. When it first arrived, I was very happy with it. Decent suction power and seemingly well-made for the price. Two days in and the vacuum displayed the blinking light and an error beep. I cleared a sock that was stuck in the roller brush and started it again. More error beeping. I cleaned every nook and cranny of the machine and still, it would run for about a minute and a half and begin the error message again. Frustrated, I emailed the company for troubleshooting help. Almost immediately, they replied that the unit must be defective and that they would send me a new one once they received my defective one. I found this frustrating also, because I could have just returned it to Amazon and bought a new one via one-day prime shipping. I told them as much and they expedited shipping of the new unit. Once it arrived, I had no trouble with it for about two months. Then, one morning I woke up to the glass top of it completely shattered (see photo). Nothing had fallen on it, been sat on it...I don’t know if it bumped something when on auto and then returned home without me noticing, but what could it have hit that would have shattered it so badly? When I woke up, it was simply docked on its charger and had been all night. It still ran, but I wasn’t keen for it to sprinkle glass all over my house. Again I emailed the company and again I was told it “wasn’t a common problem” but that they would send me a new machine. Here is where I got suspicious. Not a common problem but you’re willing to replace it sight-unseen immediately? I’m going to end up having three vacuums in as many months. I appreciate their customer service, but I feel like they doubt the quality of their own product if they are so quick and willing to replace it. I was so done with the hassle of it all, I asked if they could just send a new glass top and the adhesive tape (which is all it has holding it on) for me to replace it myself, instead of mailing another entire unit back. Nope! So here I go again, about to send back another vacuum, wait a week for a replacement, and pray nothing else goes wrong with it. For this much money, there shouldn’t be this much hassle.

B07R295MLS,2,I do not recommend this product,"I first bought this product in March 2021. It worked fine for about 2 months. After a few months it would stop in the middle of the floor and beep 3 times, which indicates it is stuck and cannot back up. I did empty the tray and always cleaned the roller between uses. I first called Amazon to report the issue and they connected me to Eufy customer service. I shared my issue and they said it was a defective vacuum and sent me a replacement. It arrived quickly and they sent a prepaid label to return the first one. Round 2 with the vacuum, this second one worked well for about 6 months. I did notice that it didn’t have great suction and would drag large clumps of hair around my home, even after tray dumps and brush cleaning. I do have 2 golden retrievers and I do dry sweep my floors with a broom everyday on top of the Eufy. Last week the vacuum started the exact error sequence, 3 beeps and it stopped. I once again called Eufy customer service and we ran a few trouble shooting ideas but nothing worked so they sent me another (3rd) vacuum. It arrived 3 days ago, my husband put it together and charged overnight. Monday I went to run it and immediately within a few moments it stopped and gave the 3 beep error indicating it was stuck and could not back up. I reset the vacuum and this pattern continued every 1-2 minutes for 10 minutes. It never even made its way out of the living room. I sent an email to Eufy to share this issue and this time asked for a full refund and a label to send it back. They replied to me and said they do not offer refunds, only product swaps until the 1 year warranty expires and then no exchange at all, I would have to buy a new one. I called Amazon and they promptly offered a full refund and allowed me to throw the vac away without returning it. I now plan to buy a different manufacturer robot vacuum and see if I have better luck but definitely would not recommend this Eufy product.","Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2021"
B07R295MLS,2,"Does NOT learn the room, gets stuck on chair feet","I fought with this robot for more than 10 days. I have 2 chairs that rock on a pedestal base with 4 feet. This sweeper will drive up on the feet which lifts its wheels off the floor and get stuck there until I intervene. But then 10 minutes later, it will be right back there and stuck on the feet again. What good is having a robotic sweeper if I have to babysit it? Because I have to babysit it, I don't have it set to run on a schedule when I'm not around -- which was one primary reason I bought it. But I came downstairs one morning and found it with its spinning brushes disconnected and laying on the floor 5 feet away, stuck on one of the chair's feet with a dead battery. Dog hair: ugh. It does a great job of picking up dog hair. But it gets wrapped around its roller and it takes longer to remove the dog hair from the roller than it would take me to sweep the floor with a typical, non-robotic, vacuum cleaner. Where it cleans, it does a really good job. But: 1) it's sweeping pattern seems completely random. It seems like if it runs randomly for long enough that it will cover the entire floor. 2) it gets stuck under furniture and then can take 10 to 15 minutes to find its way out. And then 10 minutes later, when its random pattern brings it back to the same place, it gets stuck again. I just watched it run and get stuck 3 times in the same corner under a small table. 3) I put items across the floor to block it into the room I bought it to clean. It just pushed through and kept on going. I had to pick it up and return it to the room. 4) I bought this to do an automatic clean on a new carpet, daily, overnight. But I cannot trust it to sweep everything and then return to it's charging platform because it's more likely to get stuck in a corner, under the furniture, and run out of charge having accomplished nothing. I don't want to have to stand over it and keep it out of where I don't want it to go -- I might as well sweep the carpet myself. I don't want to spread blocks all over the room to keep it out of places. That will look like crap. It's sweep pattern needs improvement. It needs to map the room so it ""knows"" where it should be sweeping, where it's completed, and what to avoid. It needs a way to be programmed such that I can tell it where not to go. I would not buy this one again. I am returning it. I give it 2 stars because it does clean well, where it's able to clean.","Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2020"

B07R295MLS,2,Eufy fail.,"I rarely write reviews on products, and when I do they’re usually because a product is so great that I must comment on it. Unfortunately that is not the case here. As of today, my Eufy no longer turns on at all. I’ve owned it for about 2.5 months. It’s really just not a great product. Now I had no delusions that this robot vac would deep clean my whole home. My hope was that it would run once a day and keep the dust bunnies and dog hair from building up. In the 2 months I’ve had it, I have to say, it’s hands down the largest waste of money I’ve spent in a while. Pros: it has a remote, so I can control it if I’m home. It also has a timer to run each day wether I’m home or not. I chose a time where there is generally little foot traffic and I would be sure it had freedom to just do it’s thing. It also does an ok job actually vacuuming and sucking up dog hair in the areas that it makes it to. Cons: Where to start... I’ve never owned a robot vac before, and as stated, I wasn’t expecting it to be the only vacuum I’d ever need. Honestly though, the amount of times I have to go locate the vacuum, makes it not worth it. Biggest complaint, because it gets lost and confused so frequently, it never goes “home” after cleaning. It spends so much time trying to reroute itself that it dies while cleaning and then I have to track it down when I get home. If I’m home, and it’s running, chances are I have to find it, reroute it, set it in the middle of a room and then repeat. Then I have to time it to see how long it’s been running and send it home after a certain time so it doesn’t die under a couch. This happens every 3 minutes or so. It also does not follow a pattern whatsoever. I have a very basic floor plan, and a pretty small first floor. All wood floors with one very low pile rug. There are no obstacles in the way of the vacuum and it still doesn’t clean the floor. It misses most corners and generally just does not do well getting even one small room clean. This is not because of its power, but because it just misses large areas repeatedly. Bottom line, if you’re looking for a robot vacuum, probably stick with the well known, tried and true brands. This one was a total waste of money and no response from the manufacturer on this.","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2020"
B07R295MLS,2,I loved it at first,"I am disappointed For the first 6 months I was in love. This is my first robot vacuum and I loved walking in and feeling like I had a maid come through and vacuum for us. Then, for some reason it stared getting stuck underneath my couch when it never did that before. I ended up blocking the 2 entrances for it and it stopped for about a month. Then it found another spot of the couch that it could shove itself under. I put a bunch of black towels under my couch to prevent it from doing it again but the aesthetic is so wrong now. And it REALLY wedges itself in there, which makes no sense to me because it barely allows itself to go along the corners of the wall. I bought it May 2021 and now Jan 2022 I’m pretty annoyed with it, very disappointing as I really expected it to last much longer than 6 months(when I started having issues. And I followed all of the directions. Clean it with a damp paper towel every other day, empty it out nightly, and deep clean monthly. I go with my Dyson every Sunday to pick up what’s left, and each month it’s more and more like the Eufy didn’t even do anything that week. I tried changing out the parts that were included and that really did nothing.Now I'm turning it on a second time (it auto cleans at 10am and I make it clean again at 10pm) and really it still makes no difference. It used to leave vacuum lines on the carpet, and now it’s like it didn’t vacuum the house. And mind you, it only vacuums my small living room and kitchen floor. In my opinion, it was a waste of money. It doesn’t live up to the expectations of when I first got it.

Went back to get a second one (for second floor) but discovered that the very newest model only has 1 cleaning brush. Tried it and the newer one picks up less cat fur and debris/dust and it takes a longer time to do so. The manufacturer told me that the reason they removed the 2nd brush was for customer savings and convenience. Not true! You need the cleaning action of the second brush, and yes, if you have hair/fur or dust/dirt, you will have to occasionally clean the brushes (pull off debris). It's easy to do this, and the vacuum comes with a snap on replacement brush. Also, the manufactor gave me a story about ""using R&D"" to make the new (single brush) work better/go faster. Not true - the single brush works no differently from the brushes on the older model. You just get one less cleaning brush on this newer model. This was not mentioned on Amazon. I will buy a third one now and hope to get the slighter older model I bought three weeks ago (they are all labeled and marketed under the same model number). And return the single brush one(s). It's wrong to make a major change to the model, then call it the same model number, then give a b s ""r&d"" explanation to the customer.

B07R295MLS,2,Great vacuum but has critical engineering flaws (now useless),"I bought this vacuum in December of 2018. My wife and I instantly loved it and couldn't believe we were without a robot vacuum for so long. It really does a great job of keeping our hardwood floors free of dirt and dog hair from my two dogs (if you do your part in cleaning the dog hair from the brush). However, there are two significant issues that we've come across. The first issue is when the robot encounters a surface level change that is abrupt and not tall enough to trigger the robot's sensors. In my house there are two spots like this: the stone laid in front of the fireplace creates a junction between the hardwood floor that is less than 1"" tall. The second is between the hardwood floor and the tile in the bathroom. There the tile is 3/4 inch higher than the floor. Unfortunately there is not much I can do to fix these spots in the house. The problem is that since the sensor is not triggered by the lip of the stone or tile, the vacuum relentlessly attempts to climb while the brush is spinning against the stone or tile. I have watched it attempt to climb for a LONG time before deciding it can't be done. This leads to the biggest issue, which is where the end of the brush inserts into the spinning mechanism of the vacuum. Both of these mating surfaces are plastic. This is a major weak point in its design because you have a powerful electric motor spinning a brush at high RPM -all connected by soft plastic. If the vacuum picks up a sock or attempts to climb up a surface for a minute it can easily burn this connection out. I've been through 4-5 brushes (which adds up $$$), as the end of these seem softer than the plastic drive they are inserted into. However, there's a point where this drive thing just plain wears out and the square mating surface is stripped and rounded. It's at this point where the vacuum can't turn a brush anymore and is useless. This is very frustrating because there is no way for me to fix or replace this weak part. This is now the second vacuum with this same issue. The first one was replaced by Eufy under warranty. I've added pictures of the worn out brush and the drive insertion point.

I reached out to customer service and they had the nerve to ask for a bunch of information just to simply say that it was a battery issue when google would give that answer in a few seconds. Heads up when charging if the light flashes red and beeps 5 times, its a battery issue.

B07R295MLS,2,Buyer's Remorse,"For the longest time my wife has wanted one of these robo-vacs. When you think about them it seems practical and that it would make life easier. Well, from my experience, you are mistaken. It's probably easier to list my grievances with this device that write a paragraph. 1. You have to prep for this thing to vacuum or it's going to miss spots. Our biggest collection of dirt is under where our kids eat. Because the vac's direction is random it usually won't find it's way between the chair legs. Thus it misses the most important area unless we move the chairs. 2. Along with the prep anything small on the ground will most likely cause an issue. It's gotten stuck on our kitchen mats, our door mats, and random other things on the ground. You either have to remove things from your floor every time or completely rearrange your house to fit the purpose of the vac. 3. Like I said before the path of the vac seems random. It hit's something and then appears to turn an arbitrary degree. It usually runs out of battery before it randomly hits every part of the floor. So you have to go back and vacuum after the vacuum...lol. 4. It might run quiet, but it bumps loudly. We live in an apartment and wanted it to run at night so the kids wouldn't mess with it as it ran. It slammed into our door and woke us in the middle of the night. That was a nice bit of panic before we figured out it was the vacuum. That ended the night runs. 5. Hair gets tangled in the sweeper brushes. 6. The suction isn't what I had hoped. You see a number ""1300Pa"" and you think ""sure, that sounds good"", but I've seen it run over a dried out piece of rice and not pick it up. I wish I had ponied up for one that you can map out your room to get a bit smarter of a cleaning and avoid areas.","Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2019"
B07R295MLS,2,"Good, could be a whole lot better","I have 100% hard floors with some area rugs that are well secured in a home with no stairs or ledges so I thought this would work perfectly and I could reduce use of my regular vacuum. I was wrong. After almost a year with this model, this is all I’ve learned... It takes just as much time and energy as using my regular vacuum because I have to rescue it off of so many pieces of my furniture every time I run it. It gets caught on the bases of my coffee table and dining chairs every time and it never learns. It moves nonsensically, misses places that are easy to get to but then I will find it wedged in some random place and I’m baffled by how it got there. It has helped hone my echolocation skills though, since when it can’t get back out of those places it does the robot version of crying for help, ie incessant beeping. The size of the intake does not match the width of the bin so bin capacity is irrelevant, it just backs up near the intake and clogs it after about 4 clumps of pet hair. Cleaning the brush roller... a task best left to someone with more time and patience. The good: It makes a great assistant when you’re short on time and hands trying to get ready for company. It does a pretty good job with basic maintenance vacuuming. It cleans under my furniture where my regular vacuum can’t go so it cuts down on random pet hair and dust floating around. It does manage to hit most places. If you do accidentally leave a cord down, it’s not powerful enough to damage it significantly and it will auto-shut off pretty quickly if the cord is wrapped in the sweeper. The battery life is long enough to comfortably clean about 600-700 sq ft in one charge, but this could easily be more if the thing moved with any sense of efficiency at all. All in all, spent a lot of money for a fancy broom but it pays off when I’m in a bind getting ready for guests, so I still appreciate having it. Would still get a robo vac but not this one if I did it all over again.","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2019"

B07R295MLS,2,Not worth it.,"I have wanted a robot vacuum for a very long time. So when I saw this one for $229 I jumped at the offer. It has great reviews, it looks nice, and its not going to break the bank. Unfortunately, after the unboxing and getting it set up I decided to let it do its thing and I turned it on. From what I can tell there are no underlying systems that it utilizes to operate. It simply has a bumper on the front and runs itself into things until it find a wall to go against, occasionally darting in the opposite direction after a few seconds. I've read from other comments that compared to many of these types of vacuums it has good suction, unfortunately it spend 99% of the time I use either vacuuming the exact same spots over and over again or it gets stuck on my wife's computer desk leg and just cycles on top of it since it cant reach the leg to bump itself and try a different direction. Its great that it has superior suction ability to most of the other vacuums it would just be nice for it to use it on something other than the exact same two spots it somehow inevitably finds its way into. I've gone back to a manual vacuum and now have a very cool looking useless robot that hangs out on my floor. The one area I agree with many others on and would rate it highly is, its a great distraction for my dog, he loves to just follow it around until it gets stuck then he just barks at it.","Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2022"
B07R295MLS,2,"If you want to babysit your vacuum, buy this one","I would attach a video, but apparently Amazon doesn't support the format (MOV from my iphone). In any case, in the past few weeks I have tried both the Shark robotic vacuum and this one. Pros: This vacuum gets much closer to the edges, which is absolutely wonderful. It even has a setting for just edges. It seems to move more rapidly across the floor, so even though it runs less time than the Shark it still covers just as much ground. Cons: My daughter has the EXACT same vacuum she purchased a week ago, runs fine in my house. This little monster tried to destroy my rug in three places and got stuck four times that my daughter's vacuum did not (in 20 minutes). I'm not sure how Eufy can explain this. No strips to avoid problem areas. So, if you aren't babysitting because it goes over your rug in one spot 40 times trying to make it up (medium pile rug), then you have to babysit because it heads under the recliner. Remote instead of an app. The Shark robot has an app, and while it disconnected from wifi twice, it also had a schedule and I could start it anytime. I would also add that if my Shark got stuck, if I shut it off and turned it back on it seemed to get smarter about how to get out of that situation. Not the Eufy, stays dumb and just keeps trying the same thing over and over again. My daughter is at home now with a new baby, and doesn't have a rug so she likes this vacuum better and returned the Shark. I work outside the home, and I need a vacuum that doesn't require me to watch it at all times. I guess it depends on your home and if you have carpets or rugs on wood floors (or no rugs, like my daughter). I'm sure it would be fine if there wasn't a area rug. Unfortunately my Shark already started making a noise, so I am hoping I got a lemon because I'm sending this back and getting another Shark.","Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2019"

(She does such a good job that I’ve anthropomorphized her to a gender, and I think that kind of thing if stupid.). I have 2 short haired dogs I don’t groom often enough and live in a sand pile. And I hate to vacuum. With Eufy, my floors are spotless at all times. She picks up so much stuff that I need to empty her out at least every other day, which is really easy. Much easier than getting out the big vacuum. It makes me cringe to think about how dirty my house used to be. A robovac will not completely substitute for regular vacuuming with a conventional human run machine, but is definitely much better than almost never vacuuming. This very thin machine can get under all but a few pieces of furniture. I have her on a timer and she merrily runs around the house each day while I’m at work. She’s quiet enough that I can easily talk on the phone if I’m home when she’s cleaning.. I am very noise sensitive and it doesn’t bother me .

I’m going to buy a new brand from Costco, so when it breaks I can take it back. Further update- I bought a shark IQ model, so I have a comparison- the eufy model is much quieter- if you vacuum while you are at home, might be worth tolerating the short lifespan of a eufy. The shark is annoyingly loud, but it does have a stronger motor, so it cleans much better than the eufy","Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2019"
B07R295MLS,2,Not a vacuum alternative. Ended up returning after 2 weeks sadly.,"I was so sad that I had to return ‘Ralph’, our Euphy 11S! Our home is 1,100 sq ft and is about 70% medium like carpet and 30% LVP (Luxury Vinyl Plank by LifeProof). I bought this because the description said it does well on medium pile carpet, which I did not find to be the case. I have 2 Australian Shepherds that shed a lot. Here are the pros and the cons of the product from my experience: PROS 1. It looks nice and sleek 2. It’s easy to empty the pan 3. Leaves nice lines on carpet 4. Great at finding its way back to its charging station 5. One battery charge was enough for it to completely go around my 1,100 sqft home several times. CONS 1. Does not connect to internet so there is no smart mapping or scheduling capabilities with it 2. Constantly pulling out plugs from the wall and pulling things off of counters due to sucking up the wires. It takes WAY too long to turn off once it has devoured your cords. 3. Doesn’t ‘learn’ areas that it shouldn’t go over time. Ours kept going into the same area of the kitchen and getting stuck in the same area under the table . 4. The pieces they give you to go on the bottom that swivel around are basically useless if you have anything more than a low firm pile carpet. It’s clearly made for hardwoods. 5. Even with it cleaning the whole house 3 times I day I still found that in regards to the carpeted area (70% of my home) that I needed to vacuum every other day still. When I did my Shark vacuum pulled up SO much hair and dust that the Eufy just wasn’t able to. 6. Quiet but weak motor means it isn’t able to pull up dust or embedded pet hair. It’s very much for surface level cleaning. Overall, if your home is mostly hardwoods and you have some low pile carpets this could be great for you. If you have allergies to dust or pet hair you need removed then I would not recommend. If you have exposed chords or stairs I would not recommend since there are no mapping capabilities with this model. I ended up returning mine after 2 weeks for a full refund from amazon. I’ll just stick to the 10 minutes it takes me to vacuum each night.","Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2019"
B07R295MLS,2,"""Robot"" Vacuum =/= AI Vacuum .. no clue why this has so many good reviews.","First off, if you have shag rugs, don't get this. Done. It gets two stars because there are so many little niceties with it (cleaning brushes, extra brush, instructions written on device, remote holder on charger, etc.). Also, it sure can pick up all that stuff on your floor... if it's small. But it will need assistance every time it tries to do anything. But it doesn't matter how much it can suck if it takes 2 hours to figure out the other half of the room exists! I don't even think this thing knows what a straight line is. I was under the impression it would map out the house slightly as it has ""edge clean"" and ""find home"" features. Or, at the very least, avoid bumping into everything and trying to go downstairs (yeah that feature is a hit or miss...). How does it find it's base station? the same way it cleans. Completely going in random directions until it sees what I presume is a infrared light emitted by the base station and docks itself. How does it clean under chairs? By you hand holding it. It'll get stuck, if not avoid attempting in the first place. I was amazed it actually made it past my office chair once. There's no AI. No mapping. It doesn't know the difference between a wall, a chair, or your foot (owe).

B07R295MLS,2,Savings Not Worth the Hassle,"My family has had a robot vaccum for about 5 years. Our first two vaccums were basic Deebots. They lasted about 2 years apiece with regular cleaning and occasional maintenance which I found acceptable for the price (we have three dogs, so we use the robot vaccums a lot). We tossed our last Deebot in May 2023 and when it came time to buy another one, the price on the same model had increased. Times are tough so I thought it would be more sensible to buy a slightly cheaper robot. Enter the Eufy, and an endless headache. First of all, this thing is much more difficult to clean. Maybe it wouldn't be as big of a deal if you don't have pets, but it's a problem for us. I could live with that inconvenience though if it performed well. Unfortunately, six months after getting this vaccum it's started experiencing motor issues. Every time we run it, it's LOUD. Eufy customer support is okay so far, a little frustrating (AI responses asking for info already sent) but realistically we shouldn't be dealing with a major issue six months after buying these. We will never buy a Eufy product again.","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2023"
B07R295MLS,2,Lacking the SMART in smart vacuum,"Gave this vacuum a full month trial run. First couple times, it would get caught up on the circular base of my swivel chairs in the living room. Another time it got stuck on a ridge under a table. Another time on some carpet fringe. Another time under my couch. And another time on a door threshold. It seems the vacuum doesn't have a good gauge of what it can or can't do. Instead of displaying logic to help it know when to not try to overcome an obstacle, instead it would try and then get stuck. Or when it went under the couch and met resistance - instead of backing out, it pushed further under, getting itself stuck. Every morning, after it ran overnight, I'd find a half-completed job and it stuck somewhere. Pros: - good at finding its way home - incredibly quiet - sleek and very goodlooking - doghair never got tangled in brushes Cons: - never successfully completed a job without getting stuck Ultimate, I returned it. The point of a robovac is to not have to hands on deal with the vacuuming, which this did not help me do.","Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2023"
B07R295MLS,2,"Quiet, slim and so so so so dumb","To be fair my first bots were the Neato D-bots and the Roomba iRobot brands. They cost more than this little bot but they were so much better.

It does look good and has a really affordable price. The bad No wifi No app Very limited scheduling options It does not ever clean a whole room. It will clean the same areas over and over and over and over and over again. I gets stuck in the same spots daily if I do not blocks it path with objects. It has no avoidance mechanisms like the better brands. I basically bumbles about until the batteries get low and then it goes to the charger until the next time. Even with the brushes it cannot get corners. My floors are hardwood and it does only fairly on it. The biggest issue is that the AI. I does not seem to exist. Tangent! The Neato bots would start out dumb but get smarter over time. This one does not. I am sure this bot fell off of the short bus and never made it back to school. It is cheap. and truly proof that you get what you pay for. Note , I did get this bot 8 months worth of daily running to give it a fair shot. If the makers could improve the AI then this would be a decent entry bot. Especially for an apartment or small home. BUT, and read my other reviews, I rarely give a bad review.

The brushes fall off on rugs too. It also has to return to base for charging Before it ever cleans the house fully. It never cleaned by my front or back door. Left other areas unclean .

B07R295MLS,2,Died after one year,"I bought this just a few days over a year ago, and I ran it MOST days. It did a good job, overall. Great for keeping pet hair from pooling under furniture although any hair bound up on the roller brush so it was necessary to cut that off literally every use. Especially around the axles. Today I heard it making loud noise like the roller was slipping in the holder. Sure enough, the roller was not turning. I removed it and the sound stopped. Fortunately, I had purchased an extended warranty so Amazon immediately refunded my purchase price . I would have been ok with a repair, but I think I will just save up for a better quality robotic vacuum as I really liked it. I bought two of these but the second one is not used every day, so it may take a little while longer for it to fail, but it probably will. FYI: I put some stick tape around the small side of the roller brush (where the axle turn originates) and it is working for now, so I might get a few more days or even weeks out of until while I search for a replacement.

This is my 3rd robot vacuum since it has been a thing and I was trying to ball on a budget. You definitely get what you pay for this one. I really thought by the reviews it would be halfway decent. Where do I begin? It can’t find it’s charging port, and if it gets stuck under something (which happens all of the time) it’ll stay under there until you go grab it. It likes to roam under my bed and just die under there for no apparent reason. So I always have to climb under my bed to retrieve it. It’ll keep bumping into the same object 15 times until I come get it. It’s not even stuck, just decided to bump into the same wall over and over. I feel ya vacuum, I like to bang my head on the wall too sometimes. I’m only giving it 2 stars because it does a decent job picking up hair when I clean out the port. But about 20% of that hair isn’t picked up and rather just pushed into a pile. Very odd and I’ve never had a robot vacuum do that. No biggie I just pick up the collection of hair with my hand because the vacuum quite literally rolls it into a ball for me. Anyways, spend the extra money and get something worth it.

B07R295MLS,2,Not efficient,"I bought our model in Nov. 2018 so it could be different than this one. However, it worked great for about 3 months. The biggest problem is that it started just going over the same areas time and time again. I closed off the kitchen and let it go and it literally took the same path for almost 30 minutes, leaving many places unvacuumed. We quit using it because it was so ineffective. I recently got it out again and put on new brushes, etc. It can go over the smallest thing (like a cracker crumb) and just spit it out. I checked to see if the cup was full, which it shouldn't have been as it had only been running a mere 15 minutes. It also still just goes over the same areas again and again, missing other areas completely and also not picking up some stuff it comes across. I have made sure it is clean and that it has new brushes but it doesn't seem to matter. Very disappointing and has made me hesitant to order another robo vac of any brand. I'd love to have one as it would save so much time to come home to clean floors. It's just me and my husband and now we have a dog, but we are all 3 outside of the house at work all day (the dog goes to work with my husband), so it should be able to operate better than it does.

B07R295MLS,2,Initial Impression - Not Impressed,"I received the vacuum yesterday and immediately charged it up and put it to work. I set it to vacuum my downstairs on Auto which includes my kitchen and living room by pressing the Start/Stop button on the remote. The flooring is hardwood and travertine with a couple of area rugs. I thought the vacuum would have some sort of logical process to cover every square inch of the floor but it just bounced around with no real method to its madness. It went from one room to the next and back again covering random areas bouncing to and fro. The most frustrating part was that the spinning brushes kept coming off. In a 30 min run I had to put them back on 4 times. Various things caused the brushes to come off such as the area rug or moulding. I initially thought that the spinning brush was getting pinched between the bottom of the moulding and the flooring or flooring transition pieces but when I removed the brush there was absolutely no resistance or evidence that it had been pinched. Funny thing is that I have tried to pull the spinning brush off the machine but can't - I'll admit that I don't want to force so hard that I break it. So a little disappointed that this machine isn't quite ""fire and forget"". Lastly this morning it ran low on battery so shifted to low battery mode where the power button turns orange and the vacuum slows down and no longer vacuums. I though it would return to the charging base but it just continued it's haphazard maneuvering around my kitchen as if it were still cleaning. I had to ""drive"" it back to its base to charge it as the home button on the remote failed to force it to return. I'll keep using it and hopefully it's performance improves or I figure out the programming as part of the problem could very likely be me.","Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2020"

B07R295MLS,2,"Random patterns, baby sitting, so-so cleaning ability.","I have now had this vacuum for just over a year. Aside from regularly having to clean it, replace the brushes, and filters, it's still functioning and has a decent battery life left. I live in a small, single story home, with wood and tiles floors, with a few area rugs throughout. I have a couple high thresholds between rooms, but otherwise my house seems primed for use with a product like this. At this point, after a year, I would absolutely not recommend buying a robot vacuum that doesn't support mapping and boundaries. This vacuum, and a lot of the cheaper ones, tend to run in random patterns until they hit and obstacle, turn and go on again until they hit an obstacle. At first, it seems like that works relatively fine. I cannot count the times I've seen this thing get stuck trying to ride up a coat rack with a rounded base, and instead of turning around it just goes forward and back, and forward and back, never triggering an error. I've rearranged some furniture to keep the vacuum from getting tangled up in some cords where my internet modem is plugged in. This thing manages to find a way in there regardless. I discovered the other day that it some how got caught in a microfiber bath mat in my bathroom, and am still absolutely bewildered because it's a low pile carpet. Like there's nothing to get caught on, but this thing managed too. This thing supports schedules for automated cleaning, but unfortunately due to the nature of it constantly getting caught in things, getting trapped, and generally getting stuck, I cannot leave this thing on it's own. I have to be diligent and baby sit this thing to have it clean. Frankly it defeats the purpose of an automated tool like this. I'd rather but out the old Oreck and run through my entire house in 20 mins and know it's clean than worry about this thing. The suction power is okay, it does actually clean the floors when it works, but like mentioned above, I don't think it's worth the frustration of baby sitting a robot.","Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2020"

I was excited to try them out since we are both OCD when it comes to clean floors and both have mostly smooth, hard floors (hers are tile and mine are wood). I followed the instructions and after charging was excited to see what it would do. I tried mine out first and had faith based on reviews that even though it followed a random cleaning pattern it would get the job done. It hits some areas multiple times while it completely misses certain spots. It will be cleaning an area then suddenly change direction midway to miss the rest of the room. It can twirl around in one section as if its caught in a box then eventually manages to leave the section but much time and battery wasted - the brushes can send dirt flying instead of caching it. I tried using the remote to steer it into the areas it misses but after a few commands it stopped responding to the remote. It seems when it heads to the dock it will go the longest way possible around the house even if it’s only 10 feet from the dock. It definitely vacuums well, picking up a lot of dust & trash but what’s the use of it misses more spots than my 20 year old sweeping? Same experiences with my girlfriend’s house.

It constantly gets stuck on the base of a large cat scratcher regardless of where I put it in our space--like it seeks the thing out. It's constantly getting stuck under our sectional against one leg, even though it has plenty of clearance otherwise and could turn or back up. When it's running, I have to follow it around half the time to get it unstuck, to block it, to turn it around and put it into the kitchen. This happens even when I chose the solo room setting. I swear it sees a mess, like cat litter around the litter box, and turns before it sweeps that up. It shipwrecks itself in corners and beeps incessantly. The filter is constantly getting clogged and it's REALLY noisy. If I didn't have to constantly supervise it, I'd put up with those things. It does a really good job with picking up cat hair. It's easy to clean, and I like that the beater brush comes out. But the front wheel gathers hair and grime and you can't take that out to clean it. Maybe I got a possessed model. Regardless, I'm returning this and just buying a more expensive model that makes a map and can be controlled via Bluetooth.","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2022"
B07R295MLS,2,"Loved Original 11S Slim, Not This One","My Eufy 11S Slim died after about 6 years. That worked really well for me as I loved the low profile and it's ability to get under almost all of my furniture (I didn't need all the mapping bells and whistles). So I figured I'd repeat with a slight upgrade to 11s MAX. Unfortunately Ive now been through 2 of them and the Boost IQ feature simply doesn't work. An hour spent with Eufy customer service resetting, etc. provided no solution. I'm also not quite convinced of the ""upgrade"" in removing one side brush, but can't say I properly tested that out given the broken boost. It's a bummer but I'll have toook elsewhere for my next robot vac.","Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,It is okay. Needs supervision.,"Initially when we got it for our house, I was jazzed. I used to set it to start up daily at the same time. But the issue is you have to watch the vacuum in case it eats your wires or it gets stuck. It's not the smartest. And it has broken one of our floor mirrors. I like the ability to schedule vacuuming but I wish I could schedule it weekly or every other day instead of daily. When I turn it on, I have to watch it or clean with it. It's kinda nice but it's not why I wanted a robot vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,Not meeting the expectations,"My Eufy 30C is on its 4th year and about to need 3rd battery - very happy with this little hard worker. During Black Friday craze decided to ‘upgrade’ to current Eufy model. Review and comparison on the Internet suggested this 11th model as better vacuum than 30C… Boy, was I disappointed: 11S MAX has single brush, no WiFi - no App, no weekday scheduling (you can program it to run every day from the remote - I run mine twice a week), no magnetic sensors, it’s filter is more basic compare to 3-stage on my old good 30C. I ran 11S MAX once; it worked for ~100 minutes before recharge, but collected less dust than my old vac. Sorry Eufy, new model went back next day. Why go back and make featureless models? - I was expecting WiFi/App, magnetic barrier, scheduling as basic/given, and dual brush too… I am going to replace the battery again, and side brush gears that started skipping on one side - and keep the old model as long as I can. It meets my needs.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023"
B07R295MLS,2,Works great during the 30 day guarentee! Then starts failing leaving you hosed.,"Preface: I learned a lot of do's and dont's after owning an iRobot vacuum. As a result I maintained this robovac like a boss. Cleaned all the moving parts twice a week, removed hair from roller daily, and emptied the bin on it at least once a week if not more frequently. This vacuum worked great for about a month (oddly enough coincides perfectly with shirking their obligation to uphold their guarantee, just makes ya go hmmm) after which it started making weird, unidentifiable noises. I now spend more time in a week maintaining this robot vacuum than I would if I just swept the floors myself once a week. I would recommend NOT using this particular Robovac brand. You get what you pay for and this thing was so feature lacking it was basically just push a button and it does its thing, until it doesn't anymore and starts making ridiculous amounts of noise, requiring you to replace the brush at least every month at $30 dollars a pop. SO IN CLOSING, If you would like to spend just as much time maintaining this product as you would simply just sweeping your own floors, and you are OK with the 30 dollar monthly service fee that is the roller brush, then go for it! This is a great product for your foolish needs, otherwise save yourself the hassle and do it yourself or get a robot worth having, as this is not the one. UPDATE: Now at 3 months of ownership. The unit has now shed the stabilizer wheel. Upon inspection something wore the attachment down to a nub. This thing is absolute trash. I literally hate seeing this thing everyday because I am so disappointed in myself for buying this product. Save yourself the mental anguish.","Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2021"

B07R295MLS,2,Not impressed,"I bought this eufy to replace a Roomba e6 in a carpeted bedroom that finally gave up after years of service. I really wanted to love eufy. It is handsome and I like the remote control and suction options. However, when it comes to performance, I am disappointed. This eufy get stuck under all low furniture and I had to set up blockades everywhere. Even with items blocking obstacles in place, it keeps trying to wedge itself. Very annoying!! This vacuum also loves cords. This unit gets tangled on every single cord and finds cords you didn'trealize you had! My old Roomba never had a problem, but eufy snags every time. For cleaning, dog hair does not make it into the dust bin; it all gets wrapped around the brush. This makes emptying the bin cumbersome. Finally, the navigation algorithm is terrible. It gets lost under the bed despite the sides being wide open. It is determined to go out of the foot side that is blocked, but it just doesn't get the message to try another way. In summary, like everything else in life, you get what you pay for. It was cheaper than everything else, and now I know why.","Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2023"
B07R295MLS,2,Disappointed,"We used to have a different version of this Eufy product. It had two spinning brushes on it, connected to the Wifi, vacuumed our house once a day, and hardly ever needed our attention. We LOVED IT! Then we got a puppy and unfortunately had a potty training accident. We ended up needing to replace our Eufy. We couldn't find the version we already had, so we settled on this one. Well it's been disappointing for sure. It only has one spinner brush which makes a huge difference in clean up. It gets stuck all the time. Every time we run the vacuum, it requires our attention in some way. And lastly, It doesn't connect to the wifi like the other one did, so don't forget to turn it off before going out of town otherwise you'll come home to the Eufy stuck somewhere in the house.","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,Just get a regular vacuum tbh,"I've had this for a little over a year now. I have two cats, carpet and lamenate floor, and a relatively small apartment. Pros: -hands free cleaning; I like being able to press a button on the remote and send the little sucker on it's way to go vacuum -has a timer function so it will vacuum even when you're not there -easy to clean the vacuum itself Cons: -it started quiet but a few months into owning this it got loud. I regularily clean it so idk what the deal is with that -it misses large patches of rooms when left to do it's own thing before returning to it's charging station -it really doesn't pick up much at all. Idk if it's a matter of suction or just area of the actual vacuum part but it just does not do a good job, at least not compared to a normal upright vacuum. -gets stuck around chairs and things very easily if there's too much nearby. Really likes to try eating my sandals lol Overall, I would say you're better off getting a regular vacuum if this is going to be your go-to. I've attached a picture of my new vacuum after a single sweep through my living room-that's all the stuff this little robo vacuum missed over the last year 😬 This might be a good option for touch ups, or if you don't have the ability/time to use a regular upright vacuum everytime you need to clean, but for regular vacuuming needs I would not get this again.","Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2021"

B07R295MLS,2,You get what you pay for,"It's no Roomba. More like the Roomba's idiot cousin. I bought this because my home is relatively uncluttered with no carpet or area rugs. I thought a Roomba would be overkill. But on its first outing, it repeatedly attempted to mount the 1/4 rubber curb on a pet's food mat - ultimately succeeding and humping a water bowl until it had sucked up about a cup of water. On the second outing, with pet-mat and water bowl out of harms way, it promptly wedged itself under a bookcase. After being nudged free, it returned and wedged itself in the exact same spot. The idiot-vac distinguished itself on its next outing by dragging a doormat to the middle of the house, sparking a tense standoff with the cat. Believe the manual when it says the vac can't deal with power cords. When it encounters a cord, it will continue ramming it until it either gets entangled or high-centered. Retreat is not an option. As a vacuum, it does ok. It tends to go over areas it has vacuumed repeatedly while other areas are steadfastly ignored. Maybe it will get around to them eventually. Maybe. Given it's boneheaded stubbornness and lack of self-preservation instinct, I'm thinking of using it as the foundation for a BattleBot.","Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2022"

I understand there is always cleaning involved but I'm doing it after every time it finishes vacuuming. As well as the debris compartment because it is also small. It's meant for one vaccumm cycle. 2. Sense there is no app or smart device to this that tells the vacuum where to go it basically just goes randomly through the house. It gets stuck on every little obstacle is faces. Example: computer chair, under a couch. It seems to never go to the rooms. Just stays mainly in the hallway and living room unless I guide it that way. 3. The noise is not quiet. Our other Dyson portable vacuum is just as loud as it.

We got the new one because the light on the old one had turned red while docked and periodically would not run, as scheduled--we think the battery is dying. We liked it well enough so we got the same thing, but the new one has not impressed. It will not go over the transitions between our vinyl flooring and tile, causing it to get stuck every night! Also, the bump sensor on it is way less sensitive. It just bulldozes over stuff. We have a small potty in the living room for our toddler. The old vac would sense it and avoid it, often before even touching it; the new one just bangs into it and pushes it around. Similarly, the old one would not run over your feet, but the new one just rolled right over my foot, which is funny since it wouldn't roll over the floor transition. I am returning it because it getting stuck every night is a deal breaker. It did vacuum fairly well.","Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2022"

Unfortunately my 11 plus ran over some doggie doo, and I just decide it would be better to order a new one, than to clean the machine from this mess...Let's talk about how much I LOVED my 11 plus, OMG she was the best thing since sliced bread. I have 3 dogs and a soccer player LOL. This little machine ran 2x a day in my house, and my floors (all hard) were spotless! It never even missed 1 hair! It was a quiet a mouse! She would run into things occasionally and my hubby wished she was smarter BUT he was not the head vacuumer in this house, so he didn't need to worry about it! LOL I was heart broken when she ran over the poo.... not her fault though! So I decided to order a new one and of course they don't make my model anymore. Call Eufy, great guy, tells me amazon is having a deal on the 11S Max, I should scoop it up bc it had more power than my old one! I'm thinking PHEW I can't live without it! So now comes the disappointment, this ""better one"" doesn't get all the stuff off the ground even in MAX power mode, and it's CRAZY loud.... So I call Eufy thinking maybe I have a dud bc my last one was AHMAZING, and really they had no answers except saying well it's just not meeting your expectations.... seriously???

In fact, I've been trying to run it over the same tiny piece of kitty litter on my hardwood floor and it has fully gone over it 7 times and yet the kitty litter has moved bc of the brush but has not been sucked up in any of those passes!

B07R295MLS,2,If you actually expect performance- forget it.,"I have used roomba for years. I have 6 small terriers, so my appliances are put to the test daily, and my average “life span” for my roomba is about 4 years. Instead of dropping 400-ish Dollars on another roomba, I figured I’d give this guy a go . Better price point and good reviews . I also was attracted to the slim design - which I always felt was a hindrance to roomba. I do regular “vacuuming “ 2x a week-but I do like my robots for daily maintenance (again 6 small terriers =always something needs vacuuming). The eufy would have constant errors when operating- typically 5-10 mins into the job. The errors were confusing to understand (if you’re used to roomba, you will find this horribly annoying). The error codes aren’t completely clear and even after troubleshooting every possible “condition”, it would always fall back into error after 5-10 mins into a job. I actually had to baby sit this machine and that defeated the whole point. After 2 weeks of ownership, I gave up, bought a lower end roomba, and it’s been , per typical my experience, excellent. Great job, very few errors and when there is an error my phone or the device itself makes it very clear. Pros of the eufy: - slim design - excellent price point - dual brushes Cons: - excessive errors when operating to the point it makes no sense to operate - confusing error codes If you use your robot daily and actually expect performance, this is not the robot for you. If you have a low traffic home , where you’re looking for touch up sweeping - this may be effective.

B07R295MLS,2,"Really quiet when I first got it, then problems started.","I have had this vacuum for almost 2 years. It still works, but about 2 months after getting it, it began making a grinding/rattling noise. It was quite loud compared to the its normal operation which was very quiet. After looking through the support forums I discovered that it is the little square side of the primary brush and putting a small piece of folded tinfoil stopped the rattle/vibration. Replacing the piece of foil regularly and very regular cleaning to get the hair out, the vacuum operated pretty well for just under a year. Then the right side brush started making this grinding sound whenever it was put under the strain of sweeping around the edges. It sounds and is a worn gear in the side motor assembly and as the days went on with it grinding the gear (an obnoxious sound by the way) the right side brush now only turns when on wide open floor and if even a hint of pressure against an object it doesn't spin and you hear the gear. The part itself has got to be pretty inexpensive, but you cannot find it and I am pretty sure Eufy won't sell you one. People have taken to making their own with 3d printers, but as I don't have access to a 3d printer, well......Maybe I can pick up the whole side motor with gears and housing but so far no luck. It is either continue living with 'the grind' and the vacuums inability to sweep around the edges or buy a new vacuum. If you opt to buy one of these, I would spend the 25 dollars for the 2 year no worry guarantee or even longer if available because you will likely have problems.","Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2020"
B07R295MLS,1,"Update: has broken twice in less than 2 years, avoid at all costs","UPDATE: Long-term review. I've had this for almost 2 years. It has completely broken twice now. The first time, the vendor replaced it with a new one after the original unit began making way too much noise to use it daily. After a year, my second unit has now broken, with one of the motors going out. Now my 11s Max just goes in circles and can't even go over a rug any more. Naturally, it died right after I stocked back up on replacement parts. Avoid the 11s Max at all costs. My expectations were too high. I was going from an old robovac that had put in 7 years of hard work and lived through a battery replacement and hundreds of filters, not to mention brush upgrades and firmware updates. It finally died when a laser failed that I couldn't replace. I imagined that after that many years, the entry-level vacuum products may have caught up with an ancient Neato, but that's not the case at all. The brush is TINY. There is a very small width where suction actually occurs. That, combined with the lack of any laser guidance or ""smarts"" means that this thing takes way longer to vacuum than you'd think. It might bounce around in my tiny kitchen for 10 minutes, then find its way back to master bedroom for an hour, then end up back in the kitchen where the battery will go low and it will take 10 minutes to find its way back to the charging station, bumping into every single thing on its way. Major downsides, in my experience: - Initially the 11x Max was impressively quiet, but it developed squeaks after only a couple weeks, and I haven't been able to fix them. Now it's even more annoying than my old loud vacuum - The ""boost"" mode is the ONLY reason to buy the Max version of a Eufly, so I wouldn't recommend spending the extra money. My 11s Max has NEVER ONCE automatically boosted up to the higher suction setting. It can be enabled manually, but it increases the noise quite a bit and the difference in cleaning is undetectable to me, while the battery life gets cut in half - The filters are very small, and will start to disintegrate if you attempt to wash them. That would be fine if replacements weren't expensive. I didn't expect filters to be much more expensive than the much larger filters for my old Neato - Charge time is extremely long. Expect as long as 6-8 hours needed to recharge after a full clean. - Dust bin is pointlessly large - the tiny filter will get clogged long before the bin could fill all the way up. Mine's never been more than about half full, and we have 3 cats - Attractive design will immediately get scratched to hell and be a fingerprint magnet. Should have been a matte finish because after a month of use, it won't look good anymore - The LED light on top is so bright, you will want to cover it with tape or a sharpie if you dock the Eufy in your bedroom. Not sure if this can be adjudged or not. - Anything taller than low profile rugs will crash the Eufy. It won't even go over the cheap carpet bath mat in the bathroom, let alone the shag rug in our office. The office has to be cleaned the old fashioned way, and we have to pick up the rug in the bathroom or keep the door closed. Everything else is hardwood, but 2 rooms in the house won't work with the Eufy, when they were no problem for older robovac. UPDATE: Lowered to 1 star because I really regret this purchase. This thing is almost useless to me. I'm sure it would still be a good fit for many people, but it's horrible for my home. I can't even count on it to do a scheduled cleaning by itself any more. It has gotten so scratched and beat up from banging into things every day, that it now has a scratched, textured ""lip"" around the front that is MUCH more prone to getting stuck and wedged under the fridge, under the counter lips, and under anything else it's stupid enough to slam into over and over again. I frequently have to go move it because it will just be grinding away making screeching noising getting itself stuck under the fridge. Why in the world it doesn't have programming smarts to STOP MOVING sooner, I don't know. Being stuck at home every day for quarantine has highlighted just how useless thing is for my situation. It is a constant source of frustration. Positive things: - Spacious dust bin - With no squeaks and the boost mode not enabled, this thing WAS impressively quiet and will shock you if you're used to a Roomba or some other robovac - Lightweight, easy to grab and place in a room for a spot clean if needed - Remote is very nice, but the scheduling options aren't up to par - Suction power is great out of the box. First few cleans were impressive, it collected finer dust particles than our old vacuum could. Not sure to credit that to the filter or overall engineering of the unit. Hoping it holds up after many filter changes and cleanings.","Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2019"
B07R295MLS,1,Junk.,"Okay, so I thought I did good research on this. I saved up for this purchase excited since we had just finished installing new floors through our entire house. As soon as the installers left, I broke out my new vacuum, downloaded the app, followed the instructions and did the required upgrade to the vacuum. Once it started to do it's first mapping route, the app immediately said network slow. The vacuum would pull out from the base about a foot and just spin, then return to the base and start drying the completelt unused mop heads. I've tried taking it to my friends house and using another person's wifi, deleting the app and reseting the vacuum multiple times, tried repositioning a few feet from our router, tried running it through my ipad instead, everything including having comcast come out and check our network. Mind you, our TVs, alexa, ans any other devices in our house work just fine on our network. Eufy App would always say network slow and not even go further than a foot from the base. Obviously something is wrong with the vacuum, not my wifi. Finally contacted customer support. First one in the chats brilliant solution was to try ro run the vacuum through Hotspot. Seemed ridiculous, but I tried. Once again, app said network slow. He then said he can't help me and that my chat log is being sent to their ""engineering department"". Waited 1-2 days for their ""engineering department"" to email me. They wanted proof of purchase, serial number, and a video of what's wrong with it. Submitted it and was told it'd be another 1-2 days while their ""engineers"" review my issue. Woke up to an email this morning from their engineers and their suggestion after everything I've told them was to ""try restarting it"". Did they even read my messages of everything I've tried to do to be able to just use and keep my vacuum? Try hot spot and restarting it is their advice from their ""engineering department"" after days of waiting for a solution? Returning this. Customer service is a joke if they ship you a faulty vacuum. Now I have to wait 30 days for a refund and then go buy a different brand.

B07R295MLS,1,Buyer Beware,"I bought this robot vacuum because it had good reviews. I had a roomba for a number of years that needed to be over hauled, by the the time I bought all the new rollers and battery, I felt like I might as well buy a new vacuum….my mistake, I should have just reconditioned it. This vacuum does a good job of picking up dirt, hair etc. if that’s all you care about and you have no obstructions, this is a great choice. However, if you have any recliners that are right at the robot’s height, or a threshold at a screen door, you will be constantly picking it up and moving it because it gets stuck. Or you may sit and watch it turn in circles for >30 seconds. I have no idea what it’s trying to do. More than once I’ve threatened throwing it in the garbage….it may end up there soon. If you’ve never bought one before, invest in one that makes a good map, knows what to avoid and avoids it. If you have a room with no furniture or cords, this may be the right vacuum for you. UPDATE 4-2-2024: After this review, customer service contacted me. They went over and above to make sure I ended up happy. The provided me with a Verge 35 and that has both met and even exceeded my expectations based on my iRobot experience. The Verge 35 maps, has an app, and does a great job of vacuuming. It is systematic in its approach, gentle when it comes up to barriers and after 2 weeks of daily use, has not gotten stuck once. It always has returned to its base….and it’s made me a very happy lady. So my latest thought is choose a Eufy, work with customer service if necessary to get your expectations met.","Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2024"
B07R295MLS,1,If you like to play hide-n-seek,"Well poop sticks!! I was super excited about getting this after reading the reviews. Thinner, bigger dirt bin, ideal for pet hair, quieter! Sounded so dreamy. Unfortunately, now that I’ve had it a few weeks I am supper disappointed in it. It was a giant waste of money!!! I have 3 Aussiedoodles which hardly shed, and this was supposed to be “Ideal” for pet hair. So I was thinking to my self, self this should be perfect. My puppers don’t shed much, but sure do bring in the dirt on their paws from living in the country. Well this was a false dream!! The roller & dirt trap need to be cleaned in the middle of use because the little pet hair I have, clog up the passageway to the dirt trap and the roller becomes a pet itself with the hair on it (I haven’t named the new pets yet) The dirt tap is a lot bigger then my Roombas, but it doesn’t matter, because the dirt can’t get in. It’s like a tease saying “oh look at me and my big space” yet in reality the opening to get to the big space gets clogged up so the space is a waste. Haha see what I did there? Waste of space? Any how... it appears her favorite game is Hose-N-Seek!! She loves to get stuck on my floor lamp & floor fan base daily. It’s like she thinks she’s a turtle who is perching up on a log to sun herself. She also likes to get trapped under my really heavy couch (pain in the ass to get out) and doesn’t have the smarts to just turn herself around to come back out. She also thinks it’s funny to go into a closet and then shut the door behind her. But her best hiding place was under my claw foot bathtub. Still haven’t figured out how or why she stopped there (except to make me play her stupid little game) because the bottom of the tub was about 3inches away from her. Oh she’s a sneaky one people!! Most days she’s so exhausted of trying to find the perfect hiding place, she doesn’t have enough energy to get back to her charging base. I’m serious everyguys... It’s like she wants to play hide-n-seek with me everyday and I’m a grown-a$$ woman who is not down for that unless there’s an adult beverage as the prize at the end of the game for wining. So far the dirty b!+<# has not fixed me one beverage for finding her, so I don’t want to play that game anymore. She’s going to go down to live in the basement where the pups aren’t allowed, there aren’t any floor fan’s or floor lamp bases to perch upon and the couch is super low to the floor so she can’t hide under it. Hope this was helpful 😊🍹 Pros: it’s quieter than the Roomba 😁","Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020"
B07R295MLS,1,I highly recommend NOT buying this vac,"Update - moving to 1 star. This robovac actually creates more work than is worth. After five...Yes FIVE replacement vacuums, I am finally giving up. It's just not worth it. It gets stuck under furniture ALL the time, so it never completes its cycle. It get stuck in some silly spin cycle and runs out of battery, so it never completes its cycle. Sometimes, it just stops in the middle of the room... So it never completes its cycle. This means that it doesn't do what it's supposed to do and I end up vacuuming anyway while it rests on its charger. This isn't a single unit problem, since I now have had six of them. It's a design issue and Eufy (bless they're hearts) keeps sending me replacement crappy unit after crappy unit, only validating that this thing is poorly designed. I'm going to get a small sense of satisfaction in completely deconstructing this thing on my bench so I can recycle its parts for hobby projects. My advice - don't waste your money on this poorly-designed junk. It will only increase your workload and your blood pressure. Original review -It's taken me a while to write this review because I really wanted to like this vac. I have had good experiences with Anker (the company that makes Eufy) so I wanted to give the vac a fair shake. The good: when it works, the vac does well. It sucks up dirt and pet hair and does run for about two hours. It's not too loud to run at night while we sleep. The bad: it only works half the time. Most nights it just stopped working and I find it in the middle of a room. It's not stuck on something, it just ran out of battery. Yes, I contacted the support team. They were great and replaced it. Twice. All did the same thing. This isn't a problem with an individual unit, it's a design issue. So, Eufy upgraded me to the next level up as a courtesy. Same problem and a new one. This one got stuck in a loop where it just spun in circles in one spot until the battery runs out. That spot was really clean, though. Back to customer support. They sent me a replacement, which ended up being someone else's dirty return (likely Amazon's fault not Eufy's). After letting them know they sent me a new replacement. This one works marginally better, but still is erratic. 3 out of 7 nights each week it doesn't finish it's cycle and I find it out of battery somewhere in the house. I'm not returning it again. I have just given up on this product line. I'm done returning and replacing. The design and programming just isn't ready for prime time. We'll just stick with this until it dies or we get too frustrated with it and then buy an actual Roomba. I hope this helps you with your buying decision.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2021"
B07R295MLS,1,Junk + Updated,"After charging, it vacuumed and when complete parked itself on the charger with power button showing pulsing orange indicating charging. It stayed this way for a few minutes but abruptly signaled an error message both visually via the power button becoming solid red and audibly via 5 beeps in groups of 3 (15 beeps total). The audible signal is give once a minute for a few minutes after which it stops beeping and leaves the power button red. Eufy doesn't list this message in the manual (very unhelpful.) I didn't misuse the product. Eufy needs to improve their documentation to include all error signals and improve the product quality control. Early product failure is annoying to customers. I for one will not buy another Eufy. ---Updated--- To their credit EufyHome did send a new battery. With the new battery the vacuum is now working -- sort of. I am not changing my rating though. I do not recommend this vacuum. I don't I understand how this vacuum has so high a rating, it is certainly not merited. I also have a Shark RV1001AE robot. Putting aside the self emptying feature of the Shark, as compared to the Shark the Eufy 11S has surprisingly poor navigation. It gets stuck quite consistently and in places where the Shark has no problem navigating. The Shark can vacuum under a king bed with a double dust ruffle or under a chair with a skirt whereas the 11S gets trapped in both cases. I see why the 11S is less expensive that the Shark, the 11S is an inferior vacuum. Even though somewhat more expensive, the Shark RV1001AE robot is a FAR better value. It has networking and so has a phone app (as opposed to the Eufy 11S line-of-site only remote). When the Shark docks, it will empty itself which is a huge help. Even better the Shark will empty itself mid run. I have 4 dogs that shed a lot, so much so that the Shark has to go back to the dock and empty itself at least once every scheduled run. While the Eufy 11S is not hard to empty we have to empty it at least once on every run. Finally the Eufy does not build much of a map, it is more like a billiard ball bouncinf off of the boundaries/obstacles in the room. The Shark builds a much better map of the room, splits it up into strips and consequently does a MUCH better vacuuming job. My only complaint is that the Shark wont do two scheduled runs in a day but as relatively inexpensive as the shark is I may get two Sharks to address the latter issue.","Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2021"
B07R295MLS,1,EXPENSIVE DISPOSABLES,"UPDATE on 3 Eufy robovacs. 1st one purchased 9/2019 - dead, buried and replaced by 3rd 1/2021. That replacement now dead. Both had batteries replaced. 2nd purchased 2/2020 still kind of working with some replacement parts and one side brush that has never worked properly. I'm very disappointed since when they worked, they did a good job. After trying Roomba (2 are still going strong in another part of the house) and Neato (don't get me started on that company!) I will return to my reliable Mieles that get the job done better and without the aggravation and endless expense. Just a few bags now and then. I can no longer recommend Eufy. Maybe technology will improve robovacs beyond the novelty stage. I replaced one of my Roomba 880 vacs with this Eufy one month ago. So far, the Eufy has out-performed the Roomba, although the Roomba also performs well. Here are some of the differences that matter to me. First, I didn't need a Wi-Fi connection or other advanced functions, so I'm happy with a simpler product. I have a long-haired dog and a cat that both shed freely. The Eufy does a much better job with pet hair and general cleaning. A bonus is that the pets don't mind the Eufy at all - it is quieter. Both pets were spooked by the Roombas, even after several years. The Eufy has a dandy edge-cleaning function and a lower profile that allows for more thorough cleaning. (And, less-frequent need to haul out the Mielr.). I have hardwood, tile and wool carpets of various thicknesses. None of the carpets have very deep pile, and the Eufy manages the transitions easily. It returns to the docking station with no problems. The Roomba - when it doesn't die under a bed or some other inconvenient place - struggles mightily to position itself on the dock. The Roomba remote is also somewhat more difficult to use. The Eufy remote is more responsive and precise. That's useful for me, since there is one room that requires some help navigating. The Roomba lighthouses are a handy aid for situations like thst. Cleaning the Roomba is a bit easier than cleaning the Eufy. Both have similar capacity bins. Eufy comes with a small tool to help with the brush rollers. Also, having brushes on each side makes sense to me. To sum up, both Eufy and Roomba live up to expectations, but Eufy works a bit better for me. I gave myself a Roomba for my 80th birthday, and I'm thrilled to be liberated. Thank you to all the wonderful techies making our lives better. Now...how about a feathery drone to do the dusting. What a super 90th b'day gift that would be!","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2019"
B07R295MLS,1,We loved it...until we hated it.,"We absolutely LOVED our eufy BoostI RoboVac 11S. It got under our couches, under our king size bed, and was constantly FULL of hair from our German Shepard and cats. I was well on its way to becoming my newest, bestest friend...until it cast itself in the role of ""frenemy"". Like most ""frenemies"" these little guys (yes, we liked the first one SO much, we bought a second one...it needed assistance as we brought home two more kittens) got cozy and became indispensable. Each day, like clockwork, they would leave their stations and begin making quick work around the house, getting each and every nook and cranny. After they lulled us into trusting them, they both committed the ultimate betrayal...death of the lithion ion battery. And both in under 6 months. The hours we had saved not having to vacuum for those 6 months, were then spent troubleshooting why these insolent betrayers would leave their stations, turn in a circle, and immediately redock without any sibilance of productivity. We used the app, we watched the videos, we read the instruction manual...and all we can come up with is that the battery life of these vacuums is less than 6 months. Please consider the cost of ownership of these and weigh if you would like to pay for new batteries every 6 months. I would have thought this was just a coincidence if it had happened to ONE of my vacuums, but no...it happened to BOTH of them around the 4 month mark.","Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2024"
B07R295MLS,1,Breaks down--3rd one that stopped working,"This is the 3rd Eufy I have had in about 3 years. The first one had a terrible noise, so loud I couldn't even run it. The second one had the motor go out on the side arm, which I paid a repair company to fix. Within a month of getting it back, it also was not working--running for about 4 minutes before continuously backing up, going in circles and stopping. I just had the same terrible loud noise with the 3rd Eufy I bought. The company--which does respond to questions very quickly--identified the problem, said it can be fixed...though it would be very complicated...then told me how much the replacement rolling brush motor would cost. This would be the very definition of the phrase, ""Throwing good money after bad."" I have no desire to buy a new Eufy every year or, in some cases, less than a year. I will be switching to another company's robovac due to the issues I have had with the Eufy robovacs. Consumers need to know they might be buying a product with severe problems that render the robovac useless. Update: Eufy support contacted me, offering me discounts on a new Eufy and other enticements to stick with the company. I declined, replying, ""As I no longer trust Eufy robovacs, I have no interest in continuing with the product. Even if you were to give me one for free, I would not accept it--as I would then have to spend the time to properly dispose of it when it stopped working."" Now, another word to any of you considering buying this product--I bought it...the first one, 3 Eufys ago, based on its high ratings and positive comments. Scrolling back, I see that most of the positive comments come within a few months of purchasing the vacuum. I too was very pleased for the first 3 or 4 months. Each time, with each new replacement Eufy--that I had to buy each time--I was happy with it for a few months. I have finally learned my lesson. I don't have the time or money to stick with this product from this company. And as for all those positive reviews? Perhaps some of those Eufys are still working. However, most people don't take the time to follow up on an initial review. It is likely there are a lot of Eufy robovacs out there that are no longer working . . . we just don't hear about them. I will try another company and sincerely hope that the new company's robovac works as advertised.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2022"
B07R295MLS,1,"Disappointed, this thing is a menace.","I'll start by saying I did not buy this vacuum as a replacement for actually using my upright vacuum, I just wanted this to maintain the appearance of my house. Spoiler Alert: It fails at even that. I have a dog with lots of black hair (I mean LOTS), without vacuuming every day while he is shedding you can easily see huge clumps of hair stuck to the carpet and yes I brush my dog daily while he is shedding. This vacuum does a good job IF it is able to complete its run once a day. I have had this over a month so I feel like I can give it a fair assessment. Pros: - It does clean well when it runs - Battery life is good - Finds its base IF it finishes its cleaning run Cons: - Roller Brush requires constant maintenance to keep this robovac cleaning well, tangles with hair easy that has to then be cut off - Navigation, it gets stuck constantly. I have this programed to run two hours before I get home so it has time to finish a run and dock before I arrive, we'll the only problem with that is it's usually not on its dock when I get home and it becomes a game of find where the robovac is stuck at. Yes I have taken to making my house as ""robovac proof"" as possible by tucking away cables, blocking off access under end tables ect... And yet this little thing finds a new way to get stuck every day, it makes me wish I saved up for something better with smart phone control or ""no go"" lines - It ruined part of my carpet. I assume what happened (it runs while I'm away) is it hung up on a dog toy and part of the wheel was touching the carpet and it continued to spin its wheels on the carpet until the battery died. I arrived home to a dirty floor, with a robovac that was stuck and had ruined the carpet underneath it. - If it finishes it does an okay job at best. Misses several spots because of its random navigation more or less just bouncing between objects, it seems to clean over the same areas multiple times. Because of its random navigation it spends a lot of time and thus power getting around simple objects like dining room chairs, corners and entertainment centers. The pictures I uploaded are it stuck in two different locations Conclusion: Not an amazing robovac even for the price, needs several improvements and I wish I saved my money for something better. 1. ""No go"" strips or smart phone control to prevent it from going places it will get stuck (under chairs, end tables, places with cables or shoe laces) 2. Better brush roll design to prevent it from getting tangled in hair and require cleaning every other day, other manufacturers (Shark, Roborock, IRobot) have been able to achieve this 3. Better sensors to prevent it from digging at the carpet when it gets stuck and trust me it will get stuck","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2019"
B07R295MLS,1,Don’t buy this,"I have had a couple of robot vacuums and I know that you have to maintain them. I have had this vacuum since the end of July. It it been less than 3 months and a sensor is missing and it won’t work. I believe the change window is closed now. I don’t know what the good reviews on other sites see about this, but it constantly gets stuck on the base of my lamps and the tiny underside of the couch. I believe this is what contributed to missing a sensor. However, I only have 2 lamps downstairs and surely everyone has a couch? This design is awful for anyone with a normal household and I am very disappointed that it won’t work at all.

B07R295MLS,1,It sucks not in a good way,"I bought one of these a couple of years ago and I loved it. A month ago the right sensors got damaged and it was spinning in circles so I went on and decided to order a new one. Well, this is not it. On their 3D video it shows a vacuum with two side brushes, this one came with only one side brush. I guess this is the new ""improved"" model. I was OK, whatever, let me give it a try. Charged it and turned on. It barely picks stuff up and my house is all tile with only one very thin area rug. It attempted multiple times to go under the couches (18"" clearance) but I guess the sensors were ""thinking"" that the shade of either couch is an obstacle and it would turn back around. That's fine but then the vacuum goes on and bumps left, right and center into chairs legs, the media center, walls. From there randomly would stop in the middle of the room and would start beeping like it's stuck or tangled but there is nothing of the sort. I would double check to make sure that everything is ok then start it again and the same thing would happen 10 min later. It's definitely noisier than my older unit. The last straw was when it went over a couple of candy sprinkles (my children were decorating Thanksgiving cookies) and didn't pick any of them up, so this unit is going back. I used to recommend Eufy to everybody. Three of my friends even bought the older model with the two side brushes and they love them but I guess the time to look for a new brand has come.

B07R295MLS,1,Used to love this inexpensive robo vac,"Update to the update: I resolved the 4 beep and solid red light error I was getting. According to the documentation that indicates a problem with the roller brush. I had removed it and cleaned it several times but found a tip on another website. One end of the roller brush has a black cap that can be pulled off with pliers. I just kept turning it with the pliers and it popped off. It is easy to slide it back on when you are done. There was a ton of hair and dust in the cap. Beneath the cap is a metal nut type thing that turns. After I cleaned out the obvious visible dust and hair, I could barely see there was hair wrapped around the axle below the metal nut. Using small tweezers I could pull up the metal nut and using the tweezers I pulled out a ton of hair that was wrapped around that small axle. Even when I couldn't see it, I pulled out more and more with the tweezers. It took me about 20 minutes with the tweezers to get all the hair tightly wound around the axle below that nut. My vac is back to working fine. I assume an easier solution would be to buy a new roller brush, but getting to that area on the brush was easy and free. Update: I loved this robovac initially but only got 1 year use out of it. I now get the well known 4 beep with solid light error which nothing seems to fix. It runs for about a minute and stops. I never would have bought this vac if I had an inkling. What's worse is I bought a second one a few months ago. At least I have a few months left on it. Original Review: Yes, it's dumb but despite the insane lack of logic in how it tackles a room, it does a fantastic job of vacuuming. I have a more expensive connected Neeto vac which has smart mapping and other neat features, but this Eufy vac puts it to shame. I 've had so many problems connecting my Neeto vac to my network that I usually run it with no connection. I do like that the Neeto vac knows when it has finished a room and I wish the Eufy did the same. I believe this vac, the Eufy, just keeps going until it realizes it needs to toddle back the dock. The Eufy does a great job of edge cleaning. My Neeto doesn't. The Eufy does an excellent job of vacuuming and you can't beat the price.","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2019"
B07R295MLS,1,"Misses spots and don't count on it to stop at balconies. It may go over. Novelty toy. Sorry, Eufy.","I pushed a coffee table out of the way to expose some dust and dirt. The cleaner made a couple of passes, but missed half of it. It continued on its way and I let it run for an hour more. It never did clean up that area. I don't know much about how these are programmed and how they decide where to go, but I would have thought it would have remembered where it cleaned and didn't clean. The pattern is just so random that I'd have to let it run for hours before it got 99% of the floor. I saw it go over the same areas repeatedly and then not touch other areas. It just doesn't seem that smart. There are edge settings to get the perimeter of a room, room settings where it sticks to a single room, and circular patterns. I haven't used them. I'm not sure how furniture would interrupt those patterns. There's also a remote where you can manually direct it, but what's the point with a ""robot""? It does pick up the dust and dirt where it passes over, though. It's only been used on hardwood floors. I have seen it clean a small area rug at an entrance, so it can go from bare floor to rug. But again, it didn't completely do the rug. It was just a couple of passes. We also have a balcony and stairs. There is a 1/4"" trim piece around these areas. So far, it hasn't gone over, but it hangs over by a few inches before it pulls back. I don't trust it. There is a disclaimer in the instructions to block off areas like this as the sensor can get dusty and it may fall. To me, that's a show stopper. Why would you want to block off areas just to vacuum?

Imagine my shock and disappointment upon opening our latest 11s Max this evening and discovering Eufy eliminated a side brush (and a brush motor) thereby decreasing the cleaning power and are passing it off as the 11s Max. This is deceptive marketing and I am absolutely livid. Eufy tricked me into spending the same amount for literally half the cleaning power. Unacceptable. Deceptive marketing and corporate ethics aside, I don't recommend the 11s Max vaccum.

B07R295MLS,1,"I like Eufy, just not this model","Let me say first of all that we have had a Eufy Robovac 30 for several years, and honestly, I am happy with it. It was my husband's idea to look for a new vacuum that had enough suction to pick up cat litter. (He'd seen one in an ad on TV.) Since we don't even have a cat, that requirement seemed silly, but I told him I'd see what I could find. I read many articles reviewing robot vacuums and then read lots of reviews from owners of the top vacuums. I didn't want my husband buying one of the most expensive models, but maybe I could find something in the mid-price range with good reviews. Believe it or not, the reviews led me to another Eufy - this time the 11s MAX. When it arrived, I charged it, read the booklet, and finally set it free to show off it's super suction power. Within minutes, however, my husband and I both noticed that it was leaving behind clumps of dog hair as it traveled around the living room. I figured I hadn't done something right and read again through the quick start instructions, but when I tried it again, the same thing happened. I was so disappointed! I had really wanted this new vacuum to work. I mean it's suction power was supposed to be more than that of our old Eufy. I called Customer Service, hoping maybe the agent would say, ""Did you do such and such?"" or ""Try this."" But there was no clear reason for the problem. In the end, the agent sent me a free return label and said she would like to send me a replacement MAX. So, I returned the new MAX and soon received a second. I was so hoping that we'd just gotten a lemon the first time. Again I charged the new Robovac and watched with great interest to see if this one would do the job we hoped it would. But much to my disappointment, this one too left little clumps of hair in it's wake. When I checked, it had indeed picked up some dirt, but the dog hair left behind was undeniable. Our old 30 does a much better job on our dog hair. It leaves no clumps! So again I returned the MAX, using another free label sent to me by Customer Service at Anker, and the cost was fully refunded. Let me say, I have no complaints with the Anker Customer Service. But I cannot recommend the 11SMAX. I do, however, feel the eufy 30 model we have is quite good: it works fine for us. It also has strips to keep the vacuum away from areas where I don't want it to go. For some reason, the MAX doesn't have that capability.","Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2021"

This apparently satisfied the machine and it ran fine again. Doesn't clean as well, but it still works. Now, after two years of working (mostly) flawlessly on my upstairs floor, this thing decides to throw itself down the stairs. Odd, but probably a fluke.

It took 45 mins for it to finally find it's base after I placed it in front of the base. Value for money absolutely! Wish I could give it a 5 but I'm in the process of returning it and getting the X10 Omni. Also mine did not avoid obstacles at all... grabbed wires, ran into everything.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"
B07R295MLS,1,"After only 2.5 yrs of light, infrequent use no longer vacuums up-ANYTHING","I bought this for light carpet cleaning. While I still tended to go for my manual upright vacuum because it is MUCH more effective, I thought this would work well in between the big vacuuming jobs. The first couple of months it seemed to do the trick, and considering what I paid, I took good care of it, thoroughly cleaning/emptying Robo after each job. Unfortunately, it didn't take long for it to stop picking up even the lightest items. Also, starting about 6 months ago, fully charged, it has resorted to bewilderingly just stopping in the middle of ""vacuuming,"" turning its light orange, and beeping as though stuck on something when there's nothing in its way! I read that it could be that the sensors have gotten misaligned, so I followed the instructions to try to correct that, which made zero difference. It starts right back up again when I aim the remote at it and press one of the buttons, such as whole room cleaning. But 30 seconds or so later, it stops, turns orange, and beeps again. BTW, just to clarify, this is NOT because it needs to be re-charged. I already tested that. Additionally, there is little, if any, suction. Observing this ""vacuum"" in action, the only part of it that seems to pick up anything is the rotating brush. I was initially fooled into thinking a room was well vacuumed because of the brush strokes all over it. But when I started looking more closely, I saw it hadn't actually suctioned up much of anything. Even after I have it circle over one or two tiny carpet fibers for 10 seconds, the best it does is flick them away! After a few such disappointing performances, I thought cleaning the brush as well as emptying the lint catcher every time would help, and this is no picnic, especially if you have pets or long-haired humans in your house; the hair gets wound so tightly around the brush, it often requires major scissor surgery to remove. And this extra cleaning step has made no difference to the ""vacuuming"" results. Most of the higher reviews seem to be for hard, rather than carpeted, surfaces and when the user has owned this device for only a short time. I'd love to hear what experience others with carpeted floors who've also taken good care of their Robos have had after one to two years of light use. It's disappointing to see that rather than fix whatever design flaws are causing such poor performance over time, the seller has raised the price another $50!","Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2021"
B07R295MLS,1,Only Lasted 8 Months,"I liked this while it worked. This robovac was used 3- 4 times per week, with very few problems then suddenly, in the middle of a cleaning cycle it just stopped in the middle of the floor. The status light changed from blue to a solid red, and the unit gave a series of 4 beeps. According to the troubleshooting guide, this is indicative of a stuck roller brush. I removed the roller brush, gave it a thorough cleaning, and reinstalled it. The vac started right up, but stopped two minutes later and gave the same code. I removed the rotating brush entirely and tried running the vac without it - same result. Clearly the problem is not the rotating brush. A Google check shows that that this is a very common Eufy problem - sometimes resolved by cleaning the brush, but often not. Fortunately, my unit is still under warranty; unfortunately, Eufy customer service has not yet agreed to accept the unit back for repair or replacement. Instead, they keep suggesting troubleshooting options that have not resolved the issue. Bad enough that the robovac died after only 8 months of gentle use, but the bad experience is compounded by a customer service department that is hesitant to honor the warranty. To be continued ... Update 07/22/2019 - In accordance with the terms of the warranty, the company sent me a “refurbished” unit that arrived today. Unfortunately, despite the shipping box being entirely intact this refurbished unit arrived damaged. The front bumper is broken and won’t stay in place. Customer service has been notified via email and a picture. I’m waiting for a response, and still don’t have a usable vacuum. Update: 07/28/2019 - Anker provided a replacement bumper to be installed on their “refurbished” unit. Installation completed, and the vacuum appears to be working as intended. Good follow-up from customer service, but the fact remains that the quality of this product is questionable at best. If you take the time to read all the reviews, you’ll find far too many reporting that their Eufy died after only a few month’s use. I suspect that the vast majority of 5 star reviews came from people who reviewed their product shortly after receiving it, and who had no longer term perspective. This is not a quality vacuum. The “refurbished” replacement comes with no warranty of it’s own. It is warranted only for the time remaining on the original unit’s warranty. To me, that means Anker has no faith in whatever work they did to refurbish the robovac they send you to replace the one that died.","Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2019"
B07R295MLS,1,Great product with a single big problem,"UPDATE: I have changed my review from 5 starts to 1. The reason is the robot turns on by itself almost every day at 6AM. We make sure the timer is OFF, but it gets started anyways. This has caused the vacuum to suddenly start working on unprepared floors, with toys and objects around, that get stuck on the machine and will eventually damage it. And not to mention it wakes us up at 6AM. It is a pity because otherwise we were happy with the purchase. But this software issue ruins it all. ORIGINAL REVIEW BEFORE NOTICING THE PROBLEM: As a mom with 2 little girls and a dog this robot vacuum changed my life. The amount of dirt this thing gets is impressive. We turn it on twice a day and the robot gets it all, including rest of food, dog hair, and microscopic dirt we didn’t imagine was there. Every time we empty the dirt compartment we’re shocked but glad all that dirt is gone. The robot is very easy to use, intuitive, with a remote control easy to set up and handle. The robot has its own on/off button in case you can’t find the remote. You can also use the remote to direction the robot making it so easy to vacuum specific zones or go for a quick clean up. The battery lasts more than an hour, which is more than enough to clean what I need (around 40mt2). I get the impression the robot keeps going until the battery needs recharge instead of stopping when the place is clean. The robot goes back to its charging place 10/10 of the times. Notice we give it generous space on the sides and front as it’s suggested in the instructions. The suction power is good and it switches from normal to max automatically, but you can also choose the suction power yourself. The noise is totally bearable, nothing in comparison to a classic vacuum. The negative: the sticker it came with (to keep the robot in place inside the packaging) that wasn’t easy to remove and the glue got got stuck on the plastic. I still couldn’t remove it. Picture attached. It’s bothersome the vacuum needs so many accessories to replace over time (filters, brushes, etc). After the initial buy we had to make another purchase with such accessories. Still, totally worthy. Overall we’re so happy we got this vacuum, it has literally changed our life (especially mine ha!) for the best. So much time gained and the results are so much better than cleaning the old way.","Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2021"
B07R295MLS,1,No replacement parts :(,"Id love to give this amazing little robot a perfect 5-star rating. but... here's the ugly for anyone looking to purchase this albeit fantastic little machine. After about 6mos the battery runtime was cut down to about half of the advertised rated time. The vacuum will run reliably for a little more than 70min total. I did have the first unit replaced under warrantee and its worth mentioning that Anker customer service is wonderful and very accommodating. The battery ran down again after about 7mos and instead of going through the hassle of having the unit replaced, I purchased a new battery. Cost of doing business. Batteries don't last forever. I've had the new unit now for about 18mos and it has begun making a slipping noise from the main roller brush. After some tinkering, I found the drive belt to be worn. Realizing I was out of warranty and looking only for a replacement part, I contacted Anker support and asked to purchase a replacement drive belt for the main roller brush. Anker has no parts available for purchase. I was informed that I could purchase a replacement refurbished unit for 80$. That is the only option other than tossing eufy in the garbage. I hate that we live in a throwaway world. This was one of the lesser expensive automated vacuum options at the time of purchase but, now the price has almost doubled from my original purchase. You get what you pay for. I really love this little vacuum and will try to source the part myself. Buyer beware. It is a good product but... no spare parts and it does occasionally chew on shoelaces... It's a shame really. Like I said would like to keep this vacuum but... you get what you pay for. There are better options. Keep looking UPDATE: I purchased a replacement part from another generic manufacturer, albeit of lesser quality than the OE it was very inexpensive and eufy Is back up and running. Better than throwing it away and buying a new one after only 18mos of use. I do have occasional trouble with this vacuum but, its to be expected and much can be avoided by routine maintenance, cleaning, and making sure obstacles are kept clear. With a little tinkering and help from the internet, you can keep this going for a long time. Or you can call Anker and they can sell you a new/ refurbished one and you can throw yours away.... after 18mos. Regarding the comment from Anker support. PLEASE READ MY REVIEW. YOU WERE THE FIRST POINT OF CONTACT FOR ME. I was fully aware I was no longer under warranty and I was informed you do not have parts available. I could buy a refurbished unit at a reduced cost. Just because I've left a poor and honest review you now want to assist me.","Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2019"
B07R295MLS,1,Waste of money,"I had expected this robot vacuum to be amazing given how many positive reviews it received. However, I was immedately disappointed. My entire home is vinyl flooring with a couple thin rugs. It frequently got stuck on the rug and the brush head fell off. It also does a terrible job around the room and frequently boxed itself into a corner, unable to clean the remaining room. It's also quite aggressive and doesn't always stop when it senses an item. It jammed my toes while I was working and took off my door bumpers. Waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2024"
B07R295MLS,1,It really couldn't be any less good at its job if it tried.,"This is our first robotic vacuum and I think probably the last. On the back of the reviews and recommendations on websites we were excited to try this. It seemed like a sensible price point to dip our toes into the market. Once charged, it comes out the charge stand and goes off on a random wander for an hour and a half and then may, or may not, find its base again. The fact that it does actually find its base every now and again is easily its best feature. Actually it's pretty much its only redeeming feature. I suppose it's pretty quiet, but then it has all the puff of a 50 a day smoker. I really have no idea how this thing gets such good reviews. Pardon the pun, but it sucks! It's supposed to be a vacuum and clean up mess. Keep that in mind. But you can watch it come into a room, and randomly wander about like a demented lunatic. Any obvious bits of dirt etc on the floor WILL be missed. Over and over. You find yourself staring at it and wishing it luck as it heads where you want. But it misses the dirt almost every time. It's like watching a horse race where your favorite never wins! Anyone thinking that it will ""save time"" is wrong if they have either an open plan house, or mess from kids and pets. If you have an open plan house the first thing you have to do is ""vacuum proof"" it. Move things to block cables as it likes to try and eat those. Move things in front of fans, as it gets stuck on those. Move all the dining chairs as it will bounce around like a pinball machine under the table. Once you've done this lot, and then let it run and found it's picked up nothing you wanted, you may as well have just got your Dyson\Shark\whatever out to start with. And those full sized machines pull 2000W of power. This thing is less than a 10th of that. I think these things only work for smart singletons that are out at work all day and don't really have much mess anyway. It really couldn't be any less good at its job if it tried.","Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2019"
B07R295MLS,1,Shattered glass everywhere due to design flaw,"Less than two months after purchasing this vacuum, I woke up to a nasty surprise. The day before, it could not find its way back to the cradle, which didn't happen too often. Thinking it had a drained battery, my wife put it on the kitchen island in the morning to keep my young kids from damaging it. She forgot to put it back in the cradle that day. I was coming back from a business trip late that same night, and wondered what it was doing on the island. With my wife already asleep, figured she had put it there for a reason and went to bed. A few hours later, a large crash woke me up in the middle of the night. Figuring the schedule had come on, I groaned and went back to bed planning to deal with it in the morning. When I got downstairs, there were tiny pieces of shattered glass all over my >600 sq.ft. great room. And I mean all over - they had ejected themselves to all corners of the room and into hallways. Took me over an hour to clean it up (kind of the opposite experience I was hoping for with a robovac) and I was late for work as a result. Again, I have little kids and can't leave glass all over the house. This thing has a glass top for discernibly no reason other than looks that could be accomplished with plastic or metal. It is quite thick and makes the thing top heavy, so in a short fall from counter height, it will flip over and land upside down, shattering into thousands of tiny pieces (as it does not appear to be safety glass either). The so-called drop sensing technology did not save me either. So I am left with a broken robovac that I've had in the closet ever since as it's a hazard and I don't want to find out what else it has in store for me. I didn't even get to use it long enough to use any of the replacement parts it comes with, only going through a couple of the service intervals of light cleaning before replacing worn parts. All eufy needs to do is use tempered glass or another material altogether to remove a lot of potential danger. I wouldn't expect the drop sensors to work flawlessly, so it needs to be designed to fall.","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2019"

B07R295MLS,1,"Don't be fooled by the other reviews, you get what you pay for.","I bought this vacuum on sale during Prime day or black Friday. I saw the reviews and figured I couldn't go wrong. I am not sure if the other reviewers have never owned a robot vacuum or what, but this one is terrible. It has absolutely no room cleaning AI. It drives in random directions, literally diagonally zigzagging across your rooms cleaning a few lines before it moves on to the next room by chance. It doesn't seem to have any room mapping or memory capabilities, there is no rhyme or reason to how it cleans. It just goes forward until it runs into something and then it alters its path and continues on. I have been very frustrated with this purchase and wish I had paid for a better one. I used to have a 400$ one and it worked much better for 3 or 4 years until it finally broke. Pro's - Long battery life. It seems to clean for up to around 2 hours before returning to the charging base. - It does have decent suction, it fills its tiny dust bin pretty frequently. - It's cheap, money wise. Cons - No room mapping - Drives in random directions with no strategy for cleaning rooms - Small dust bin, requires frequent emptying (at least once a day) - It's cheap, quality wise. - Does not get the job done. You will still have to vacuum or sweep frequently if you buy this, your house will not look clean with this vacuums performance. - Gets stuck very frequently and does not learn from its mistakes. You will always find it stuck in the same spots; and it only completes a cycle and makes it to its charging base about 50% of the time. - High tendency to suck up and/or destroy exposed cords (cell phone charging cords, electrical cords, etc). You have to be very careful to make sure all cords are off the floor or tied up tightly. - It can't handle black rugs or carpets. It thinks they are barriers and gets stuck or just turns away from them. But I believe most robot vacuums have this flaw. - Seems to have Feet/pet homing technology. It always tries to run over feet and pets. TLDR: - Do not buy this vacuum. Get a better one, I wish I did.","Reviewed in the United States on February 29, 2020"
B07R295MLS,1,Horrible disappointment in this unit,"Over the holidays, I decided to look for a good sale on Amazon. Though not looking for anything in particular, this robovac caught my eye. The price was cheaper than any others I'd seen that do pretty much the same thing. So I got one. This robovac really works. I haven't attached all the pieces yet, just decided to see how it worked. It made the rounds, randomly, throughout my whole first floor: living room, dining room, kitchen and hallway. I ran it for 3 days straight without hardly any supervision. It picked up six full loads of dust and dirt. The dust bin is somewhat small, but holds what you need. When it gets full, it stops. A series of different colored lights on the back tell you what the problem is and what to do to fix it. Each evening, I place it on the chargers and it's ready to go the next day. It is supposed to find its way back to ""home"" automatically, but I have a large first floor and midway is around two corners. I'm so pleased, I just bought a second one for my son. And recommended it to a friend who bought it. UPDATE: 5/16/19 Rarely have I ever been as disappointed with a purchase as I am now with this robovac. It no longer works at all. The charging base is lit up, but the vacuum unit won't move. I checked the remote and changed the batteries. Nothing. Nada. I tried moving it manually, thinking I could trick it into action. Not happening. I had bought one for my son, who is much more tech savvy, and asked him to help me make it work. He came over and played with it awhile. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I definitely would like a Eufy tech to give me a call or email and see what I can do about this. I unfortunately threw away the box (thinking it would last indefinitely, after the first month). UPDATE: Nothing at all hear from Eufy. If I hear nothing before the one year period ends, I'll update this review. And it will be very very bad.","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2019"
B07R295MLS,1,Great at first.,"Eufy worked great at first. For about 6 months I'd say. Then it started to have a lot of problems. Now, less than 2 years after purchase, it is completely unusable. To the company's defense they are very good at communication regarding their product. They even sent me a new lens when they felt that could be the problem I was having. But having to remove all the tiny little screws (that stripped immediately) to replace the lens, isn't something you expect to have to do after less than a year. Almost immediately after replacing the lens the brushes quit spinning. They would just sit and make a horrible grinding noise when they brushed up against something even very lightly or when running along a wall. I think its important to mention that all the floors in my home are hard surfaces and should be very easy for Eufy to at least sweep up the dust bunnies. It became so underpowered over the last 6 months it wouldn't even pick up the tiniest crumbs. I kept the unit very clean and followed all the manufacturers guidelines to the ""T"". I used to run it on automatic every day at noon and eventually reduced that to a once a week cleaning trying to extend its life. It still became progressively worse at performing its duties. So, since the warranty is up and the unit is just a loud robot that does no cleaning whatsoever, I threw it in the trash this morning. RIP eufy. What a waste of money and time messing with all the cleaning and replacing of parts. Amazon has repeatedly disappointed with their plethora of sub par products that obviously get inflated reviews (probably from the manufacturers or people who haven't had their product in question for very long and are making premature emotional reviews) I would not buy this product because my home should be a super easy one for an automatic vacuum to at least suck up the unseen dust along walls and such. I have a Hoover vacuum that I bought for less than a hundred bucks 10 years ago and I can vacuum my whole house in less than 10 minutes versus the 3 hour runtime of Eufy and an eventual shutdown less than 2 years after purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2019"
B07R295MLS,1,Does not last 1 year. Junk.,"Update: After less than a year, the vacuum does not work at all. Won't turn on. Basically, it's a short-term novelty that I wasted money on and just this week threw in the trash. If you do buy it, definitely buy the extended warranty because I suspect you'll need it. Previous review: After almost 4 months with the vacuum, here's where I'm at: Likes: Easy to use out of the box, easy to empty dirt, and fairly quiet. Also, it leaves some battery charge so that you can find it and help it dock in the inevitable outcome that it often can't find the dock or gets stuck on my recliner feet and other places that are tough to avoid. Dislikes: The suction isn't that great for the speed. Oddly, the machine is slower in reverse and I manually have to make it go over something in reverse if I really want a shot of it being picked up. I wish there was an even slower setting than it has (in forward). It does significantly better on carpeting than my plank tiled floors. On the tile, it mostly just shoots things around the room. I've stopped using it on tiles unless I want it to try to catch some hair under the sink. Vacuuming cat litter--forget about it. Again, mostly shoots it around the laminate floor. My biggest complaint, however, is that it's already more or less broken. One of the spinning brush arms doesn't seem to align properly anymore and makes a very annoying noise that won't go away (even with a new brush attachment). As a result, I have a one-brush vacuum now and just leave one of the brushes permanently off. That's unacceptable for owning this for a couple of months. I have about 750 sq/feet of carpeting and I'd say to do a decent job, it takes two charges if I let it wander about. Because of this, I wish you could set the machine to turn on automatically more than one time per day. I paid $159 in June and I see it's now up to $219 -- it's barely worth it at $159, but if you want a cheap robot vacuum, then hold out for $159 or less on this model. Don't pay $219.","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2020"

B07R295MLS,1,Both my original and my replacement had issues :( (updated),"I’m completely changing my review from 5 stars to 2 (update: now 1) because I’m extremely frustrated with this product. It worked well for me for 5 months and then would stop completely and beep once after 5 minutes of running. It was cleaned well but nothing worked and it would still stop. After contacting customer service, they sent a new one. Great. It worked fine for about 2ish months and then started having completely different issues. The replacement was extremely loud and wouldn’t go over my thin rug, but would rather get it’s bristles stuck on it and then continually grind trying to get unstuck instead of backing up or stopping. It wouldn’t stop when stuck on anything or if it got stuck under furniture that didn’t have a high enough clearance. So it would run out of battery and just sit there grinding until someone fixed it. I reached out to customer service AGAIN about the issue and they offered to send another replacement. But what’s the point of this replacement breaks down, ya know? My house isn’t meant to have a Eufy and in order to get it to work for me, I’d need to just completely replace 75% of my furniture. So I explained this to the team and asked for a refund since I cannot use their product. But since it is out of the 30 day window, they are refusing a refund. I’m disappointed with this product. I loved it at first... but after many issues, replacements that continually have issues, a baby that is terrified of it, and most of my furniture causing the product to get stuck underneath, I’m just done with it. Update: now 1 Star... I was still refused a refund so I agreed to a 3rd replacement... when I received my 3rd replacement (luckily fast shipping), the box was dinged up... taped up... looked opened and then taped back up with random packing tape.

B07R295MLS,1,"[UPDATE] Looks like a good robot, but it's too cheap even if you want to go cheap","[UPDATE] After only 2 months of use, the robot went crazy, spinning around itself. Contacted Amazon, which put me in contact with the manufacture. They asked for pictures, movies, S/N etc. Then they basically said the robot might have bumped into something and the trail/sensor got misplaced. Then gave me a list of things to do to repair it. I don't mind trying to fix it myself, but this should be pristine after only 2 months of use. Will I have to do it every 2 months? Will it eventually break for good in 6 months? if I have to babysit the robot so it does not bump into things, then I'm better off with a top-of-line manual vacuum (pretty much the same price as the robot). The whole deal of having a vacuum robot is that I don't need to supervise it. Just run as far you can and spend a hundred bucks more for a decent robot. If they want to make cheap products, at least they should invest in customer service. ======= It's not a bad purchase. But it's not something you can rely on in unsupervised mode. Most times I turn it on and after a while, I have to go check on it and manually control it to go to some blind spots. My main complaint is that was advertised as quiet, which is not (it's almost as noisy as our standard vacuum cleaner). It does not do well in the transition between rooms, carpets, and electric wires (most times it gets stuck). This last point is the most frustrating, it makes it harder to use it than just getting the vacuum cleaner and do it ourselves. It does not do great nearby walls and corners. In summary, it's a nice piece if you want to spend 1/2 the cash than a real good one. It's also ideal for large, open spaces. I am actually taking it to my office and buying another brand for our home.","Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2021"
B07R295MLS,1,Very Inefficient and not user friendly,"My first impression on seeing it work was that it was highly inefficient. It would wander around the same area multiple times and not reach certain other areas at all. And it was very prone to getting stuck at the slightest of obstacles. Ordinary corridors between my bathroom and bedroom would prove insurmountable for this poor Roomba and it would die down trying to cross it. I would have to eliminate any wiring from the floor and also keep it away from my standing fan as the vacuum would always try to climb up the fan. It was hilarious to watch at first, but soon it turned into frustration. But even with very thorough prepping, the vacuum would find something new every day to be stuck under. Could be below the fridge, edge of the carpet, the door stopper. ""Finding the roomba"" was becoming a daily chore for me when I returned home. Soon I started running the roomba only when I was home, but it's noise levels and inefficient meandering made it hard to do anything else in the meantime - like watching TV or trying to work. It's bin capacity is very small, the components are very flimsy - the rotor blades came off many times and I had to hunt around the house to find them a few times, and it has no APP to control/monitor it. The battery life is also not good and docking station/vacuum interface is not user friendly. Sometimes after hours of ""charging"" I would find that the connection between the vacuum and docking station was not firm enough or the vacuum isn't smart enough to return to it's docking station on its own when its battery life is low. In hindsight, I should have spent a bit more on a ""smarter"" robot vacuum, one with preferably an app for monitoring and a smarter algorithm for detecting and avoiding obstacles and also moving around the house in a more efficient way. The only positive thing about it was the humor value of it's inefficiency. I'd definitely recommend against buying this model.","Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2019"

B07R295MLS,1,On my second from a warranty replacement. Nightmare.,"When my first unit malfunctioned after less that 4 months --(hardwood floors, so don't get excited that the little genius was overworked), it spun around in circles and quit. Over and over again. Let me tell you, I stock up on filters, replacement parts, etc. Changed everything out, followed every trouble shooting possibility. Engaged with Anker online/email to help fix it. Explained the problem. Seems to be some magical time period that a warranty would expire. Tech emails never arrived less than a full week later. Tech support... try this try that. Send video. We can't really see good in video (off-shore sentences and pronunciation) send again or maybe send to Dropbox. If you need to send to drobox, we give you address. (OK, LET ME STAND ON MY HEAD, AGAIN, FOR YOUR NEXT ADVICE!) Every reply is at least 5-10 days apart. Finally managed to exchange the little POS; and they want you to take a refurb unit and no warranty. Replacement arrives and the only way it operates after every use is to pull the battery pack, as instructed by the ONLY reasonable call (you're going to need to have a tiny, tiny computer screwdriver to get at those screws -- the guy was amazed that I actually had one, very handy. He was best help ever!) Herein lies the problem with my second, Eufy replacement. I gave up taking and resetting the battery back. Found out that it has to be switched off after EVERY use. So, yay, vacuum in the morning, no potential for scheduling a second time in the day. I have to switch it off/on every time. After going through, what I did and the TREMENDOUS time and lags to get a cure, or replacement, Eufy replaced my first unit under full warranty (new) but, it might has well be a refurbished replacement with no warranty. They wear you out --- only you are held to time frames - and they count on it. do not buy! NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BE A BOAT ANCHOR.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2021"
B07R295MLS,1,Different algorithm than the 11S - kinda stupid,"We've had an 11S for several years, and loved it. When it had finally pooped out, I was originally going to just replace it, but for some reason I noticed this llS Max. I figured it was the 11S w/ more suction power. But no - the operating logic has changed. This robot is stupid. The original 11S was able to operate reliably night after night without fail. The 11S Max is lucky to make it through any single night. Nearly every morning I need to go on a hunt for it, and while some of the problems it has faced are legitimate, many are just unexplainable. For instance, many mornings I'll find it in one of the rooms, with no nearby obstructions and no fouling of either the brush or the roller. Just stopped. I usually just turn it back on, and many times it goes for quite a while, and sometimes the battery is actually just used up. I like the single side brush and the added little rubber scraper behind the roller brush. These changes make sense, but whatever changes have been made to the operating logic are pretty bad. In short, this guy is worthless in our house.","Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2024"

B07R295MLS,1,Not ready for normal use,"The engineering of this unit is not sufficient to keep it working in a normal house environment for more than a year. The roller brush will eventually pick something up during a cleaning cycle that will seize it. This will result in the failure of the roller brush 'transmission' unit which is ridiculously difficult to replace. The same thing will happen again, and again, and again. After the first failure I was offered a free replacement transmission (two gears with a belt between them) which I accepted and installed. The replacement lasted two months until something once again wound around the roller brush and stripped out the transmission. I cleaned the roller brush regularly to prevent this, to no avail. Installing a new transmission resulted in the same outcome several months later. Most of the highly-rated reviews of this vacuum are ‘initial experiences’. If you read some of the low-rating reviews they report the same experience I had – repetitive failures in a normal vacuum environment. The engineering strategy of this unit is poor at best. I purposefully bought a 'dumb' unit - I don't like the idea of someone storing a map of my house on their server. I expected the unit to vacuum erratically and randomly – which it did. I expected this unit to at least vacuum 'unintelligently' in a reliable no-breakdown fashion. It only had to vacuum one room and pick up dropped bird food. The unit could not reliably handle a one-room task. Look elsewhere for a reliable robotic vacuum – this one is not what you’re looking for.","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2022"
B07R295MLS,1,It's a mixed bag so far...,"I bought this because I have two dogs that shed all over the house. For a few weeks, it was a god-send. I'd use it on my hard floors only and then I would only need to wet-mop once a week to get rid of any mud the dogs had brought it... it was fantastic. I learned quickly though, that this thing is not the most durable. It's perfectly understandable to have to clean it out every few days, as no machine this small should be expected to deal with so much dog hair, but after less than two months, the primary brush-roll has already had it's key stripped, so it no longer turns. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if it wasn't the one thing they don't give you a replacement part for when you order the replacement part pack... so I have to order them manually, and they aren't on prime so now my vacuum is going to be out of order for a month or more according to the package delivery estimate. That's absolutely ridiculous, and they should really fix up the keys with a metal piece instead of incredibly malleable plastic that can bend and melt if the brush-roll gets stuck... tl;dr - Three stars, because although it's been great for the last two months, now it's out of commission for possibly an entire month due to a major oversight by Eufy... UPDATE: Pushed down to 2 stars. They sent me two new brushrolls on warrantee, and one of them has already had the same thing happen to it... the square key gets rounded down and the brush roll will no longer turn. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS VACUUM IF YOU HAVE ANY HAIRED PETS. Also Eufy products have now been proven to spy on their owners. Namely, their cameras upload images of the home owners without their consent. None of their products can be trusted now. DO NOT BUY THIS.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2019"
B07R295MLS,1,Cannot recommend,"We received the Eufy 11S on July 7th. We replaced the filters & side brushes etc as instructed. We purchased replacement parts in September (note they were not Eufy, as we couldn't find them.) Changed the parts again as instructed. At the end of October it began making a grinding noise, so we changed the parts again. November 5th we contacted Eufy as (it scheduled to run between 12:00 - 1:00 AM) the noises had become increasingly louder and were now waking us. The initial correspondence suggested we change the parts & verify everything was clean. We did, the noises continued and added a few more sounds for good measure. On 11/19, they offered us a refurbished unit & said we could keep the original as well. We explained we wanted a new machine with a postage paid box. They said they could do that, however all ORIGINAL parts had to be returned as well. As we had changed the replaceable items & didn't save them, we were unable to meet that request. We asked for a full refund, they countered with 80% but advised us that normally it would be 65%. We conceded and accepted a refurbished unit. We received a Robo Vac 30, this unit is clunky, loud & gets lost trying to find it's base. We now have 2 units that are not worth having. We will save and get a Rumba, sometimes less expensive is just cheap (lesson relearned.) Hopefully your experience will be better than ours. **updated to add** the company wrote & asked us our opinion on the refurbished model. We essentially repeated what was said above. They wrote back saying they would replace both with a new machine. Based upon our experiences with the 2 machines we had, we declined their offer. We can't foresee a 3rd machine working any better. 12-15 update. Anker did issue a full refund, we will be returning both units.","Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2020"

B07R295MLS,1,Customer service dissatisfaction,"I ordered the product in the last month of 2022. After I started using it, I continued to use it even though I received an e-mail from Amazon warning that the product could pose a fire risk due to the heating of the batteries. The product had been on its own for about 2 months and I had to look for it at home. Since we had a similar product from another brand, I was getting by. Finally, I couldn't resist and contacted EUFY and explained my problem. They asked me to remove the battery and put it back in. I did that too, but the result did not change. As you can see, my problem was not solved. As a solution, customer service suggested that I buy a new battery and gave a 30% discount for this battery. Although the other brand product has a usage period of 2.5 years, it works just as well as the first day. Apparently, the company considers it normal for the battery to run out of life in about a year. When you buy the product, please consider that its battery will last for a maximum of one year.","Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024"
B07R295MLS,1,DO NOT BUY,"This is not a product you want to spend your money on. It’s lifespan is laughable. When I first received the vacuum it performed very well. It’s quiet and powerful. I too liked this product because it is slim and fit under most of my furniture. HOWEVER, the first one I received began to drive in odd directions and continually spin in circles. So I decided to call the manufacturer. I will say that when I called the customer service number I received some of the best service I’ve seen in a long time. The gentleman I spoke to was kind and curtious. He quickly assisted me and decided to send me an entirely new unit. All I had to do was ship the first one back. I was pretty happy about that. Again, great customer service. I received the second unit very quickly and put it right back to work. It too worked well but that too was not long lived. It literally started doing the SAME thing as the first one. So once again I called the manufacturer and they were very kind and courteous. They were unsure as to how this would happen twice. They did however mention that the two units I was sent were very close in serial numbers. The gentleman on the phone noted the possibility of a bad “batch”. So again they offered to send me a third one, which they did. Now here we are AGAIN. I’ve had three of these vacuums since September, three months, and I’m having the same issue. I’m really at a loss as to what steps to pursue next but I wanted to share my experience with others to help in your buying decision.

B07R295MLS,1,Doesn’t last long doesn’t clean,"I wanted to love this vacuum after reading other reviews, but after trying for 5 months I can’t. It is the worst robot vacuum we have purchased. I do understand it is not an intelligent mapping robot, but it doesn’t even get to all the rooms. The battery seems to only last about 40-45 min so there is a lot of debris left in each room. We have a small area we want it to do only about 600-700 sq ft. Most the time there is a whole room untouched. Unfortunately, we now are in the search for a replacement.

B07R295MLS,1,Unfortunately This Eufy is a no-go for me,"The robovac is either broke or the Randomization software is glitchy. My roomba 770 purchased at least 4 years ago recently died. RIP Roomba!! The thing banged into couch and walls too many times and it finally decapitated the front home sensor. Thought I’d try this one from Eufy. The good: it’s sooo quiet especially compared to my old Roomba! The bad: the random navigation is seriously lacking and it isn’t so random. The vac OFTEN loops in the same patterns. It OFTEN repeats patterns and gets caught in corners or in between stool legs or tight spaces. The vac seems to loop and unable to get out of its preset pattern. Even my super old Roomba was better at the randomization. The issue is most persistent when when trying to go to its home dock. Note I typed ‘trying’, that’s because it usually never gets to the home dock. When ready to dock The Eufy will edge the walls until it picks up the docking signal. At least that’s the design. However somehow it edges my hallway walls and just As it appears it will go into the living room area, which is wide open and where the dock is located, it makes a turn and loops back into the hallway. This happens until battery dies or I move into the living room. Also, the machine has a tendency to get caught under the corners of couches. Roomba used to the same thing but it would have enough horse power and directional randomness to get itself out... Eufy just gets stuck sand stay stuck. I’ve rarely come home to a clean vacuum house and Eufy in its dock. Maybe my Eufy is defective. Very disappointed considering a machine from four or five years ago seems so much better and reliable than this newer Eufy.","Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2019"
B07R295MLS,1,Battery life is no good!,UPDATE FROM PRIOR REVIEW: Customer Service replied to my prior review that the battery had died after only six months. They had told me they would replace the battery if that what was needed. I advised them what I had already put into my review. Customer Service did not acknowledge my anwser to their email. They did not honor the warranty on the unit. I PURCHASED A BATTERY AT MY EXPENSE AND CORRECTED THE PROBLEM MYSELF. I have 2 I-Robots at home and bought my mother and I Robot for her home and have never had any problems with any of the I-Robots. I Lowered my initial 2 Star rating to a 1 Star rating due to the warranty not being honored on the battery and for EUFY's poor Customer Service!!! Get yourself an I Robot if you want a 5 Star product!! My 11S cleans fine when it runs. It is 6 months old and will only run for 2 minutes after a 24 hour charge. I only run it on Friday night after closing my office on weekends. Not happy with this at all. I have a 3 year old Shark Robot at home that still runs with a full charge.

B07R295MLS,1,DO NOT BUY,"1. I bought this specifically because it said it was return/refundable or replaceable. Not customer service is telling me it’s not, and I’m stuck with it. 2. It gets “stuck” on literally nothing. It will be in the middle of the floor in an open area with nothing around it and start beeping SUPER loud. I try to reset it with the remote and it just keeps beeping. I have to literally pick it up and flip the power switch to get it to stop. 3. It has absolutely no pattern or logic to its movement. Just goes in random zig zags around my house, missing a ton of floor space. I have wanted a robot vacuum for awhile and was unsure which one to get. I wanted to make sure that I would be able to return whatever one I bought in case it didn’t work well, since they are so expensive, I didn’t want to risk spending hundreds of dollars on one and have it not work and then be stuck with it. So after one day of use, I was so frustrated with the stupid thing I wanted to throw it out the window. But instead, I boxed it back up and went to the order on Amazon to start the return. It then told me I needed to speak to customer service. So then I spent 20 minutes on the phone, getting transferred multiple times, only to eventually be told that this item is non-returnable. Which is funny because Amazon specifically says it is. NOT HAPPY. Biggest waste of $200 I ever spent.

B07R295MLS,1,"A toy, maybe, but not a real robo vac, maybe an early prototype","1) Its chamber to hold trash is tiny, may be suitable for a bathroom in Japan, but not any living area in an American home 2) It is blind and unintelligent so it wander about like a drunk rat and may not reach certain parts of the room at all. If you have furniture or other object it does not seem to wander *behind* them at all. 3) It is pretty low profile so I was exitied that it could go under our bed and pick up dust/dander, but it has no sensor to tell it might get wedged under something. Ours got wedged under kids' bed, under my wife's dressing table and once under a chair. It then beeps at you but if you are in another room you may not hear the beep and it will sit there until it runs out of juice. I had to go search for it a few times because it seemed to have vanished. 4) It is supposed to return to home base when done cleaning but I have no idea how it would know when it is done. We found that it would run out of power and just stop when cleaning a larger area. When we spot cleaned a part of the kitchen and asked it to return home it seems to take several attempts to find its base and then does not succeed in perching on the charger at the first attempt. Seems comical! 5) After a a few days, it now stops moving after 45 seconds even though it is fully charged. I am trying to return under warranty now. 6) It seems harder to clean the Eufy than to clean the house. Not a good buy, unless the replacement they send performs remarkably better.

B07R295MLS,1,Needs improvement,"I have had an iRobot for years and wanted another one for the upstairs. Saw the great reviews and decided to try this one. I was initially impressed because it was super quiet. However, I now understand the review that said it was like a toddler. It would run 30 seconds and get stuck under the recliner. I would go retrieve it and restart it and walk away, and 30 seconds later, it was stuck under the recliner. I would move it to a different room, and it would wander its way back to the other room within two minutes and be stuck again under the same recliner. I moved it again, so the recliner was not accessible and then it got stuck under the sofa. Then it was stuck on the Christmas tree stand. Then it was stuck on a rug. You catch my drift. I wanted a robot so I could let it do its thing without me having to do the work. Decided it is easier to run a regular vacuum cleaner or use my old iRobot because the new one doesn’t getting anything done quickly because it gets stuck everywhere. On a positive note, the dustbin is a lot bigger than my old iRobot. That would be really nice if it would actually run long enough to fill it up. The schedule feature is useless because it runs for 30 seconds and then it’s stuck somewhere.","Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2023"

B07R295MLS,1,ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MONEY,"I am not one to complain. I am also not one to write reviews. But I just had to write a 1 star review for this vacuum. I have been a long-time irobot roomba user. I have owned 3 of them. When my last roomba broke, I decided to give another company a try. This vacuum seemed to have good reviews, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I will also say that I basically use my robot vacuum as a glorified duster. I only run it on my 1000 sq ft first floor which consists of my kitchen, living room, and dining room. The entire floor is solid hardwood hickory. No carpet, no rugs. I live by myself and have 2 dogs, and I have a house cleaner that comes to clean my house twice per month. My point being, this is not used to CLEAN my floors. This vacuum is fired up twice per week to pick up the dog hair because I'm a neat freak. That's it. And it fails miserably. It DOES NOT PICK UP PET HAIR FROM A DRY HARDWOOD FLOOR. It picks up SOME of the hair, but only about 50% of the pet hair that it runs over. So I end up having to run it twice as often as my roomba, and there is still more pet hair on the floor than before. Battery life is extremely short. And having run it 9 times, it has failed to make it back to it's charging station on 3 of those runs before running out of power. I had to find it and place it back on the charger manually (in 3 of 9 times, or 33% of the time). HUGE waste of money.

B07R295MLS,1,Ridiculous,"This thing is ridiculous. I cannot not believe that it had such good reviews. It blows my mind that people are able to set this thing to go at night while they sleep or while they are at work. This thing requires more attention than my 2 year old toddler. It is constantly wedging itself under the refrigerator, under our recliner or getting stuck on a spot of uneven foot. I thought this thing was supposed to have detectors to help with that. This thing focuses on an area and nothing else. I swear I stick it in another room and it comes back is trying to “clean” this same dang spot again!! My house is not big. 1100 square foot maybe and not cluttered, this thing should be able to handle this house. I wish I would have spent the extra money to get one that maps the space. (I actually thought this one did, only realized after receiving that I read it wrong, but still figured it would be fine with our small house). I would not call this great for animal hair. It sucks some up but it also leaves a ton behind. I constantly clean it and it’s filter out. It only cleans random areas, leaving a ton of areas with dust and dog hair. I have had it about a week and now it goes for about a minute or two and then bumps into an open wall and starts beeping like there is an issue and then shuts off. It’s fully charged, canister is not full, filter is clean, and it has not sucked anything up it shouldn’t have. I just want to return it, but we already burnt the original packaging.

B07R295MLS,1,One of the Worst Consumer Products I Have Ever Purchased,"I absolutely disdain this robovac. I get right to the edge of just picking it up and throwing it away... every time it operates. I will certainly toss it soon. First some background, I had an iRobot robovac since 2015. It just worked. No issues and it was great to cover most of the vacuuming work where I just had to touchup every week or so. But it was getting old and louder so I saw this discounted Eufy and bought on a whim. Wow... night and day. This is an awful terrible crappy product. I can't leave it because it gets caught 3 to 5 times on every running and I have to go free it up. It winds itself up in my flat thin ""anchored"" throw carpet that never ever caused any problems with the iRobot. It gets stuck under the sofa for over an hour if I dont block all paths under the sofa. It slams up against everything... to the point that is pushes and often knocks over my plant stand. It got lost twice and ran out of battery power before finding it's charger. It covers the same path over and over and misses or barely covers other paths. I live in an uncluttered 1 bedroom apartment! This is not some crazy hard end-case for a robovac!! If this was my first robovac I would assume that the technology was crap and not worth spending any money on. However I know there are robovacs out there that work well. Heck 5 years ago there were ones that worked well. I just absolutely despise this product. As soon as I can justify paying for a new functional robovac - not from Eufy - I will toss this bugger in the trash.","Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2020"

B07R295MLS,1,Updated review after 9 months,"Updated review - Nov. 2021 - Used very infrequently and yet now it dies after 5 minutes of use and needs to be recharged. No longer sucks, I have cleaned it extensively to try to fix the issue but no luck. A totally waste of money. Original post - Feb. 2021: I have never owned a robot vacuum and didn’t know what to expect. I was able to figure out how to setup the vacuum with only a few glances at the instructions. Within one hour the vacuum was charged and ready to go. I hit the blue button and off it went. It lost one set of bristles because I failed to push then on until I heard a snap. I found the lost bristles later when it tried to suck them up. The vacuum pattern is erratic and often repeats its previous pass throughs. It’s a bit quieter than a traditional vacuum but not silent. After it visited every room once, I emptied the dustpan and there were plenty of debris. I cleaned off the lint from the roller brush and then set it back down and pushed the blue button and off it went. I believe it ran for over an hour and when it started to slow down the blue indicator light turned red. I selected the home button on the remote and it headed back to its base for the night. A few lessons learned: tidy up your cords or block them somehow, make sure all rug edges are lying flat, read about how to use the remote as there are a lot of buttons, and get ear plugs if you have a dog ... they will hate it.

B07R295MLS,1,This smart vac isn’t so smart...,"4th update: avoid this if you have stairs! I decided to buy a Roomba (i7) with the self emptying bin, and I love it. Since purchasing the Roomba, I decided to relegate this one to my second floor, but it’s struggling. The vac continues to get fooled by the stairs, falling and crashing to the bottom, ending up in pieces. I’m about to get another Roomba, which honestly, I like a lot better. 3rd update: once again, Eufy Support came through and walked me through the simple fix. Turns out it was my fault. Back up to 4 stars (but 5 stars for the amazing support). 2nd update: 8 months later and the Eufy seems dead (battery?). My roomba lasted for years, and this one lasted for 8 months. I won’t be buying another. Update: Eufy reached out and is working to help resolve the issues. Wonderful customer service. I wanted to love this, after reading the reviews, but it just didn’t live up to the hype. It’s navigation is pretty much blind, it struggles to find its home base, and it can’t handle stairs. Seriously, on the second day of use, it came crashing down a flight of stairs (see the attached photo). I had an older Roomba before this Eufy, and it suffered with none of those issues. I’ll be returning this and getting something with a bit more brains. On a positive note, it’s low profile meant that it could go where others could not.

I wish I would have sent it back but full time job, pregnant and a two year old, I have no brain power or energy for any “extras” like dealing with a broken vacuum. Anyway, after a week or ten days, one of the front brush gears got stripped so it wouldn’t really spin and it makes the vacuum really loud. It has gotten really stupid too. It no longer goes straight till it runs into something. Sometimes it will go three inches, turn 270 degrees, go three inches and do the same thing. It rarely makes it home, it doesn’t clean the whole space, and won’t go up on the throw rugs any more. I’m sad. I loved this product for a lot of reasons that all went to hell within 4 months. I’m sad that it only works minimally. I’m sad I won’t be able to use it when baby is here because it’s so loud. I’m sad I’m out $200. I’m extra sad that I’m going to have to spend a whole lot more money if I want one that is actually going to last. I say save your $$, buy the $500 or more version. I’ll be saving up because I NEED a robovac in my life, this one taught me that so I guess I can be thankful for it. However, I won’t be sad when it’s replaced.","Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2019"
B07R295MLS,1,Completely Useless,"I was hoping this would help me keep up with my two kittens who are tracking litter all over the house. My house has very smooth hardwood floors (recently refinished), and slate in the kitchen. Not only did the Eufy not pick up anything - I mean, not a thing - it moved around in a strange zig-zag motion and missing all the basic areas like corners and along the baseboards where dust and debris tend to collect. No matter which of the three suction modes it was in, it did not pick up anything. I've obviously taken it out of the box and used it. I don't know whether I can return it now. It is SUCH a huge wast of my time and money. So disappointed, and annoyed I believed the Wirecutter review.","Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2024"
B07R295MLS,1,Another Falsely Advertised Vacuum,"My fiance and I purchased 4 of these vacuums because they won the ""2018 robot vacuum award"" and were Amazon's choice. Unfortunately, we did not read enough of the product's reviews first. This was our second attempt at robot vacuums in order to replace the 4 Deenkee i7 vacuums we gave as gifts just this past December, 2018 (all only lasted 4-6 months). This vacuum advertises having ""infrared-sensor for evading obstacles, and drop-sensing tech to avoid falls"", to which we have experienced the exact opposite. This vacuum crashes into the same obstacles continually, falls into our shower (and then cant get out), and while testing it at my daughter's house, has fallen down the stairs as well. The vacuum has also stopped working at any given time - a few times we've found it sitting with nothing near or around it, completed turned off. Pressing the button got it going again, but we obviously had to return home to find it and press the button, so any time spent away from the house means no vacuuming. Lastly, I emailed the company about some of the issues we've experienced, and their answer back was ""it may be with your stairs configuration"". Seriously?! Are we the only one with stairs that have steps? They also asked for pictures, to which this issue I now know has already been documented by many owners of this vacuum, so asking for a picture (which would prove nothing) is just anther example of this companies lack of accountability for the issues we're experiencing. We have no choice but to send these vacuums back. We are not going to give these dysfunctional vacuums to family to replace the original dysfunctional vacuums.","Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2019"

But I wanted to try “the best” on the market. First, it was just ok. I think the Deebot and the Roomba are better at cleaning. Second, when it started going in circles uncontrollably, we reached out to their customer service. They recommended we purchase a part as that was the issue. Fine, we did. But that wasn’t the issue and it still wasn’t working properly. My husband spent hours looking online calling their customer service and when we asked if we could send it in for repair - they said that option didn’t exist and we’d have to buy a new one. We had it for 15 months - that’s CRAZY. I had my Deebot for 5 years and didn’t have that problem - just gave it yo a friend who needed one and we thought we’d “upgrade” to the Eufy. It was an absolutely horrible experience. My only recommendation - DO NOT PURCHASE. Go with the Deebot or the Roomba!!","Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2023"

B07R295MLS,1,Would like to punt it like a football,"I really loath this thing. At first it was great. We ran it every day. Not having to sweep daily was a novelty that me overlooking the fact the it missed major areas despite it running for what seemed like forever. Then we got lazy and forgot to put something blocking our fireplace one day and came home to huge scrathes in yhe finish ofnour hard floor after it apparently sucked up a lava rock and dragged it across the room and then got stuck on a rug. That leads me to getting stuck on a rug corner. While outside doing yard work we had it going and came back to it stuck on a corner of our rug, still running, leaving a huge black stain on our area rug. In addition it leaves more hair behind going up on top of rug edges then it picks up. What drives me nuts most of all is that it just bounces from spot to spot. It would have to run 5 hours to get the entire floor. And heaven forbid i leave a door open to the bedrooms. Either its gets stuck underneith the middle of the bed or gets stuck on something because i didnt properly prepare the room. 5 hours isnt doable considering the noise it makes and the fact that it requires adult supervision. And frankly having to constantly rearrange furniture and items around the house to make it less likely that this thia doesnt get stuck isnt worth it.

All three of them experienced the same issue. After approx 4 months of use, they would not function properly on any carpet surface. Light beige to the color carpet shown in video. They kicker is, all three units would work fine on hardwood or linoleum floors. I have a Sharp and I Robot units for over a year and both work great on carpets. However, the Eufy 11s cleans so much better than either of the others. With three dogs in the house - HAIR! Update -- Eufy is trying to say that all three units I sent back, had scratched bumper lenses. That is why they quit functioning properly. I want them to explain to me if the scratched lenses are the cause of the unit failure on carpet -- Why does all three units work correctly on non carpeted surfaces? Update-- 1/16/2019 / Eufy Anker has agreed to refund purchase price, including a prepaid shipping label. Also offered to send me a $40 item from their Amazon Store as a gift. Like I said, customer service is great. Also, I believe they actually have understood what I have been trying to say. Hope they fix the issue. I would buy again once the issue has been corrected.

Hair just gets stuck in every brush, it has no way to deal with hair aside from you having to clean it off brushes every time you use it. But most importantly, every single one of these has stopped working a year or less into use. My newest one just crapped out after 2 uses. They are just not high quality and that's why they're so inexpensive.

B07R295MLS,1,The vaccum roller brush has been giving us splinters in our feet,"We totally loved this vacuum at first. But something odd started happening... my wife, kiddo and I all very randomly started getting these very fine hair like splinters in our feet from time to time. Over the last 18 months these come up randomly and are usually easy enough to remove with a tweezers. I did take a decent amount of time searching my entire place looking for the source of these little fibers... which I never found. Today, my daughter had a pretty bad one that we could not remove. The vacuum just happened to have a dead battery right now, so I swept with a swiffer. At the end of my swiffering, I noticed hundreds of these little fibers! I finally had the thought ""I wonder if these are coming from that robo vacuum?"" So, I removed the rolling brush, pulled out one of the fibers to compare. 100% match! I called the company to tell them about the problem we have been experiencing and the rep told me that he had never heard of this happening before. I asked if they would please send me a replacement roller brush and they said NO! He, instead, told me to just buy one. This is an easy solution, but I feel that since I got a bad one originally, and my family has spent hours over the years getting these splinters out of our feet, Eufy should have just replaced it for us. If they reach out to me (after posting this review) I would be happy to remove this review.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2020"

Within a week i had to replace the battery (about 20 bucks) otherwise it would beep regularly. A little annoying but its taking sweeping and vaccuming off my to do list so i let it be. Well for the past 2 weeks or so every time it runs it wedges itself under my couch (which it does not fit under it legitimately has to wiggle back and forth to get under) and gets stuck, so stuck the couch has to be picked up to get it out. Tonight it went under the couch yet again and shredded up the carpet pad under the carpet (see picture). Being entirely over the situation and seeing so many positive reviews about the customer service i decided to give them a call to see if they had any suggestions. I was told that is just the way it is designed and i should block off underneath my couch so it cant get under there, which i did not feel was appropriate as it would look silly to have something underneath slightly elevated couches. So i asked about the return policy which is 30 days, well I'm way out of that window so the final suggestions was well just buy a new one that has a mapping feature.

B07R295MLS,1,"Not smart-just random movements, loud beep will wake you up, can't find home 1/2 the time","If you have a decent size house this will be frustrating. Since it's just random movement it's very inefficient in terms of coverage, instead of going up and down or side to side in a patterned movement it's totally random. So it will go over one place 5x but miss the spot 2 feet away. Cleaning other rooms requires that you constantly monitor and set up barriers otherwise the farther rooms either will not get visited or if it could spends a few minutes and gets out or spends a while and cleans it. It may come back or not. Like I said it's totally random. To best use it you should be awake and working from home or watching TV so you can direct it with the remote or put barriers and lead it to farther out rooms. Kind of takes away the advantage of the robot doing everything automatically. What is the purpose of the loud beep? Why can't it be disabled. Why does it need to beep when you change functions or when it goes back to the base? If you set it at night the beep is so loud it will wake you up. It's extremely annoying. Because it's random, finding it's way back home when it runs low on power is hit and miss. It returns home about 50% of the time, otherwise you will find it stuck somewhere. On the positive side it does pickup a lot of stuff and both sweeps and dusts. But the time you have to spend babysitting it, setting up barriers or directing it really defeats the purpose of having a robot vacuum. I returned it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2021"
B07R295MLS,1,The negatives trump the positives,"Play Video As you can hear it from the video the vacuum makes a very loud grinding noise randomly when operating. It still cleans hair and dust. The bin is always full. The loud grinding noise comes from inside the unit. When flipped I can’t see anything wrong and everything spins by hand as should. I think there’s a motor that’s slipping inside. It’s annoying as heck. If it wasn’t for this I’d give it 4 even 5 stars. Update: I contacted Eufy and they got back to me. At the end they finished the email conversation stating that since my purchase date is outside of their 12 month warranty period they won't do anything. ""Our team would like to help you but we are unable to make any repairs or replacements due to the warranty."" Not a suggestion as to what could the issue be, not a distant effort to make a customer happy. Nada. After the last review the vacuum sorta fixed itself or my cleaning the unit thoroughly helped with the grinding noise. It came back however and nothing helps at this point.

B07R295MLS,1,Only really worked for 6 months. Garbage.,"I purchased the eufy as a gift to myself for Christmas 2019. It only really worked for 6-7 months, and I’m kicking myself now for not reporting issues to the company then and getting a replacement. It would give me error messages at least once per cycle but I would just restart it and deal with it. It usually finished a job and made its way back to the charger. Well, at 13 months, after the warranty period, of course, it started only working for a few minutes at a time. (See video) Currently, it NEVER parks itself back on the charger, gets stuck on everything, only lasts a few minutes with a charge, etc. It’s useless garbage, unless you have the means to buy a new one every 6 months to a year. For reference, I had a Roomba 960 for years with only minor issues. Unfortunately, after 3ish years, the parts started getting too expensive to replace and I thought this would be a more economical solution. It had great reviews 🤔 and the parts are cheaper. The Roomba is far superior and worth the cost: it actually vacuums in a pattern (same pattern every time), it does more than 2-3 swipes before leaving a room, if it gave me an error there was usually a good reason, etc. The eufy will do 2-3 swipes in large rooms and waste all of the battery to do the same in a new room.

First of all, after a few months, the machine gets so loud that it’s irritating to have running while home. So we set it to run when we know we’ll be out of the house… but now it’s at a point that the device doesn’t register the correct time and it starts going at 1am (even when we have it set to go at noon!) I haven’t figured out a solution to that one because no matter what time we have it set to, it will spontaneously start in the middle of the night. It’s so loud we can hear it from the second floor. Not to mention we’ve had to replace the wheel because it randomly stopped working and customer service wouldn’t replace it. So yeah, used to love it, but unfortunately doesn’t last long. I feel bad for all the people who bought one on my recommendation :( Previous review: The Eufy vacuum is so effective and easy that we bought a second for our apartKent (our first is at our ski house up north). The price point is reasonable and the machine works really well - a lot quieter than my cousin’s roomba.

B07R295MLS,1,Please don't buy this vacuum!,"I've had this vacuum for about 8 months. I was never really impressed with the suction. It could go over a piece of leaf 2-3 times and never pick it up. It's really only good for very light weight, dust bunny sort of dirt. It just doesn't have the suction for anything more than that. So the fact that it doesn't really clean well was annoying enough but about 2 months ago it started making this god-awful noise that was so loud that you couldn't be within 2 rooms of it. I did a bunch of research and found that this is a common problem and that the brush roll eventually wears its housing down and because it doesn't fit properly, it makes this horrible noise. No worries though, to fix it you just need to find the exact right size of rubber band to wrap around the brush roll end before sitting back in its housing. Twist a thin rubber band ONLY ONCE, and no more or it won't work, around that end and pop it back into place. It must be replaced every week or two so make sure to stock up on the exact right size of rubber band to jimmy this stupid vacuum back to working order. You'll know when you need another one when your vacuum sounds like a freight train rolling through your room. *Insert eye roll here* Needless to say, it's a pain in the rear to fix especially since it's only a mediocre vacuum to begin with.","Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2020"

None of those things seemed to do the trick, but one day it just stopped. Now it will only vacuum for 5 minutes and then start beating obnoxiously just a few feet from where it started it’s journey (but inevitably far under the bed). The customer support is open only from 8-5 pacific time. And wouldn’t you know it, I have a job in an office and can’t be home to call in and have access to my vacuum to troubleshoot.

It's annoying to have to put things down to block the unit from places in which it will get stuck, but so be it. It's impossible to figure out its pattern of movement, because it doesn't have one. It appears to move randomly around the house, going over the same area several times and missing others entirely. Some reviewer aptly described these things as dumb as a bag of hammers. I would have given it four stars back then. In the last few weeks, though, it has started itself up at night. I thought I might have a start time programmed into the unit, so I checked this and found that there was no programmed start time. I took the batteries out of the remote just in case the problem was there. It wasn't. For a couple weeks, the thing started at 2:06 a.m., and I had to get up to shut it down. More recently, it has changed to 1:09 a.m. If I don't remember to turn it off at the switch on the underside, I will be getting out of bed.

B07R295MLS,5,"Very effective, reasonably priced.","The Euphy came highly recommended. We were not disappointed. It's quiet. It gets around obstacles pretty easily. It will get tangled with cords or thin curtains that reach the ground. It recognizes drop offs, like a step, and backs away. It was a good purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,"Quiet, Smart, and Efficient!","I’ve been using the Eufy Omni C20 for a couple of days now, and I’m super impressed! It’s incredibly quiet, so I can run it while working from home without any distractions. The slim design is a game-changer—it fits under my furniture effortlessly, cleaning places I never thought it could reach. What really stands out is how smart it is. The obstacle avoidance is spot-on, and it never gets stuck on cords or random objects. The suction power is strong enough to pick up dust, pet hair, and crumbs with ease, leaving my floors spotless every time. I also love the mopping feature—it’s not just a vacuum but a great combo device for hard floors. The only small downside is that it doesn’t have a self-emptying function, so I have to empty the dustbin after every use, but that’s a minor inconvenience for how well it cleans. If you’re looking for a quiet, efficient, and smart robot vacuum, the Eufy Omni C20 is absolutely worth it!","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,It does what it says it will do!!!,eufy Robot vacuum 11S is heavenly! Supersuction. Maneuverable when necessary. The suction and cleaning ability is unbelievable. The suction is TOO good (it even vacuumed up a toy fabric mouse of my cat's.) The cat -shorthair- watches it everywhere it goes. The suction is so good I find myself wondering how I could have ever vacuumed only 2-3 days a week! I have hardwood floors with the exception of one bedroom. Only two c/o: 1) The suction is so good eufy has to be emptied EVERY DAY. 2) It should have a handle to lift it from the floor when necessary to clean it.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024"

B07R295MLS,5,I like it alot,"This is my first one. My friends have them and they are loud and I didn't like that. This does get stuck like some people say and you have to find it but it is not the error of the vacuum, it is our problem for having low furniture that it gets stuck under. When it's lost it's almost always the same place, understand the low seat. This cleans very well. I havn't used the remote yet so I can't comment on that. When it's hits a corner it adjusts a tightly to try to go back in a straight line, but since no one lives in a box that means it's all over the place, again, not a fault of the vacuum. I like it ALOT. If it doesn't get stuck it finds ita way back to the base. I like the cutter that comes with it. We have long hair cats and I never knew how much they shed. The cutter allows you to zip down and cut It right off. I took off the wheel once to clean the sides and it is super easy. You open the bottom rectangle that holds the brush and take it out. That easy! I needed to do this because the long hair from the cats got in the side. It still worked, it was just my preference. My kids call it Eufey (oof-e). Where's Eufey???","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2024"

It has powerful suction and brush system and can tackle the most stubborn dirt and pet hair, leaving my carpets looking fresh. I was a bit unsure at first about how well a robot vacuum would manage different floor types, but the C20 has proven to be both adaptable and effective on both hardwood floors and carpets. What's more, the C20 comes with some smart features that make it easy to use. The intuitive app lets me schedule cleanings, track the vacuum’s progress, and control it remotely.

B07R295MLS,5,Perfect vacuum,"I recently upgraded to the eufy Robot Vacuum Omni C20, and it has truly transformed my cleaning routine. The all-in-one station is incredibly convenient, with features like auto emptying, washing, and drying. The transparent water tanks are a thoughtful touch, making it easy to keep an eye on water levels without any hassle. One of the standout features is its ultra-slim 3.35-inch design, which allows it to clean under furniture and in tight spaces that are usually hard to reach. This has significantly reduced the amount of manual cleaning I need to do. The 7,000 Pa suction power is impressive, easily picking up dirt, crumbs, and pet hair. However, I did notice that its performance can vary slightly depending on the type of flooring and the amount of dust. The Mop Master Technology is another highlight, with its 180 rotations per minute and 6N of pressure making quick work of tough stains. The dual sweeping and mopping modules are a great addition, allowing for simultaneous cleaning and maximizing efficiency. One minor downside is that the Pro-Detangle Comb, while effective, requires occasional manual intervention to remove very stubborn hair tangles. But overall, this is a small price to pay for the convenience and thorough cleaning the C20 provides. In summary, the eufy Robot Vacuum Omni C20 is a fantastic investment for anyone looking to simplify their cleaning routine. Its powerful suction, slim design, and advanced mopping technology make it a standout choice. Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,"Great vacuum, especially if you can get it on sale!","We bought this because I didn't have time to sweep our LVP floors every day after the kids dropped all their crumbs everywhere. It is amazing! You can set it on a timer so it goes off at the same time each day, or just turn it on when it works for you. It's been able to sense our stairs just fine and has never fallen down them, doesn't scuff up walls or furniture. Sometimes my spouse says the vacuum struggles to find the docking station after vacuuming, but I've never noticed (though there have been times where it's seemed lost, but with a little patience it always finds the right way to go). It's great for hard floors, not so much rugs/carpet. It'll go on rugs, even our high pile rug, but it isn't able to get anything off of them and it gets stuck (on the high pile rug. On the low pile rug it's never had a problem). The thing I love most about this is that it's short enough to fit under our couches, bedframe, dresser, etc and you will be disgusted by how much dust/dirt it picks up during that first vacuum. We had to empty the tray several times that first day, but now I empty it about once a week or so. We usually run it every day.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"

Aspectos a mejorar: 1 - A veces la aplicación no envía de forma rápida las configuraciones de operación a la aspiradora. 2 - Por alguna razón cuando está en modo trapeador cuando regresa a la base no logra subir del todo y no logra acomodarse a pesar de que no hay obstáculos.

B07R295MLS,5,Pet Owner's Dream: The C20 Vacuum Review,"As a pet owner, I've struggled to find a vacuum that can keep up with the constant shedding and mess. But after using the C20 vacuum, I'm thrilled to say that my search is over. This vacuum is a game-changer for me because it can effortlessly remove pet hair from carpets, leaving them looking like new. I've tried countless vacuums in the past, but none have come close to the C20's performance. Besides this, it also works universally well on other surfaces (e.g. hardwood floors, tiles, etc) and does an awesome job removing all the dust/debris. The ease of use also really sets C20 apart from previous vacuum robots I owned. Setting it up was a breeze, and the intuitive interface makes it easy to get started. I can quickly switch between modes, adjust suction power, and schedule cleanings with just a few taps on the app. It's simple enough that even my non-tech-savvy family members can use it without any issues. Comparing C20 to my current iRobot S9+ which is more expensive and various other sorts like Roborocks, I think it's much more powerful, picking up dirt and debris with ease. Plus, the navigation system is far superior, allowing it to expertly map out your space and avoid obstacles. The app also seems to have more support that looks frequently updated. In short, the C20 vacuum is a must-have for any pet owner or homeowner looking for a reliable, efficient, and easy-to-use cleaning solution. I think I will stick to it for a long time.","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2024"

B07R295MLS,5,"Efficient, Sleek, and Hands-Free Cleaning for Smaller Spaces","Play Video I live in an 800 sqft condo with mostly hardwood floors and a few small rugs, and the Eufy Omni C20 has proven to be a great fit for my space. Here’s a breakdown of my experience with the vacuum: 1. Ease of Use The Omni C20 is incredibly easy to set up. After plugging it in and filling the water tank, I was good to go. The water tank is very user-friendly, with a convenient handle and a well-sealed cover that prevents leaks, which is a common issue with some competitor models. The ambient light under the water tank adds a cool visual touch, making the vacuum feel a bit more premium. 2. Lidar/Proximity Sensor Upgrade The lidar and proximity sensors on this model are a major improvement over other robots I’ve used. Coming from the Eufy X8 and Dreame D10 Plus, both of which had solid lidar systems, I’ve noticed the Omni C20 maps my apartment much more efficiently. In my previous models, the first mapping session could take 20-30 minutes, and the robots didn’t always distinguish between walls and furniture. The Omni C20, however, only takes about 3 minutes to complete the initial mapping and does a 3D scan, accurately identifying solid walls from furniture like countertops. Very impressive! 3. Sleek Design and Low Profile While the lidar sensor is much improved, what really stands out is the Omni C20’s sleek design. Unlike my previous robots, which had a visible sensor bump on top (think of the lidar sensors on autonomous cars like Waymo), the Omni C20 has a slim, almost Tesla-like profile. The entire body is only about 3 inches tall, allowing it to easily go under tight spaces like couches and cabinets. I’m not sure how Eufy managed to achieve this, but it’s a big plus for anyone with limited clearance. 4. Good Surface Detection and Nice Cleaning Performance with a small trade off The C20 does a great job of differentiating between surfaces. It switches seamlessly between mopping and vacuuming when it detects a change in floor type, even when it comes to something as small as a door mat. Its cleaning performance is impressive, though it’s not the fastest robot out there. On average, it takes about 1 minute per 10 sqft for a combined mop-vacuum cleaning session. For comparison, my Dreame D10 does the job almost twice as fast. However, the C20 delivers superior cleaning results and even goes back to wash the mop during the cleaning cycle, which contributes to the longer duration but is a great feature. I’m happy with the trade-off since the C20 offers a more thorough clean. 5. Ok Battery Life and Long Charging One of the few drawbacks I’ve noticed is the battery life. It’s not the best in its class. On average, the C20 uses about 60% of its battery to clean my entire 800 sqft apartment. By contrast, my Dreame D10 only uses about 30% for a similar cleaning. The C20 also has a slower charging time, taking over 3 hours to fully recharge. However, given its smaller profile and ability to clean tighter spaces, I’m okay with the trade-off. 6. Mop Drying Noise Another small concern is that the robot produces a low, constant noise for a few hours while it dries the mop after cleaning. While it doesn’t use hot air drying like some competitors, it’s a more energy-efficient approach. This isn’t a major issue for me since it’s part of the self-sustaining, hands-free cleaning process. I’m happy to let it do its job and dry, charge, and clean itself without any intervention from me. Conclusion Overall, the Eufy Omni C20 offers a fantastic hands-free experience with impressive cleaning performance and thoughtful design. While it’s not the fastest in terms of cleaning time or battery life, the superior mapping, sleek profile, and thorough cleaning make it well worth the investment. If you have a smaller space, like a studio or a 1-3 bedroom condo, this is a great robot vacuum to consider. However, if you have a larger home and need longer battery life, you might want to explore other options, especially bigger ones. For me, it’s been a great fit, and I’m very happy with the results.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Love it!,I was doubting on getting this one because it has just one brush and my old one had two. But i have to say it really does the job with just 1 brush.

B07R295MLS,5,Excellent value and performance,"Upgraded our Eufy G40+ to this at the Black Friday discounted price - OUTSTANDING. I've wanted an ""active"" robot mop for years (vs the G40+ which was just a pad that the unit wet, kinda like a swiffer), and this one is just the ticket: * it is a steal at that price. I was debating it vs the X10 and have zero regrets going with the C20. Time will tell reliability etc, but customer service with Eufy in the past has been good. *Lidar is on the front vs top - mapping and navigation are excellent *it is slightly louder running than the G40 it replaces, but when it ""empties"" at the base station it is quieter (emptying thr vac is still loud, but it is less loud, and only a few seconds). ""Mop washing"" is about the same as a dishwasher or washing machine and only lasts a couple of minutes. The fan to dry the mop is not loud at all. *fits under our sofa easily *Cleaning comb works GREAT on our dog's long hair - some hair at the bearings end but very little on the roller itself. *base station is smaller then other mop vacs (that's good for us as we have limited space) *The filthy water coming out of the dirty tank makes it clear it's mopping well! *mop pads are dried with cool air. Some may not like that, but we're not bothered (no different than using a manual mop). It's not particularly loud. *obstacle avoidance is fine for us - it's not bumping furniture and has rolled around any large pieces in the floor. *it is doing astonishingly well for us on edges and in corners - much better than it's predecessor. *suction is crazy good. We usually run a vacuum on max, but I can run this on the lowest setting and still get a better clean than previous models we've had. Even with our hairy dogs and all the mess they track in and leave behind this thing got all the dirt and leaves other vacs have left behind. Very very happy with it after a week of heavy use - it's pretty good value at its regular price, but on sale this Black Friday week it's ridiculous value!","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2024"

B07R295MLS,5,LOVE THIS VACUUM,"This is the greatest deal you can find. I have had this since July. It works exactly as it says it does. Nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. I have a long haired dog and two long hair cats so there is lots of pet hair. I empty it every day and it is always crammed full. When I do use the regular vacuum on my 1000 sq. ft main floor, I am amazed how little hair and dirt I pick up. You wouldn't think to watch it that it has picked up so much. Two things to remember-first, it isn't going to map your house, it is going to get stuck, but it goes back to work and keeps at it. I use the remote a lot to direct it, but that's easier than getting out the big vacuum. Battery charging is great. I can usually run it two times a day. The second thing is you must clean it, but it is very easy. I dump the tray every day and use a big, soft paint brush to clean the tray and filter. I remove the filter and knock the dirt out of it as well. The brush is easy to take out and clean. I bought extra filters, edge cleaners, and brushes. They are very reasonable. This makes it easy to insert a clean part and wash the the brushes and filters and let them dry. The edge cleaner brush does get destroyed but it is so easy to buy and change out, it is not a problem. It plays a big role in sweeping up the hair. The suction is enough to leave marks on the rugs. Goes from hard wood to carpet easily, does not fall down steps, and goes back to home base. I had purchased another one with all the bells and whistles including mopping etc. only to hear from friends all the trouble they had with them. Returned that one unopened and bought this one. I am very happy with it.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

This unit is ideally suited for my house which has all laminate floors with low profile rugs without fringe. I just purchased another of the same model because I’m afraid the technology will change. This is a simple, very effective, low profile unit which is easy to maintain, change filters, brushes etc. I have 2 large dogs in a 700 sq foot house at the beach and I hate dog hair.

B07R295MLS,5,very impressive vacuum,"I never thought I would want a robot vacuum, but I decided to try one to see if I could keep on top of my floors better with a bit of help. This model had great ratings, and the price was reasonable, so I decided to give it a try. I was so surprised at the amount of debris it removed from my floors. I have since ordered 2 more so I can have one on each floor. Simple to set up and use. I spend a few minutes making sure there is nothing that could be tipped over or get caught up and then turn it loss. Love it. Highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Amazing little guy,"Had looked for quite a while for a robotic vacuum. Smallish floorplan, mix of low pile area rugs and hardwood floors. Really didn't want to spend $500 on a robotic vacuum. Eufy (which I understand is a subsidiary of Anker, a brand I really like) had this robotic vacuum for $249 with a $100 coupon. I figured I couldn't go wrong for $149. I am glad that I bought it. It's fairly basic, no wifi, minimal bells and whistles, but boy, it does a great job getting into all the nooks and crannies on our first floor. I run it daily on the half hour cycle, and evidence that it is working is apparent when I empty the dust tray. Wow. Incredible the amount of dust, dog hair, and small debris that this thing grabs. The route it takes around the floor plan seems totally random, but it does seem to cover the entire space over the course of two half hour cycles. That coverage and rate of pick up is satisfactory for me. At the end of the half hour cycle it returns to its base and recharges. Emptying the dust tray is manual, which is fine for me, given what I saved on the purchase. Plus I'm always curious what it picked up in its travels. Overall, very happy with my decision to go with this brand and model.","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024"

It is trulty amazing just how ""smart"" this vacuum is...it vacuums up ALL messes, wet or dry, and returns to the home station to ""auto-empty"" before going back out to clean some more! It comes ready to go right out of the box, and works like a charm with two small exceptions. The vacuum can have a little trouble cleaning tight corners, and he battery could be a bit longer lasting. That said, it is programmed to return to the home station when it's low, so it doesn't just stop in the middle of a cleaning run. Five stars.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

B07R295MLS,5,Quiet but powerful,"This little machine is awesome! I have been shocked at how much dust the Eufy picks up every time I use it! I call it Georgina, my new cleaning lady that only does floors. Seriously, this robo vac easily goes under all the furniture, which has become difficult for me with back issues. The vac has no problem detecting the stairs and gently bumps into furniture and changes direction. Because of the layout of my house, I have been blocking off rooms and let her clean two at a time or close the bedroom doors and let her go for 45 minutes to an hour in each. This way I know each room is getting vacuumed. Because of this, I don't use the scheduling feature, although I did use it the first few times and it worked fine. I like how she hugs the baseboards and gets close to corners. I have hardwood with area rugs and tile in the kitchen and foyer. Eufy easily goes from one floor type to the other, going over the saddle separator. I had hesitated getting a robo vac because I was concerned the brushes and wheels might scratch the wood floors. My concern was unfounded because the brushes are soft and the wheels are rubber and gentle on the floors. Eufy is very quiet yet the suction is great. I am always amazed at how much dust is in the bin, and I've been running it just about every day. I would say it's picking up just about as well as the upright. If you unblock the rooms, Eufy robo vac will find its way back to the charging station on her own when she needs to recharge. I am so glad I treated myself to this - it was definitely worth it!","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

B07R295MLS,5,Did not see it coming.,"I really did not expect to like this vacuum as much as I do. Let me explain. Have several other brand robot vacuums that I am very happy with. Our floors have never looked better. Due to architectural features of our very old house one small area needed a separate vac (either that or me with a handheld one). For a period of time this little veranda was cleaned daily by a semi-retired other brand vacuum but its battery was aged and it was time for a replacement. It is not a heavy traffic area but the cat litter robot is there as are several large potted plants. This little Eufy simply blew me away by what it manages to pick up! As I already explained, the area was by no means neglected (cleaned daily as a matter of fact!). But amount of pet hair (both dogs' and cats') this thing was gathering every time is simply mind boggling. I am also extremely impressed with how close to the edges Eufy is able to clean. It is very quiet, works efficiently, has a good size container and terrific suction. The things that I do not like are: this model does not self-empty, the cleaning pattern is haphazard instead of a methodical grid, does not send a ""help me"" message if stuck. But ALL of these negatives are outweighed by the quality of cleaning and extremely reasonable price. Even though there is no app, cleaning schedule was very easy to set up (it did not switch to daylight savings time automatically but this did not bother me). This model is quite slim, so it easily gets under the low furniture. I never dealt with Eufy brand before but now will absolutely consider their products. When it is time to replace our smarter self-emptying vacuums I might check out Eufy's offers first. Wonderful little vacuum, simply love it.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"

I works great for the time period but starts getting expensive. I think i have bought 4 of the the 11s. Purchased the model expecting it to be the same but have removed the left side sweeper on the model and it is a really bad model. With only one sweeper it will not leave a room you have to stop it take it to another room then do the same. I would not purchase this model ever again and my advise is to stay away from it. Not worth the time or money. Have nothing against Eufy might try another model but the engineers have ruined the 11s again not worth buying.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024"
B07R295MLS,5,Impressed!,"This is my first robot vacuum so I don't have much to compare it to; however, I gave it a tough job that I struggle to keep up with and it worked fantastic. I have a long haired dog who sheds non-stop and it was able to handle a week's worth of dust puppies and detritus with only being emptied and cleaned once. That brings me to the second part. Whoever designed this thing gets it. All brushes are removable for cleaning and a tool is provided to do such. The roller brush pops out to remove long stands of hair or string and the feeding brush pops off to remove tangles. It's easier to maintain than my regular vacuum, but I guess that is the point. As it ages I'll update based on wear and tear but it was a worth while purchase and I highly recommend it.

The gaskets that seal the filter & vacuum system are still soft and seal like new. The floor travel pattern is perfect. It will wrap around chair legs to clean all around.

I’m an older woman who is usually challenged by something new like this, but I did fine. This is a very simple machine that won’t spy on you. It won’t send back a report that says you need a new couch. The only shortcoming is that, like other robot vacs, this takes quite a while to get the sweeping done. The Eufy is quieter than my microwave. My dogs were a little curious but weren’t upset when it started moving around on the floors. The dirt bin and the 3-in-1 filter are both washable.

But I’d rather do some spot touch ups than push a vacuum thru the entire house and then mop. It enables me the opportunity to clean the floors more frequently, and that is totally worth it to me. It is quite amazing to watch it work. And I’m very happy with how it works. I’ve already been recommending to friends. I learned that if you have a large open area, like a kitchen/family room open concept, it is much better to divide up the room, and have it clean one area at a time…Especially if you want to move chairs into the other area not being worked on, so it can just run without trying to work around chair legs.

My shark after two years had a one piece rap where the front bumper was, which now meets in the middle, bowing like it is two pieces. Anyway, I have hope the C20 is less janky. Only time will tell.

It does very well going from carpet to wood floors to tile. There is a height difference between the wood floors and the tile and it manages to climb it well enough without getting stuck.

B07R295MLS,4,Eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX: A Dependable Cleaning Companion!,"The Eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX has truly impressed me with its sleek, compact design. Its super-thin profile of just 2.85 inches allows it to easily glide under furniture, and the black finish fits perfectly with my home decor. The build quality feels solid and durable, balancing lightweight design with sturdiness. Performance Suction Power: The powerful suction capability of 1300Pa is a standout feature. It effectively picks up dirt, dust, and pet hair from both hard floors and medium-pile carpets. The BoostIQ technology is especially helpful, automatically increasing suction when transitioning onto carpets for a more thorough clean. Cleaning Efficiency I’ve found that the 11S MAX navigates spaces efficiently, using systematic cleaning patterns. It transitions smoothly between different floor types and has sensors that help it avoid obstacles and prevent falls. Noise Level One aspect I appreciate is how quiet it operates. Compared to other vacuums I've used, the 11S MAX runs at a significantly lower noise level, which makes it perfect for daytime cleaning without disturbing anyone in the house. Battery Life and Charging With a battery life of around 100 minutes, this vacuum covers my medium-sized home comfortably on a single charge. When the battery runs low, it automatically returns to the charging dock, which is incredibly convenient. App Connectivity and Features While it doesn’t offer advanced app features found in more premium models, the remote control is straightforward and user-friendly. It allows for manual operation and scheduling, although I do wish it had Wi-Fi connectivity for smart home integration. Maintenance and Cleaning Maintaining the 11S MAX has been relatively hassle-free. The dustbin is easy to remove and clean, and the washable filters help save on costs. The brushes do collect hair and debris, but they detach easily for cleaning. What I Like 1. Powerful Suction: The vacuum effectively picks up dirt and pet hair from various surfaces. 2. Quiet Operation: It runs quietly, allowing for use during the day without disruption. 3. Compact Design: Its slim profile makes it easy to clean tight spaces. 4. Automatic Charging: It returns to the dock when the battery is low, ensuring it’s always ready for use. 5. Ease of Maintenance: Simple dustbin and brush cleaning processes make upkeep easy. What I Don’t Like 1. Limited Smart Features: It lacks Wi-Fi connectivity and advanced app features for remote control and scheduling. 2. Obstacle Navigation: Occasionally, it gets stuck on high thresholds or low furniture, though this doesn't happen frequently. 3. Dustbin Capacity: The dustbin is on the smaller side, requiring more frequent emptying, especially with pets around. Overall Experience Overall, the Eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX has provided a reliable cleaning solution for my home. Its impressive suction power and quiet operation make it a great addition to my cleaning routine. While it may not have all the high-tech features of pricier models, it delivers solid performance at a reasonable price. I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a dependable robotic vacuum for daily cleaning tasks.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,Pleasantly Pleased,"Good job of vacuuming, quiet, easy to empty and returns to base to recharge. I have small area 1250 sq ft. Takes about 2 - 2 1/2 hrs to vacuum. Doesn’t seem to map, as different path is taken, but similar. As long as si keep my birds up out if the way, it doesn’t get hung up anywhere. I’ve ran it everyday for this first week to see if it will map. I don’t have pets. I’m pleased so far.","Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2024"

B07R295MLS,4,"Overall good, but gets stuck often","Play Video We have had this vacuum for over a year and overall really like it. It does pick up an amazing amount of dirt that you didn’t even know was there. The bin is relatively small and probably can only handle about three days worth of dirt depending on if you have animals or not. It gets stuck quite often on the legs of the recliners so I had to build guards for it to bump against and not try to climb up. It finds its way back to the base, 8/10 times. The battery lasts about 1.5 hours of cleaning. It does not have any sort of online mapping or anything like that just a remote that is somewhat programmable. Overall, I would buy this again for what I paid for it but now there are other options that are in the same price range that have the automatic dust removal bin, mop, and other options.","Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,Third Try. great!,"I tried and returned 2 vacuums before this one: the XIE bro (vacuum/mop) which couldnt go over thresholds) and Lefant M310 which had no roller brush. This one is a step up! +Climbs over thresholds and carpet edges with bigger wheels. (Specs say .63 inch) +Gets itself out of being stuck in corners edges +recommend this model with higher power and suction + good on both carpet and floor + no need to attach to internet! Less cost, functionality overkill in my opinion + long battery, keeps cleaning +/- Remote helpful and fun to direct unit direction, set up auto start time, suction and settings (but doesnt always work). +/- self docking (but doesnt always work) - only one spinning sweeper brush. They say it cleans the same but i watch it fling dirt away from cleaning path. - a little loud esp at highest suction setting - it is a given that you need to clean roller brush and empty after each use but worth it for price.","Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2024"

B07R295MLS,4,It just sucks. (That's a good thing.),"This isn't exactly a high-IQ little vacuum -- it gets stuck under chairs and recliners and has to be rescued sometimes -- but it cleans like crazy and sucks up all the little hairs and food crumbs you can't even see on a hardwood floor. Not self-dumping, but when I open it up to clean it out I can't believe how much is in there. It's quiet, and fun to watch, and it keeps our main floor noticeably cleaner. Besides, we got it on Prime day for $129, so what's not to love? We might even buy another one for our carpeted upstairs bedrooms.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"
B07R295MLS,4,"Sleek, quiet and slimmer than my Roomba","I have a Roomba. The battery is failing. It's been great so I was looking for another. This Eufy was half the price of the cheapest Roomba and it was pretty well reviewed so I thought I'd give it a shot. It arrived packaged very well, documents were ok, set up was easy. Here's what I found. It's quiet so I can be in the same room when it's doing its' job. It's slim so it gets under things the Roomba doesn't. It's great on hard floors, ok on carpet but not as good as the Roomba on deep pile. It gets stuck where my Roomba gets stuck under the sofa but additionally has an issue with the base of my tower fan when the Roomba doesn't. It isn't connected to Wifi but that doesn't bother me. I have too many smart devices anyway and the Eufy has a remote that works well. So far the coolest thing is that when you order it home, it stops vacuuming and silently (well almost) speeds up looking for its' kennel. Oh yes it takes quite a while to charge. At least a couple of hours. But that charge lasts way longer than my Roomba - in fact it lasts for ages (I tried to time exactly how long but it was so long I got bored waiting for it to finish). So that's it; 4 stars. I'd give it 5 if it never got stuck and was better on carpet.","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2024"

B07R295MLS,4,"Changed the design, not as good","Unfortunately they have changed the design. Instead of two rotating spiral side brushes in front pushing dirt and animal hair towards the main suction brush there is only one. Also, the filter used to have the filter and a thing sponge layer to trap small dust particles which could be removed and cleaned, now the filter cannot be removed and the thin sponge is no longer there. I guess you could wash the filter, but obviously the design is to get you to buy replacement filters. I'll update once I used it to see if it works the same, however I mostly use it for cat hair and the two spiral side brushed were great at grabbing it and diverting to the main brush. Disappointed to say the least! Update Review a week later - the vaccuum cleans very well with the new design. I do wish the filter included the sponge fron the original design, but overall I am pleased and use it every day. For the price of this little vaccuum it does a great job on animal hair.

Sorta OK on the thin rug. Very little picking up on the thicker oriental rug. But then thicker rugs/carpet has never been the robot vacuums’ forte.

B07R295MLS,4,Positvely Perfect Robo-Vacuum/Mop Combo,"Call me lazy or just simply a person who likes to get things done efficiently, this robot vacuum and mop has quite literally saved me so much time, due to these standout features: - Setup is extremely easy and the included manual is illustrated, which allows for a straight-forward process to get this device running. - The quality of sweeping and mopping provided by this product is extremely thorough and rivals if you were to do it by hand. - Pricing for this innovative gadget is currently at $500+, which is pretty steep and isn't something the general population can afford. Everything this device has to offer is top-notch and well designed by the creators, with 1-star deducted for an escalated price-tag that most definitely classifies this item as a luxury item.

Because it is not connected to an app, it just bounces off of walls and whatever it runs in to. I actually like that it is not connected to Wifi because I think we could all use a little less technology in our lives lol. The only thing I don't love about it, is that you have to pick up every little thing that it could run over. I have to pick up my cats food and water because it will plow over it and knock it over.

B07R295MLS,4,"Eufy 11S ""Max"" is a filter nightmare!!","The Eufy 11S Max is a joke!! Beware the filter system!! The filter on the 11S MAX gets clogged EVERY time you use it and it takes a while to clean it. Pretty labor intensive for every day use, If you will look at the filters, not only are they smaller than the 11S, they also have a plastic casing that makes the usable filter less effective. I am so disappointed I didn't realize this in time to return it. If you look at the 11S it has a screen over the filter to keep dirt from clogging the filter and a foam pad behind the filter to provide further filtration. This is the filtration system I had on previous robo vacs that worked so well. You would think the ""Max"" would provide something more than the 11S but its definitely inferior. The only ""max"" I see is their profits on these machines! I feel like the feedback on these must have included 11S. I'm chalking My ""Maxes"" (I bought two) up to live and learn and getting a couple of 11S model instead. Lot less labor intensive, Update: While I still feel my assessment of the 11S Max was accurate , my presentation was a little harsh. I was contacted by the seller and offered a full refund or a different model vacuum. My feedback is influenced a lot by the response of the seller. They were very apologetic and did offer two solutions. That means a lot in my book, when a company stand by their product, and that isn't the standard. Eufy does make excellent machines and they stand by their products. This one just happened to have a substandard filter system. Hopefully that will be addressed in future models.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

B07R295MLS,4,"Still New, Works Great, Must Have App To Use, Needs More Instructions & Dustbin Notifications","We're really impressed with this little guy, but first a few issues to know about if you're new to robot-vacs (like we are): This machine includes no remote control -- which I was hoping to get -- but instead only works with a phone app. I'm not a fan of apps at all, especially when you have to depend on connectivity when you need to use an appliance or tool that should work even without a connection. You also must have the internet to read the manual to figure out how to use it. There's a ""startup"" guide included on a piece of cardboard, but that's just for setup, not usage. I would prefer even a short usage manual to read through before I have to log in to use it. I'd love it more if it used a remote rather than my unreliable cell phone & WiFi! Second, while it's great with notifications and locating the unit, it's not very comprehensive. For example, when I used the vac the first time (after it ""mapped"" my house), it started lagging a lot and not working too well. After an hour of investigating and not seeing any alerts or instructions, I accidentally found out I had to empty the vac's bin. This was nowhere in the setup or usage instructions, and no alerts at all that it was full. It's still new, and I may run into more unforeseen issues (which I'll update here if I do), but beyond that we're pretty happy with this thing. We haven't used the mop feature, only the vac, so I can't speak to that part. It took 41 minutes to vacuum 3 rooms before it got down to 23% battery and docked itself to recharge, and it did a good job even in corners and crevices. It took about 6 hours to recharge to 100%. I do recommend that you read all the instructions & reviews that you can for tips & precautions. This will suck up things you don't want it to, so be sure you clear the floors of cables & stringy things, including rug or blanket fringes, before setting the vac loose. And don't forget to check the dustbin in the vac often, now that you know about it. :) I'm giving this 4 stars because it does a much better job than I expected, despite the issues I mentioned above. It's quieter than my push vac, and my cats quickly went from being terrified of it to very curious about it and no longer afraid. We're already so fond of this vac, we're talking about sticking some googly eyes on it and naming it! lol If you have any questions, ask away, and if your question reaches me I'll do my best to answer what I know. I'll definitely be back here to update if anything notable happens with it as I continue to use it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2024"

B07R295MLS,4,I usually only get about one year out of these. But they work well and the overall cost is good.,"The 11s works very well for us for pet hair on 1200 sq ft of hardwood floors. It fits well under all our furniture and it's charging base is easily hidden. So, overall they are a huge help. It always amazes me how much hair our little dog produces in a day. The ""con"" is that we typically only get about a year out of these. We run it daily and my family is not great about picking up socks and other things that can get sucked into it, so we are probably pretty hard on them. But I've purchased more expensive brands in the past and they don't seem to last that much longer (lots of moving parts that can fail) and they typically cost much more.

B07R295MLS,4,Works really well.,"Pro: My first robot vacuum. I love that it does not connect to the internet. There is no good reason for an appliance to connect to the internet. It cleans well. Has cut way down on the daily sweeping chore. I really like that it goes under the furniture (most of my furniture). Easy to empty and I do so when it occurs to me and is convenient to do so. It has yet to ""ask me"" to be emptied. I probably do it once a week or so when doing other chores. Quietest vacuum I've ever had (though also the smallest). Con: Doesn't get all the way into the corners, so one has to weep the corners out once in a while. Can get stuck under some furniture (in my case where I have a tapered toe kick board under a book case that it can sometimes wedge itself into). Has problems with electric cords and strings. Keep your space picked-up (just like Mommy told you to (in fairness, one has to do that for a regular vacuum as well)). As it moves randomly, it can take some time to vacuum a space thoroughly.","Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2024"

B07R295MLS,4,Works well but has a few drawbacks,"I’ve used this product for a couple weeks now and I’ll start by saying that it is worth its money and does a decent job. Would I purchase it again…not sure at this point. But I wouldn’t say I’m dissatisfied with it. The drawbacks are: It does not have a handle to pick it up with which seems trivial but that’s an inconvenience to me. The only function without the remote is start/stop using the button on the vacuum itself so to run a spot clean, for example, you have to pick up the remote. It struggles with some clay cat litter on tile or slick floors and will scatter it. And there is no option for a room divider/wall barrier device. Some pros are that it is really quiet, low profile is great, and it will work on a rug with some black in it. All in all it is fine for what I use a robot vacuum for.","Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2024"

B07R295MLS,4,Handy vacuum,This was a great price for a vacuum. It was a bit horrifying how much it picked up the first few times I used it. It is low enough to go under the couches and can get over small obstacles. I really wish it had something to stop it getting stuck though. It has gotten partly under an arm chair and a wall unit and then got itself wedged. I've learned to tip the chair up and block the bottom of the wall unit and then it's fine. It's also gotten stuck on a floor vent. It's pretty quiet and unobtrusive and does a great job of cleaning. It doesn't have a big compartment so has to be emptied fairly often. It takes a while to fully charge back up. Overall I'm very pleased with it as it saves me a lot of work. It would be 5 stars except for having to block things off where it will get stuck.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024"

B07R295MLS,4,Not impressed/edit: it's ok,"I've only had it for one day. I set the timer for 7:00 in the morning, I was at work when it ran. Came home on lunch and it was stuck. After getting it unstuck and blocking off the path to where it couldn't go that way I restarted it. Ended up with a dead battery underneath the bed not hung up on anything. It is relatively quiet, but it is a vacuum after all so it's not totally quiet. It seemed to pick up quite a bit of the animal hair off the parts of the floor it did vacuum. I was under the impression that you could use an app with this one but you can't. It does come with a remote that is relatively easy to learn. I'm hoping that the next few days he makes it back to his charger without having to be placed there and actually cleans. If not I'm going to have to return him and find a different one. Edit: For the last 10 days it's made it to it's charging base with the exception of getting high centered on cords a couple of times. It's seems to get the floors cleaned, the trash receptacle needs emptied every couple days. We have a dog and a cat so plenty of hair to clean up. It's still kinda quiet.","Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2024"

B07R295MLS,3,It's ok - not magic,"I will start this off by saying that I have laughed at the thought of these vacuums. We have 2 newfoundlands, a malamute/shepherd mix, 2 cats, and 4 humans in this house. My Dyson pet vac? Lasted a year. The Shark pet vac? Also a year. I have never been under the assumption that this kind of vacuum would work in my house. I was right. Duh. However.....we bought this because it was half off and we enjoy cute gadgets. We thought that maybe, if we ran it every day, that it could pick up a little bit and my regular vacuuming wouldn't be such an emergency situation every few days. I think it actually has helped a little bit! It definitely picks up some stuff and my regular vacuuming has not struck me as an OMG MUST DO IT RIGHT NOW thing. If you are a control freak (like me) you can't watch this. There is no way to program where it goes - you just have to watch it do one line through one room then make it's way to another room as you sit and stare at the spot of dirt that it just totally went right on by. You can block off it's exits - but the entire point of a robot vacuum is that I'm NOT doing the work - that includes furniture moving. Since this is not my main vacuum, I'm learning to let it go. Even on the highest setting, the suction is not great. I bought this because of all of the reviews saying how awesome the suction was and how it cleaned people's floors so well...no. Maybe that was the super expensive version? I didn't (don't) understand what the differences are with all of the very differently priced options available. What I am reviewing is (at the time) the cheapest option. The suction is horrid. I have watched it go over hardwood and not pick up little bits - it didn't even need to go through a carpet and it still missed them. but..... It DOES pick something up, the box fills and I empty it. It does stop and beep at me pretty regularly to clean the brush as it is full of dog fur, but that's fine - every vacuum has that issue in my house. We finally just started turning the power completely off because it will just randomly start. After 27 years, we finally had the tv moment in the house where I (wife) heard a noise and frantically woke the husband up to go check on it. *punch punch* ""Honey! The robot is vacuuming - it's ALIVE"" - this has happened 4 or 5 times so far at totally random times - nothing is programmed. So - that is weird lol! But fixable. TLDR: In all....It's not as good as I hoped, but it is about what I expected. It may work well in a no pet house. Don't expect beautiful vacuum lines, you won't get them.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"

I thought it would entertaining, even relaxing to watch it wander aimlessly around. However, it’s powerful motor means that when confronted with an obstacle it may simply try to run it over, getting stuck on simple things… until it runs out of power.

Also, it ripped apart my jute rug from getting stuck so many times.","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2024"
B07R295MLS,3,Ok you have a small home with no pets you might be ok....Eufy Customer service is top notch.,"First let me say I'm comparing this C20 vac robot's performance compared to my two other Shark vacuum/mop robots that I have owned for multiple years. This robot does do a good job of vacuuming the floor and it also does a good job of mopping the floor. The picture shows what this robot mopped up after my iRobot m6 went first. The noise level of the robot is what I consider average during cleaning in normal mode. I have not bothered to try turbo yet. That is about all I can say good about this robot. It takes over 9 hours and 5, yes 5 recharges to do my house. The Shark can do it on a single charge and in about 1 hours and 20 minutes. I do have a Border Collie, and she does shed, but it's winter time where she's not shedding much at this time, and it is still too much for the vacuum to empty itself properly with out clogging. The self-cleaning brush roll does a pretty good job, but still leaves clumps and the edges collect a lot of hair. The C20 seems to be in a hurry to get back to work and only allows itself a 30% to 40% charge before returning to cleaning. This allows it to clean one room, possibly two before having to return to charge again. While the brushes do lift when the C20 leaves the hard floor to transition onto a carpet, the mops still seems to rub along the edge and leave a different pattern. The carpet doesn't feel wet but definitely looks different. I'm a big fan of Eufy products for being good quality for the price, but I think this one was a swing and a miss, unless you live in a small house or apartment with no pets... Edit to add: Tested ""turbo"" mode on my living room. It took over 5 hours with several recharges to vacuum for just over 1 hour. The battery on this vac is way under sized. Edit to add: I have been contacted by Eufy Customer service, they have gone over the top to try and make things better for me. I'm still a big fan of the Eufy/Anker brand and will continue to be.

While cleaning up the eufy 11S for packing and return, I found a thin thread that had neatly balled up my GSD's fur under the brush. I SWAG that the bind caused the eufy to use more power as it worked, or would stop it dead until the battery failed. Once I cleaned up the brush, vacuumed out the bin, and left it to charge, the eufy 11s ran for its hour of vacuum time. So, operator error. The battery is good. Nov 19, 2024 The replacement eufy Robot Vacuum 11S Max issued by Amazon. This robot was delivered the 23rd of October. At first, it was fine. It would vacuum and park itself. It is much quieter than the Roomba in my bedroom. However, after a couple of weeks, it vacuumed and didn't park. Around the 10th of November, I began timing it. It would die in about 20 minutes. The time kept dropping and as of today, it did not make just 10 minutes. My friend has two eufys and they have been wonderful for a couple of years. I am guessing eufy got a bad batch of batteries. I haven't given up . . . yet. I will order another. YMMV Oct 22, 2024. The eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX. I noticed on the 3rd day that the robot had not parked itself. I put it on the stand. Same thing the 4th day. Today, the 7th day, it ran for one minute. 4 beeps and flashing red says it needs a charge. I charge it 12 to 24 hours per day. To all appearances, the battery is failing to charge. Pity, since it did a good job and is way quieter than my Roomba 690. I am returning it for replacement. Pros - the eufy doesn't require you to hook it up to the internet, nor does it require your location. It is very quiet - in fact, when it gets stuck, you need a quiet house to find it. The remote is easy to use and programming is a snap. The clean up is very good. I have cats and dogs and it picks up their hair and litter Cons - The afore-mentioned battery. Ran for two hours the first day. I was looking forward to it staying with me. Day 3 to Day 7, it died in minutes. Charge 12 - 24 hours every day.

B07R295MLS,3,Perfect for a perfectly square room and that’s about it,"My house is very simple. Lots of straight lines and not a lot of furniture, I’m quite a minimalist. Which is why I thought any robot vacuum would work. But I was wrong. Pros: vacuums around round things very well, and the suction works nicely - it really does pick up stuff well and gets all the dust from my bird off my LVP Cons: it doesn’t map, which I don’t really understand how you can have a robot vacuum that doesn’t map because it will NEVER understand where it has been and where it hasn’t. This vacuum, after running on auto for about 20 minutes, vacuumed the same two spots in my house repeatedly, missing a lot of spots. When it hits a wall, it either determines that the wall will keep going (and just vacuums along the wall, going a completely different direction when the wall ends) or it turns around 180 degrees and goes the other direction but diagonally so it literally misses everything and just follows the same path it was just on. It hates rugs, so despite the advertising saying it could go from hard wood to a low pile rug, that was incorrect. It got caught up on two of my rugs and the brush fell off. For some reason, it got stuck in my foyer just going back and forth repeatedly about 10 times before it finally left that room, only to return back to it after a spin in my kitchen (where it missed 90% of the floor?) and ended up getting stuck in that same spot in my foyer. Why did it go back to my foyer when it already vacuumed there? No mapping, that’s why. I don’t really understand owning a robot vacuum that you have to keep an eye on. The reason you own one is so you can move on with your other chores or life responsibilities. You might as well just pick up your own vacuum and do your own floor if you’re just gonna have to follow this robot around everywhere.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

B07R295MLS,3,Too many limitations,"I can’t really evaluate this product because I never used it, but I did read the manual and saw it wouldn’t work in my house. Before letting the sweeper do its thing you have to tuck in the fringes of your rugs, and remove the wires from the floor. Then I looked at the spaces between chairs and chair legs that would prevent the sweeper from moving under or between them, and concluded I would still have to drag out my Kenmore canister to finish the cleaning. In addition, it’s pretty heavy and I have two levels to clean. (I have a lightweight cleaner downstairs, so I would still have manual work to do.) All in all, I can see how this cleaner might be great for some houses, but not mine.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

B07R295MLS,3,Eufy needs to improve the sensors and a few more things,"Play Video This is my third Eufy robot vacuum and my fourth robot vacuum overall. I previously loved my first Eufy 30C from 2019, then upgraded to the Eufy G10 Hybrid in 2022. In 2024, I tried the Dreame L10s Pro Gen 2, which became my favorite despite lacking auto-emptying and mop washing/drying features. So, I decided to try the Eufy Omni C20 All-in-One Station. The Eufy Omni C20 was easy to set up. The box included a quick start guide and safety information but no detailed instruction manual. I found the user manual in the app after adding the device to my phone. The robot mapped my home in about 20 minutes and did a decent job. However, the first cleaning was not impressive compared to my Dreame L10s. The Eufy got stuck on a floor carpet, ran over my shoes (I know it says to pick up objects, but my Dreame never ran over my shoes), and then got stuck under a side table (see picture). My Dreame vac had no issues navigating around this same side table. The Eufy Omni C20’s auto-empty feature, mop head cleaning, and drying were impressive (though quite noisy—see video). Unfortunately, I was not impressed with its object sensing. The vacuum seemed clumsy, often bumping into furniture and getting stuck. While the auto-empty and mop cleaning station is a nice upgrade, the navigation and obstacle sensing need improvement. Overall, a decent robot vacuum, but it fell short of my expectations based on previous experiences with Eufy and my current Dreame L10s.","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2024"

It loves being thorough under my couch, under other pieces of furniture, and other places you can’t see. My floors are cleaner and I didn’t have to do it myself, which is nice, but if I knew it was gonna meander about loudly and miss a thousand spots in the most open parts of the floor and spend most of its time under my couch, I would have picked another brand.","Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2024"

B07R295MLS,3,It’s not smart… but it vacuums,"We got this on sale for $150… and it’s definitely not the best but may have been up there when robot vacuums first came out I am currently writing this while the vacuum attempts to go back to home base for charging by moving in the opposite direction of home base. Not sure how it thinks home base is outside of the house, but it’s trying its best. It does make it to home base like maybe 60-75% of the time unless it gets stuck. The suction is pretty decent and it’s certainly durable. It’s gotten stuck a few times and audibly fights for its survival before beeping for help. It sometimes detects furniture and avoids hitting it, other times it rams into planters and breaks them. It vacuums a lot up when it is vacuuming. Because it does not have mapping abilities, parts of the room sometimes don’t get vacuumed before the battery dies. Which brings me to the next point - the battery life is definitely getting shorter. I have had it for a month now and for $150 , it is what I expect or maybe overpriced by like $50 for what I expect.","Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2024"
B07R295MLS,3,Not the smartest Robot,"With 3 cats I wanted a vacuum that I could run while working from home. It's okay but you better make sure everything it can push or pull is out of it's way. It actually pulled a lamp wire and shorted it out. I got it on sale so I got what I paid for. It has a remote control but I didn't really want to babysit this thing and even when I'm using it I feel like it's working against me. While I observed it, it tends to go in circles and keeps in the area it's in never expanding outward and in no uniform direction that I can tell. I gave it 3 stars because it's okay and can go under low furniture and the suction is good. UPDATE: The company did reach out to me and replace the unit with a different one. The new unit has an app for your phone and came with metal strips you can tape to the floor to stop it from getting at things. They're iffy because I won't tape them down. Anyway this new unit seems to run a little better then the other unit but I don't really understand it's path - it's suppose to go full lane up and down but let's face it you wouldn't have any furniture if that was the case so I just let it do it's thing because it does change direction once it bumps into something. It would be nice if you are able to combine the remote feature (backward/forward etc) to the app as the unit has gotten stuck and no choice but to go pick it up. The app has a layout which I'm confused about. Not sure it's accurate but says only for reference so I guess that's where it roomed. Bottom line - It does do as intended which is to get the pet hair up in between my full vacuum and I like the low profile to move under furniture.","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024"

And it cant handle corners — the little side brush can’t get into corners at all because threads are not long enough, leaves maybe 6-inch gaps full of dust there. And can’t find home base if it is anywhere near a corner, just gets totally lost there.

Easier to just knock off the short pet hair into the can and keep the paper filter from clogging. We run 2 in the main floor, 1 in each bedroom. Emptying every other day if no children are around. A little noisy but not louder than a normal vacuum. They all roni vacs will find places to hang up on and just make the fixes save yourself the trouble later. The side brush 1, hangs up on different longer tassels if your rugs or dog toys have them a robot vac does not bode well without parting with one or the other. Will always have robot vacs in my home as it avoids agitation of back injury. If you have a pet that leaves “gifts” for you to clean up after a robot is not for you.

Previous review: I bought this vacuum cleaner with the highest of expectations because my daughter had one that worked well. She purchased hers sometime prior. This one I bought was the same brand and model, but it has been a terrible disappointment. It goes right over top of dust clumps, and leaves them and other debris on the floor in its tracks. It does not have an effective intuitive path to cover the entire room, either. I have put it on the optional maximum setting, but to no avail.

Gets stuck everywhere, even on the edge of steps where no vacuum ever got stuck. Also, the robot and the charger have very bright light so can’t use it in the bedroom. On the plus side it is low profile so fits under furniture and also unafraid of black carpet that stops more intelligent robots. We will keep it for the latter purpose.

B07R295MLS,3,OK for some purposes,"So I waited to post until I really had some time to use this machine. To give you a sense of my situation, I wanted something inexpensive that would help me with cat hair and just clean the lower level/basement space. And, Wirecutter from the NYT recommended this one so I thought that was good enough for me. I paid $150 so that's pretty great, right? Yes, if it works well enough to match the price. Overall, I'd say yes. Also, I have the LTV flooring and the lower level space is wide open. It's a perfect space and it should be easy enough for an inexpensive machine. I'm not sure how it would work in other spaces but I'd think in a similar way. OK, let's get to it. At the start I found the product really annoying. It vacuums like it is drunk. It hits something and bounces off into another direction. There is seemingly no clear plan overall for the machine. As others have noted, it does not record a floor map. Which is ok, but the drunken bit is an impediment because I cannot tell if it quite got the whole room or area. It is quiet. You do have to empty the machine and filter. That is fine with me. I want to see what it picks up. It is not run by an app but by a remote like you would use for a tv. That's not a dealbreaker for me. You can schedule it to clean each day. I’ve had this machine for a few months now and I use it everyday. Not kidding. Everyday to clean the same area and it does what I need it to do. but it does. Overall, it does what I want to do. Drunkenly, but it does. As a result, we named it Kronos because Kronos ate a rock thinking it was Zeus. Kronos is not smart. So, there you go. But it works well enough for my needs. Which means the price is fair. PS: I’ve see other reviewers compare it to an iRobot. I have an iRobot on the main level so imho you get what you pay.","Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024"

B07R295MLS,3,"Better at vacuuming than I imagined, too dumb to use in my house.","While I was initially impressed by how well it cleans, I ended up returning this and bought a lidar guided one from a different brand. My biggest problems were that this unit made no effort to avoid furniture and would bash into my furniture legs much harder than I was comfortable with. Lighter weight objects, like end tables or decorations, would be moved around or knocked over. Additionally, it would wedge itself under my couch and need to be rescued every single time I used it. While I only tried the feature once, it could not find it's way back to the dock to charge. As far as I could tell, it would just wander aimlessly, bashing from wall to wall, hoping to eventually stumble upon the dock. It didn't even know what direction to go. I do have some positives. The unit did clean better than I expected. It could easily traverse from hard floors to carpet, and would adjust the suction power automatically. It could navigate over flooring transitions easily, and seemed good about getting itself unstuck, except when it went under my couch. It was also very easy to set up and empty the dust container. Overall, this might be fine for a first apartment or dorm filled with cheap furniture (or better yet, no furniture), but it didn't work for me.","Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024"

We bought a newer model and I have mixed feelings about it. The good: it's lower to the ground and can successfully go under the sofa without getting stuck - in fact, it seems to get stuck less overall, which is nice. What's not nice: the old model had three brushes - this one has only 1 - and did a better job cleaning. The old one also came with replacement filter and brushes, which this one did not. The new one has a smaller dust container, which means more emptying. Overall, I'm glad to have this to pick up some of the dust and dog hair, but wish it did as good a cleaning job as the old one.","Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2024"

It's not the end of the world, but the performance isn't great on this vacuum. I have 2 dogs and a cat and I purchased this to help cut down on how often I needed to use my bigger vacuum. This vacuum rarely finishes a job - either due to getting stuck somewhere or running out of battery. I always have to hunt for it to figure out where it died. It doesn't appear to clean in a reliable pattern so there are areas missed frequently. Overall I wouldn't purchase this again.","Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2024"

B07R295MLS,3,Not enough suction but good for pet hair,"While I liked the remote control operation of the vac and it did very well picking up pet hair on smooth floors, it was not able to pick up cat sand from the floor. The price was very reasonable. So I was not surprised. It has a nice low profile so it slides under the couches and coffee tables. The manual mode was like driving a remote control toy car to a particular area to clean. When left on the auto mode it covered the floors in a random pattern which was decently clean except as mentioned, the cat box litter sand. I returned it for the same brand with more power. That model is doing well.","Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2024"

It also gets stopped by cords and wires more easily; it is extremely quiet, tho. I wound up giving it to a cousin and she’s overjoyed, while I inherited an iRobot from another family member.

B07R295MLS,3,No Mapping Feature = Hit & Miss Vacuuming,"The Pros: Well written directions, easy set-up, price ($150). Cons: small dust cup compared to my Shark Navigator, when the description states that there is no mapping feature it translates operationally to the vacuum doing under the table 4 times and missing vast parts of the hall (as an example), it wanders aimlessly. Recommended as a budget pick by Wired. Our house is 1800 sf open concept. I closed the doors to the 3 bedrooms & bathroom so that the vacuum would sweep only the kitchen, living, dining and main hall area which is where dirt is tracked and dog/cat spend time. It swept well in the areas where it went but missed complete swaths of the area I had hoped it would clean. Never intended this vacuum to replace my upright, rather wanted it to keep a lid on debris dragged in by the dog. This vacuum may work for a smaller area or apartment dweller. For my house I should have saved my money and purchased a $600 robot vacuum with mapping so that the whole tiled area would be vacuumed.","Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2024"
B07R295MLS,3,Rolling brush noise,"UPDATE: Just wanted to give Eufy customer service 5 star. They responded to the review I posted instantly and reached out to me to help resolve the issue. It is a great product. Noise level is outstanding comparing to other products that I’ve owned. Suction is great. I have four dogs that shed quite a bit and this vacuum kept my floor decently clean (vacuuming twice a day). However, after exactly a month using it, it starts making weird noises, even after the equipment is cleaned throughout to remove any debris. Troubleshooting using the support webpage found that the rolling brush is causing the issue. It appears that the ends had worn out. This equipment is only a month old and its part already worn out? Unfortunately, it is now past the return time frame from Amazon. It would be nice if the equipment comes with a replacement rolling brush if it could be damage that soon.","Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2024"
B07R295MLS,3,You get what you pay for - UPDATE,"Update: One of the Eufy reps contacted me a few days after my original review. I explained the situation. The rep was kind, listened to everything I did to correct the issue before attempting to contact them. The rep acknowledged there was an issue with the model I purchased and offered to exchange or refund me the full amount. I opted for the refund. The process time was a lot faster than expected. Customer Service: 5 stars. While working on this refund, I eyed the newer version of the Eufy 11s Max on sale, so I decided to give the company one more try. I took a chance and bought the machine. I’ve been using it for less than a month and noticed this newer version doesn’t have as good suction power as my older model. Also, this design only has one rotator instead of two. This means that any debris that this rotator picks up may not always land in the suction zone. Therefore, some of the dirt and hair just gets pushed around. For that reason, I’ve recommenced the return process. I feel the design change and reduced suction knocks my rating back down to 3 stars. Overall, this vacuum is great for a person on a budget. The product works great for a while but you may have to interact with customer service several times. Stay on top of cleaning it, run a brush around the wheels and fan to make sure debris doesn’t clog your device, empty the container as often as possible in order to prolong its lifespan. Original Post (initially gave 2 stars): I purchased this item in July 2022 for $150, a hundred below asking price. At first it worked great. I would clean the vacuum every day and washed the filter every few days. I bought a few filter replacements and additional brushed, and would changed it every 4 months or so. Just over a year of owning, the vacuum started giving me issues. First was the three beeps. I went insane trying to fix the issue. I ended up un assembling the vac and brushing off the dust and debris accumulated over the past year. It worked like a charm and thought that was the end and may have to do that again in another 12 months. In December, I noticed the vacuum would die in random parts of my house. It wouldn’t make it back to its docking area. I bought it a new battery and once again, I thought “another 12 months”. Wrong! Two months later (yesterday), I got the blasted 3 beeps again! I un assembled it, cleaned it out and thought it would work… it did not. I opened it 3 more times to assume that I has connected the parts correctly. Still wont work. It lasted 1 year and 7 months. I guess you get what you pay for.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,So so,"This vacuum works excellently. I think it was a great purchase. The reason that I’m giving it 2 stars is because this vacuum was advertised as new.

B07R295MLS,2,I don't understand the high ratings,"I was excited to try this thing out based on the very high number of excellent ratings, but after using it I have no idea why so many people seem to like this thing so much, unless they're not real reviews. Here's my take, though please note I've never owned a robot vacuum so I have no basis for comparison: Pros: -slim, fits under my kitchen counters to get at the hard to reach parts -quiet, I didn't find it to disruptive That's it. That's all I really liked. Cons: -Listing says it has ""Anti-collision sensors ensure RoboVac doesn’t bump into objects around the house."" I'd say it hit walls and/or objects about 70-80% of the time; sometimes it almost seemed to intentionally bang into stuff, and actually did scuff some of my furniture. -No mapping/learning. This is probably on me, but I expected it to learn the layout of my home at least a bit, but come to find out it has zero learning/mapping capabilities. -Completely random cleaning patterns. There is no rhyme or reason to it's cleaning pattern; it just wanders about like a drunken tourist lost in a new city. It repeatedly cleans the same areas over and over and over and over, and yet avoided other, open areas completely. This also meant I had to always know where it was, or run the risk of turning around and finding it right underfoot even though it had been in the entry way around the corner and down the hall only moments before. Folks have said that it eventually gets everything, but I found the random travel and repetition to be maddening and wildly inefficient. -Remote has to be pointed directly at it or it doesn't work at all. While it's more fun to manually drive this thing around than it is to push a vacuum, it's more frustrating and takes 10x as long. And instead of making logical adjustments when manually controlling it, the thing often tries to wildly over-correct or turn completely around instead of just a little bit, so I end up mashing away at the buttons trying to get it to totally cover a 3x5 area. -Auto return to home.... not so much. It repeatedly tried to go the completely wrong direction from the base, or took the absolutely most obstructed path possible, so I had to manually steer it to about 3 feet from the dock before it would finally figure it out. Bottom line: I bought this so I wouldn't have to think about cleaning my floors so much. Instead, I have to babysit the thing and manually direct it to clean some areas, with all the steering control of an old, unmaintained bumper car. Sort of defeats the purpose, and not worth the money I spent, even on sale.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"

It gets stuck on literally ANY upright object. No matter whether it's a couch, my kitchen chair, my dog, etc, for way too long, before finally figuring out how to get past the object. Only for it to continue cleaning an area it had already traversed multiple times. Lidar, in my opinion, should be the first feature any robovac/mop has, especially at this price point.

B07R295MLS,2,11S isn't what it used to be,"I had an older version of the 11S that worked for YEARS. Always kept the floors so clean, and I have tile, wool rugs (wool sheds a lot), girls with long hair, and wood floors (approx 2000 sq ft). It was an amazing unit. I also bought an L70 unit just for mopping, maybe 2 years ago. When my husband decided to service the older 11S unit, he did something and it is now dead. So, I bought this new version. The new version only has 1 brush at the front, and in my experience, means it picks up far less. The L70 has only one rotating brush, and could never keep up with the older 11S in terms of dirt pickup. It is crazy loud, and this is coming from someone who has had a iRobot, and 2 prior eufy's. Additionally, after initiating its maiden run, it almost immediately got stuck on a dining room chair's legs and couldn't get unstuck. There is no map with this unit, whereas the L70 has a map, and I do think there is value for a map, but not at the expense of inferior pickup, which is why I opted to replace the older 11S. Needless to say, I already sent it back. Quality was just not there any more, which is a shame because the 11S was such a good vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2024"

B07R295MLS,2,"No guts, no glory",Tried to use this to vacuum my home. The dust canister was very tiny and had to be emptied constantly. The unit didn't seem to have much suction power.

I gave up and donated it to someone who needed light cleaning.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,"Easy setup, Fascinating. ###Then stopped working!###","### UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW#### I posted the review below after using the vac successfully for a week. Since then the vac has stopped working. Texting with Eufy customer support was pure insanity and was not helpful. A request to escalate the issue has been met with crickets. After several weeks of frustrating canned emails from the seller, they did finally offer to replace the unit#### I have resisted the idea of an automated vacuum cleaner for a long time, thinking that they were just expensive toys. However the opportunity to test this was offered to me as an Amazon Vine reviewer and I have had the chance to see how this works. It's fascinating. This model has a fairly competent vacuum and the ability to mop the appropriate floors with water. It basically can be taught to know where to mop and where to vacuum and it does so with ease. As with any autonomous device, you need to make sure that the areas you want cleaned are not confusing to the algo--meaning, don't leave too much stuff around for it to have to figure out and make sure there is nothing which will trap it. It wasn't much of an issue in practice and any hiccups are easily remedied. The worst thing that has happened so far has been the robot finding its way under a hutch, catching on to a lamp wire and pulling the lamp off of the shelf. The solution was to mark the hutch as 'no go' and that solved the problem. There is no remote control--just an app. I found set up to be pretty straightforward--you are asked to charge the unit thoroughly before proceeding. So when you receive this, you might want to go ahead and charge it right away. Once charged and activated, the device will go on a walkabout through your home, mapping your rooms, walls and obstacles with something called 'laser pointer' which is not explained but produces a fairly detailed rendering of your home. You can have this map up to three floors (or separate maps if you prefer) so that it can be used in other spaces, You can manually adjust the maps once drawn to suit your own definition of which room is which. The mopping part was really interesting as well. Two spinning discs serve as the mop. The weight of the machine serves to allow the machine to apply cleaning pressure The device is able to mop, store the dirty water, discharge it into its home base and take on clean water by itself. It also air dries and cleans its own mop. When in use, you can see the robot on the map as it works. You can override what it is doing if you like but the seller recommends you allow it to run autonomously for best results. For me, this is an ideal compromise since you can have this clean the floors every day. It is thorough enough to mostly eliminate typical spills and spots that a tile floor will accumulate during the day saving you to do a more through hand mopping only when the floor really needs it. Vacuuming is also pretty competent, covering most areas and retrieving a fair amount of stuff that you might not even notice. It won't eliminate entirely the need for a hand vacuuming from time to time but it is surprisingly good at what it is supposed to do. The Eufy is round and room corners are usually square so that is one inherent issue since the machine cannot really get into the entire corner due to its shape but I judge it not to be too important. The build quality is very good--this is a rugged device that should last if taken care of. There are a fair amount of 'consumables' that need to be replaced from time to time (brushes, rollers, filters and dirt bags) which the app tracks the usage of. Replacements are available on Amazon from the seller and also thrid parties. You can also choose to buy a detergent or cleaning solution to add to the reservoir if you like which will increase the cleaning ability of the device. I haven't tried it and frankly, the performance with water alone seems fine. It is a bit noisy when it is running. I imagined that I would let it run after we have all gone to sleep and clean up the kitchen floor but the noise level is audible and I will see if I am better off letting it run in the morning after we have all left the house. Overall, I am impressed with this--much more than I expected to be. It has a very good idea of where it is at all times and doesn't seem to miss a spot. While it could clean an entire floor of a home in a single go, in practice it is much better suited to handling a room or two at a time. Obviously this cannot 'see' dirt or spots, but it covers the floor pretty perfectly. Because it vacuums and mps every single square inch, it captures dirt that a human might not see or bother with. If it runs out of battery, it goes back and charges itself and then resumes where it left off. I wouldn't call it 'clever' but it is a well thought out device.","Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2024"

B07R295MLS,2,Randomly drove around the house,"This was my first attempt at a robot vacuum. I bought it mostly because of the price. It was on sale and figured that it might be worth it. There's no real way to program it, other than a few remote buttons. It drove around randomly and as soon as it touched something it went in opposite direction then back again. No lines and it missed a considerable amount of carpet. It missed half of my living room then went to bedroom to do the same. I don't have time to watch it and use the remote to drive it like a toy car... defeated the purpose of a robot. I ended up returning it and will get an app smart based one instead. This one didn't really have any kind of smarts.","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,Get a smarter model,"The vacuum gets stuck so much that it doesn't significantly simplify my chores. Since it doesn't 'remeber' problem places like under the table, I have to unstick it about 40% of the time. Before it runs, I have to clean up, move the gaming chair, close the closet, and tuck up the curtains. As I'm writing, the vacuum is one minute 30 of bumping around under the same chair, capable of getting in but not out. I recommend spending a little more on a smarter model.","Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,Gets caught on everything,"This is my third robot vacuum, both of the other two were different brands. I fully understand robot vacuums don’t do well around obstacles such as rugs or furniture however, in the past the first one or two runs, it is easy to establish trouble areas within the household, figure out which rugs need to be picked up, etc. I have had this vacuum now for two weeks and I might as well vacuum the house manually for as much time as I spend saving this thing. I do not know that it is any shorter than my other models, but due to the suspension, it will squat and go under recliners, brace pieces On chairs and tables Only to get stuck because the brush is then pushed so far into the carpet it gets matted up. More on the small (horizontal brush) It is much longer than other models I have seen, and I think this attributes to the amount of tangling it does. Sometimes it stops the vacuum other times the brush gets tangled, and the vacuum moves on without it since it only pops on. This brush also gets caught on Every rug in the house As well as small transitions in the floor from one room to another (Other models I have seen tend to struggle with flimsy rugs or ones that don’t lay correctly, this one struggles even transitioning from hard floor to medium ply carpet. As I am writing this, it is currently trying to climb up the recliner for the third time while it cannot seem to make a successful transition when carpet is A quarter inch taller from one room to the next, it will give all of its battery life to attempt climbing over The inch and a half horizontal leg that sticks out from behind the recliner 2 inches. *** My Takeaway is that if I had not purchased this on sale, I would definitely send it back, but I did get a very good deal on it and I still have a couple more weeks to decide (I may keep it just to use for the dining room and robot proof one room of my house) This design could be improved greatly if it had two shorter horizontal brushes instead of one long one And if The programming Was more sensitive to being stuck it would do less damage to its brush and my carpet and be easier to rescue.","Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,Stopped working after 45 days,I had an iRobot vacuum for 10 years that I loved. Sadly it was time to replace it and decided to try the Eufy brand. Big mistake. It started malfunctioning after the first month using it. I reached out to Eufy via e-mail to see if I could get a replacement. After 2 weeks of on and off troubleshooting (they kept sending me e-mails asking me to try different things to try and get it to work) I finally called them directly and asked what my options were at this point because I needed a working vacuum. They asked me to ship my vacuum back to them at which point they would send me a replacement. I'm giving this 2 starts because I clearly received a lemon considering the problems I had within the first 2 months.

The vac is constantly caught up on cord covers that shouldn't be anything for the device based off of the specifications provided by the manufacturer. It easily gets stuck in circles, literally, on table bases, and leaves something to be desired when it comes to providing consistently clean floors.

B07R295MLS,2,Not impressed,"1) It gets stuck, a lot, between chair legs, under furniture (seems to be able to get under sofas, but then cannot get out), behind chairs (and cannot seem to find its way out). 1a) One reason it gets stuck (after observing it many times)... eventually it starts to run low on power. But before it has decided that it is so low on power that it should return to the base, it is still trying to clean. But at this point it does not have enough power to move from a hardwood floor to a carpet, or over any bump, etc. So it just weakly tries, over and over again, to get over a carpet edge, until it dies. 2) It is too random. It misses a lot of dirt right next to where it just cleaned. 3) Its suction is not the greatest. 4) Hair tangles way too easily in the brush. In fact, hardly any long hair makes its way into the dust bin, as it never gets past the brush roller. 5) When cleaning multiple rooms, it often starts to lose energy far from its base, and then cannot seem to find its way back to the base before it totally runs out of power -- just randomly stopping anywhere. 6) The dust collection bin is a mess to empty. And considering how little it holds, it must be emptied often. 7) Between spending time trying to find the robot (when it is not on the base as expected), cleaning up after emptying the dust bin, and detangling hair from the roller, my time would be better spent using a regular vacuum cleaner.","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2024"

It doesn’t ever decide it’s done because it has no idea where it’s been so it will run until the battery dies and still miss 1/3 of the room. On the other hand, it does have suction and seems like it would be durable, so I gave it 2 stars for that.

As you can see from the video the brush no longer spins rendering the vacuum close to useless. I have attempted to clean / replace the brush without any success. Stay away!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,Not very good,"Needs constant attention, keeps missing spots because it does not cover the entire room unless you are constantly directing it with the remote -- which kind of makes the ""auto"" setting useless.","Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,Does not clean the whole floor,The vacuum worked well in picking up dirt and dog fur. However it had no rhyme or reason as to where it cleaned. It also had a lot of dog fur wrapped around the roller after about 20 minutes run time. Not worth it- it was returned.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,I liked it at first,I ordered this for a gift to my mom. Its very easy to use and set up. The quality of the vacuum itself is great. It navigates through door to door very well. The only problem is the battery life. It fit in well with the house. I just wish we couldve used it longer. The battery life lasted about 4 or 5 months and then it wouldnt charge correctly so we stopped using it due to it dying.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,Stops working after 6 months,"I loved this vaccum at first - it was relatively quiet and did a good job. I made sure to empty out the debri and clean the brushes regularly. It now runs really loud and will just turn off after about 10 minutes of use. It is not hot or dead, it just turns off and i have to bring it back to the charging station to get it to turn back on & repeat the process. Kind of defeats the purpose and a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,It is okay. Needs supervision.,"Initially when we got it for our house, I was jazzed. I used to set it to start up daily at the same time. But the issue is you have to watch the vacuum in case it eats your wires or it gets stuck. It's not the smartest. And it has broken one of our floor mirrors. I like the ability to schedule vacuuming but I wish I could schedule it weekly or every other day instead of daily. When I turn it on, I have to watch it or clean with it. It's kinda nice but it's not why I wanted a robot vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,1 Side Brush not as Good as Two,"I have had several Eufy before. This is the first one that only had 1 side brush. Ignore the company when they say 1 brush does as good as 2. It most definitely does NOT! I am disappointed in this vacuum big time. It does not do the job, just goes right over things and only the side with a brush picks up off the floor. Make sure if you buy a Eufy to get a model with 2 side brushes. The 1 brush version is useless.","Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024"
B07R295MLS,2,"Pretty terrible: if you have to babysit it, might as well just vacuum yourself","We bought this knowing it was a cheaper version but to test out if the cats freaked out or not before investing in a fancy one. This thing just gets stuck in a corner or under a table and repeats same area then gets stuck again. Pretty sad. Had it on for about 10 mins and it covered very little area. When it hits a leg of a table, it seems to spin just enough to hit the other leg of the table, then spins 180 and hits the first leg again. So it was stuck under the table this way a while. Then it got stuck in the corner, spun around just far enough to hit the other wall of the corner. Kind of funny actually. The little duster spinning thing is probably great for animal fur (why we bought it) but it sucked up nothing from our very short pile rug. Cat hissed once then was just following it. I was hoping one day they would ride it but I dont think I’ll even try it again. Pretty worthless. Seems stable. Zero mapping. Couldnt get it to come back to its charger/docking so had to pick it up and put it in front of it. Zero intelligence. Funny to watch it get stuck for some reason bc you expect it to be smarter I guess?","Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024"

B07R295MLS,2,"Loved Original 11S Slim, Not This One","My Eufy 11S Slim died after about 6 years. That worked really well for me as I loved the low profile and it's ability to get under almost all of my furniture (I didn't need all the mapping bells and whistles). So I figured I'd repeat with a slight upgrade to 11s MAX. Unfortunately Ive now been through 2 of them and the Boost IQ feature simply doesn't work. An hour spent with Eufy customer service resetting, etc. provided no solution. I'm also not quite convinced of the ""upgrade"" in removing one side brush, but can't say I properly tested that out given the broken boost. It's a bummer but I'll have toook elsewhere for my next robot vac.","Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2024"

B07R295MLS,1,Junk.,"Okay, so I thought I did good research on this. I saved up for this purchase excited since we had just finished installing new floors through our entire house. As soon as the installers left, I broke out my new vacuum, downloaded the app, followed the instructions and did the required upgrade to the vacuum. Once it started to do it's first mapping route, the app immediately said network slow. The vacuum would pull out from the base about a foot and just spin, then return to the base and start drying the completelt unused mop heads. I've tried taking it to my friends house and using another person's wifi, deleting the app and reseting the vacuum multiple times, tried repositioning a few feet from our router, tried running it through my ipad instead, everything including having comcast come out and check our network. Mind you, our TVs, alexa, ans any other devices in our house work just fine on our network. Eufy App would always say network slow and not even go further than a foot from the base. Obviously something is wrong with the vacuum, not my wifi. Finally contacted customer support. First one in the chats brilliant solution was to try ro run the vacuum through Hotspot. Seemed ridiculous, but I tried. Once again, app said network slow. He then said he can't help me and that my chat log is being sent to their ""engineering department"". Waited 1-2 days for their ""engineering department"" to email me. They wanted proof of purchase, serial number, and a video of what's wrong with it. Submitted it and was told it'd be another 1-2 days while their ""engineers"" review my issue. Woke up to an email this morning from their engineers and their suggestion after everything I've told them was to ""try restarting it"". Did they even read my messages of everything I've tried to do to be able to just use and keep my vacuum? Try hot spot and restarting it is their advice from their ""engineering department"" after days of waiting for a solution? Returning this. Customer service is a joke if they ship you a faulty vacuum.

It how’s around for a hour and a half making more noise than two toddlers. I don’t know if it’s just me but the sound of this thing is like a screeching that makes my ears bleed. Using a real vacuum does not make me feel this way at all as far as the sound. I dont know why this tiny little thing is so loud. The beeping is also extremely loud, every time it gets stuck on something it starts beeping your ears out. I tried returning it and getting a different one cause maybe it was defective but nope it’s all the same. It’s also not very smart as it will go around in the same room of the house for 45 minutes.

I contacted Eufy spending 40 minutes on a online chat with a promise of communication via email for a refund. Crickets. I was told it is not a mapping vacuum and is meant to zig-zag.

I opened the shipping box before giving it to her and instantly noticed the tape on the outside of the eufy box was taped with clear packing tape. A portion of the box had been cut away as well (for warranty purposes?). When I took the robovac out, it wasn't in any kind of protective sleeve like you'd expect. Most disgusting though was the dust/sand particles in the tray and lint and fuzz on the rollers. It was obviously used.

For that price, it's easily 6-stars. Set up was extremely easy and quick. I habitually sweep and spot-vacuum the apartment whenever I feel a crumb underfoot — the first time I ran this vacuum, it sucked up a fluffy ""brick"" of lint and debris that I somehow missed in the various crevices or underneath furniture. I couldn't believe it. Registration for the app was easy (feel free to use a secondary email address for privacy). The app itself is pretty smooth, intuitive and feature-packed. The only thing I wish it did was save a record of the map that was created during a vacuum session. As far as I can see, it deletes itself each time the device ends its cleaning period. Now, at full price (~$250), I don't know if I would rate it at the imaginary 6-stars I mentioned above — perhaps 4 or 4.5 stars. It feels like a lot of money for lesser-known brand, and for barebones unit that doesn't mop or self-empty. I wouldn't go lower than 4-stars though, because it seems to clean very well, comes with replacement parts (filter and sweeps), and has a nice app. The battery life suggests 120 minutes but it seems to be more like 90, and that is on ""Standard"" settings. Via the app, it has scheduling, manual remote control, quiet mode, standard mode, high performance mode, full area (formulaic), full area (random), spot cleaning, etc. Updates can also be pushed through the app. It's a great all-around device.

B0D9W3B622,5,W O W ! Review from a Skeptic First timer. **1 year later UPDATE,"OK, so as many of you, I was looking for a Low Cost ""IRobot"" alternative for home cleaning. I have been struggling with Pet Hair, dirt and overall cleanliness since the whole pandemic stay at home issue and now, working from home and having a 12 yr old in the house and a dog, you an imagine the mess. So I looked around and with all those options available for robotic vacuums I was really struggling to decide on what to buy. In one hand you have established brands like I robot, Shark, etc, with their offerings, but as you know, just the name alone is something that will drive the price up and in the other hand, you have a lot of ""generic"" or not so recognized brands offering the same type of product. So after a long review evaluating here in amazon and on You Tube, I decided on this one. The price and features were in sync with what I was looking for, I was not looking for a super smart, wifi, tecno robot (price would be in the $250 - $350 easily) just one with the basics and remote control. Well let me tell you something, this thing, totally surpassed my expectations. This thing is AMAZING. It is so simple to handle, very sturdy, the remote functions couldn't be more easy to understand and use and the cleaning....MAN< THE CLEANING. This thing took my living room and in less than 30 minutes, left it close to spotless. I just did a test run, to understand the features and so on, but after seeing what it could do, it totally blew me away. The SOUND is something that I thought would be annoying after looking at a couple of videos, but the videos do not seem to reflect really the noise levels. I had the thing running in the living room while watching a movie in the TV. Not a problem. SOund levels are way below what I expected. I can say it is in par if not below what a tower fan would be. When the unit was cleaning below the sofa I WAS SITTING ON, I thought it had stopped working. It was that silent. The cleaning of the unit and disposing of the trash bin is great too. Very accessible, and sturdy, I don't see the dust bin breaking or failing anytime soon. The cleaning patterns are great, it seems random, but I reckon it has a couple of patterns to use once its on AUTO. It first gets the middle of the room, then it moves to the corners and I have to say, I have chairs, sofas, barstools and this thing got into all of it eventually. I have ran the automatic program cleaning 5 times and It has cleaned everywhere it fits in great detail. Of course you have to get those hard to reach places but overall, if you walk through it, it will get cleaned. With this said, and looking at the great way the unit is constructed, I believe it will be the sensors and electronics that will eventually have to pass the test of time. The unit has a lot of sensors, electronics to help it navigate obstacles, walls etc, and those things are sensitive. But if the unit is as greatly made in the outside and with all the mechanical parts as sturdy as they seem, I expect the electronics to be the same quality too. Overall for a first time buyer / user of such units, I am soo amazingly happy with the product. I have seen other robots from more established brands at my neighbors houses, and they are LOUDER and to be honest, for what they told me they cost, it seemed way overpriced. Im already thinking of buying one for my parents so they can use it and they are over 80 and I am 100% sure they will be able to use it with the remote. This is very simple to use 1 yearUPDATE*** So one year later, the unit is going strong and just the same as it did right out the box. I use it about 2 times a week on AUTO. I clean the bin, brushes and filter every time before use and I have only changed the front brushes and filter to a new one, only once . I havent noticed any issues with runtime and battery life at all. It still cleans great throughout and works just fine. It always returns to its docking station, no matter where it is when battery runs low. Overall an amazing buy. I did purchased one for my parents and that one also still running great. AAA+++ Great Product","Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,5,Enjoy your clean home!,"I recently purchased the Robot vaccum and mop combo, and it has truly transformed my home cleaning experience. This robotic vacuum and mop is an absolute game-changer, deserving every bit of its five-star rating. Firstly, the vacuum's design is sleek and modern, fitting seamlessly into my home's aesthetic. But more importantly, it's incredibly effective. The robot vacuum and mop boasts powerful suction that picks up even the most stubborn dirt and debris from both carpets and hard floors. I have a mix of flooring in my home, including thick rugs and hardwood, and this little machine handles all surfaces with ease. One of the standout features is its intelligent mapping and navigation system. The robot vacuum and mop uses advanced sensors and a sophisticated algorithm to map out my home and plan the most efficient cleaning route. This means no more random, haphazard movements or missed spots. It even remembers the layout of my house for future cleanings, making each session faster and more efficient. The mopping function is equally impressive. The robot vacuum and mop has a dedicated water tank and a mop attachment that can be easily installed. It uses a controlled water release system to ensure that the floor gets just the right amount of moisture, avoiding any water damage. My floors have never looked cleaner or shinier. I especially appreciate that it can tackle sticky spots and stains with its dual scrubber action. Another feature I love is the programmable cleaning schedule. With the companion app, I can set up a cleaning routine that fits my lifestyle. Whether I want a quick clean every morning or a deep clean on weekends, the robot vacuum and mop handles it all autonomously. The app also sends me notifications about the vacuum's status, including when the dustbin needs emptying or if it encounters an obstacle. Speaking of obstacles, the robot vacuum and mop is excellent at navigating around furniture and avoiding falls down stairs. The anti-collision and anti-drop sensors work flawlessly, providing peace of mind, especially when I run it while I'm not at home. The battery life is another major plus. On a full charge, it runs for about 150 minutes, which is more than enough to clean my entire house in one go. When the battery runs low, it automatically returns to its charging dock, so it's always ready for the next cleaning session. In conclusion, the robotic vacuum and mop is a stellar robotic vacuum and mop that has exceeded my expectations in every way. It's powerful, intelligent, and incredibly convenient, making my life so much easier. If you're looking for a top-notch cleaning solution that delivers outstanding performance, look no further than the robot vacuum and mop. It's worth every penny and then some!","Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2024"
B0D9W3B622,5,Bye Bye pet hair,"This thing is wonderful . First impressions matter, and this robot vacuum does not disappoint with its sleek, modern design. It fits seamlessly into any home decor and easily navigates different floor types, from hardwood to tile. The build quality feels solid and durable, which is reassuring in a device that needs to withstand regular usage. This Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo has exceeded my expectations. It successfully merges the functionalities of vacuuming and mopping, effectively making my cleaning routine more convenient and efficient. While it may not replace the need for occasional deep cleaning, it certainly maintains a high standard of daily cleanliness with minimal effort on my part.","Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2024"
B0D9W3B622,5,Great product!,"I've been using the Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo for a few days now, and overall, I'm quite impressed. Here's my take on it: Performance: This little gadget packs quite a punch with its 1400Pa suction. It handles pet hair and dust on my hardwood floors effortlessly. It even does a decent job on my low pile carpet, though I wouldn't rely on it for deep cleaning. The mopping function is a nice bonus. It’s not going to replace a thorough mop, but it's great for quick cleanups and keeping the floors looking tidy. Ease of Use: The app integration is a game-changer. I can start, stop, and schedule cleanings from my phone, which is super convenient. It’s also compatible with WiFi, so I can control it even when I’m not home. The robot returns to its charging station on its own, which is one less thing to worry about. Design: It's slim enough to get under most of my furniture, and it's relatively quiet, so it doesn't disturb the household. The dustbin and water tank are easy to remove and clean, which I appreciate. Limitations: It’s not perfect, though. Sometimes it struggles with navigation, especially in rooms with a lot of obstacles. I’ve had to rescue it a few times when it got stuck. The mopping function could be a bit more powerful, but it’s decent for light cleaning. Final Thoughts: For the price, this Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo is a solid investment for maintaining clean floors with minimal effort. It’s especially useful if you have pets or a busy schedule. Just keep in mind it’s best for maintenance rather than deep cleaning.","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024"
B0D9W3B622,5,Great affordable & efficient vacuum,"This is the second robot vacuum I have purchased. The combination of the two is amazing and makes my life so much easier. The vacuum gets up all of my pet's hair as well as the crumbs my kids leave around. Just be sure to pick up anything that the unit can get stuck on. I have a fairly worn rug by my door that I've noticed the unit will get stuck on from time to time. I love that I can set up a schedule for this robot from the app or use the remote. This unit is quite and smooth. I'd say mighty but fierce. The mop feature is great. I was worried it would just dump water on the floor and just push it around, but it actually gets the job done without leaving anything behind. The only negative thus far is that sometimes it can get a little lost in a room when you send it ""home"". It just takes a little longer to find its way back. I highly recommend this little guy! We will be purchasing another one for our second floor.","Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2024"

B0D9W3B622,5,Best Robo-Vac on the Market!!,"I received this vacuum as a birthday gift from my mother, and really didn’t expect too much from such an inexpensive item. I am happy to report that I was completely wrong! This little guy is AMAZNG!!! Most of the robo-vacuums I have seen with really good reviews are much more expensive, but my Mom swore it worked great. I told her I would try it, but didn’t expect much as compared to my regular vacuum. In it’s first run, it picked up an incredible amount of hair, lint, dirt, and other items that my regular (and lots more expensive!) vacuum had missed - and I had just vacuumed two days ago! I train horses for hours each day, and we breed and raise Missouri Foxtrotters, so I know we bring in a lot of dirt, mud, hay and feed into the garage (which invariably gets into the house when we park our cars or just walk in the garage. Most of what we track in are little items that apparently, by the looks of what we find in the tray, are ground in the carpet and too small for us to see - or our big vacuum to pick up! This fantastic little vacuum gets everything the big vacuum misses! It it VERY quiet, and my husband (who is very non-techy) can run it without frustration! I am very techy, and love the programming features on the remote. It arrived in just a few days, and came with replacement parts so I won’t have to purchase a replenishment kit for awhile. It runs on our carpeting and tile with ease, and has no trouble getting under furniture or climbing up on area rugs. I really like that the filter, tray, etc., are washable, and the brushes/HEPA filter doesn’t have to just be thrown away when it gets dirty. It runs for two hours before charging, can be programmed to run where you need it, and it always finds it’s way back to the charger when it needs charged! I’m not sure how I have lived without this product for 50 years, and I am so glad my Mom insisted that I try it! I am now purchasing a second one for our upstairs! I cannot give this remarkable machine enough stars!! Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,5,"Affordable, quiet and do the job.","It won't pick up all the hairs from my dog(husky), but there's a huge difference that I can see clean floors with just a couple hairs here and there on the carpet side but it's okay, I'm happy with this little vacuum. I had bought a Euby it was fine but I needed more power, so I returned it and got a self empty vacumm, I returned it too because it was too noisy, then got a pair of little vacumms (square ones) cheap but no they didn't do the job, so I was going to get back the euby but the price has increased, so I found this imartine vacumm and decided to give it a try, it was a good price and now I won't think on returning it, it's doing her job at 8 am and then at 6. I come from work to clean floors! Love it, the only reason I'm not giving it 5 🌟 is because it needed just like two feet of 🧲 strips and the remote needs and option for two timers to have scheduled cleaning. But other than that, I'm thinking in buying a second one for my rooms upstairs. I forgot to add that between the vacuums that I bought imartine was the only one smart enough to find the base and go charge itself, even when the base is right in the center, the others would dance around and sometimes I have to carry them myself and plug it in, but not this one it'll take a couple mins to go from one room to another and find the base, but at the end it finds it and goes slow to make sure it's dock properly it's like watching those space capsules get together ;)","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,5,Best purchase ever!,"Ok so I just got this little guy today. If my opinion changes I’ll come back and update my review. I took him out of the box and right away he was ready to go. So I put him on the auto mode and left him go. I vacuum weekly with a Kirby. I have 4 kids and a Rottweiler. I watched this guy start to go and thought “awww that’s cute.” I didn’t expect much. The battery died quickly, I think because I didn’t charge it first. I went to empty it and I couldn’t believe what it picked up. It was so quiet, I couldn’t hear the dirt being picked up like with the Kirby so I assumed it wasn’t doing a great job. (Don’t get me wrong, it’s not QUIET but it’s not loud and you don’t get that typical vacuum sound.) Wow. I was amazed. The compartment that holds the dirt was full. I couldn’t believe it. It had picked up a quarter and a little screw from my sons room. I liked that I could dump it out and look through what it sucked up. I charged him up and once charged I let him go all through my house. He transitions between carpet and hard floors with no problem. He even went over the welcome mat at the front door and my bathroom rug. When he almost dies he goes back to the base and figured out how to hook on and charges. It’s so cute. Now I’ve never had any other brand of robotic vacuum but I feel this is well worth my money! The remote works well, too! I plan on letting this guy run daily. You can schedule a time for him to run but I haven’t explored that yet. So cool!","Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,5,Amazing Vacuum,"This vacuum has been amazing so far. I bought the cheapest vacuum that I could afford when I moved out of my parents house. I needed something to keep the pet hair off the floor but not super expensive. Since then, my vacuum has died (4 years which is not bad for a $40 vacuum). My husband and I were looking at buying a nice vacuum. I noticed this one on sale for about the same price as the traditional vacuum. I read the reviews that said its really good on everything from hardwood floors to medium pile carpet. So we got it. This thing has picked up so much dirt and gunk. I have vacuumed everyday since I got it and the dust bin has been full each time. Its gross to think that my other guy was just not holding up anymore. We have used this on grooved hardwood, that fake tile stuff, and low pile rugs. It has worked great on all. I will be testing it out on medium pile carpet tonight. So we will see how that goes. The only negative things I have to say is that you really need to make sure you pick up all your wires off the floor. This little guy will get tangled in them. But that was listed as something in the manual so I can't complain that much. *Edit: I just used this on my office which has medium pile carpet. All I have to say is ""EW!"" I cannot believe how much stuff there was on the carpet. The bin filled up and the room is tiny.","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2019"
B0D9W3B622,5,Love it !!!,"I started looking at robot vacuums and I read that I should spend 500.00 or more for a good smart vacuum. The reviews for the more expensive vacuums only reached 4 stars in most cases. Then I happened across this one under 200.00 and the reviews were 4.7 percent almost 5 stars across the board. I decided not to judge the little robot right away, and give it a chance. Now I want to name it!!! Lol. It surpassed my expectations by a mile. It has a quirk with setting the auto run, and there is no WiFi, but who cares. I’ve run it 5 times so far and it’s gotten stuck 3... all human errors. Every time I have run it, it has found new dust and crumbs among other things from under the couches and beds, where I could never reach before! Since I can run it every day I am sure my floor and house will be cleaner than ever before, in my life! The run time is estimated @120 minutes but there is only one bedroom with carpet so it runs even longer than that. I thought that area rugs might be a problem, but it has no problem even if the carpet flips up, it just keeps going without a problem. It runs relatively quiet, I mean how quiet can a vacuum be? It it is very acceptable. It does what it states from the manufacturer. For my first robot vacuum I am so pleased that I purchased this one. As time goes by I will update my experience with this machine. If you are considering this robot vacuum I don’t think you would be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,5,My first robot Vacuum. It works!,"I've always been suspicious that robot vacuums are more of a fad then a functional product. But now that they've been on the market for about a decade, I decided to try one. I didn't want to spend too much money, so I went with this product due to the cost and reviews. I run it on our main floor which is 100% hardwood, though it does go over some rugs with no issues. I'm not sure how it would vacuum a carpet against a wall since you can't ""sweep"" dust off a carpet like it does the floor, but for hardwood floors this is perfect. Frankly, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I run it every day and it has replaced the daily need to sweep. The only prep work I have to do before it runs is to do a quick walk around and pick up socks and electrical cables that may be laying across the floor. Everything else it handles on it's own. 100% satisfied after 1 full month of daily use. No signs of wear or damage to the unit. One note, I did not create a scheduled time for it to run daily so I could just choose when I wanted it to run. However, it started by itself every day (about 2:55pm) even though the schedule function was not enabled. To fix, I had to set a scheduled time, and then set it to disabled. Now it no longer starts by itself.","Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2021"
B0D9W3B622,5,Gets the dog hair,"I have a black dog and light colored hardwood floors. I was very annoyed coming home every day and immediately noticing the hair as soon as I walked in. We Swiffered at least once a day, sometimes up to 3 times. We spent way too much time swiffering. I decided my time was more valuable than that so I researched robot vacuums. This one had great reviews and was in my price range. It gets almost all of the dog hair and a lot of dust that I didn't realize was there also. I say almost only because it has trouble getting to some spots in the edges of rooms. No fault of the vacuum, there are objects that it just can't get around. The dog got used to it after just a couple of days. I have a few throw mats in my kitchen that it goes over, but not easily. It pulls up the edges and has trouble getting over them, but eventually does. I now pick them up ahead of time. It ran over a small ball of yarn and it got tangled, stopping the vacuum. It lets out a series of beeps to let you know when it's stuck. It seems to run about an hour and a half to two hours before it gets tired and returns itself to its home. I pause it once during this time to empty the dust bin and shake off the filter. The roller brush and sweepers are easily detachable to get the long hairs out. I am very pleased with this vacuum. We've named him Martin.","Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,5,Pleasantly surprised,"I am lazy but my wife is a clean freak so I needed a shortcut to contribute to house cleaning. After reading tons of review for various robot vacs, I got paralysis by analysis. My main criteria was clearance under furniture (less than 3"" in some cases) followed by budget/risk ratio and no cameras. Eventually I chose the iMartine. I cannot comment yet for long term reliability but the idea was that I would rather risk $150 vs $5-600 in case it doesn't work out. The vac came very well packaged and partially charged. It is slim and super quiet and does not freak out our cat. It's pretty fascinating to watch it run, and the cleaning algorithm is pretty smart for a random vac and I suspect it's learning; once it bumps into a molding, if it returns to it, it stops short of it and turns. I am surprised how much dust it picks up on hardwood floors that seem clean. It does return successfully to the charging base although if it's lost in some bedroom, it may take a while. Battery lasts a long time (ran it for 2 hrs in normal mode and was still ok); overall it's a great value considering that I no longer lift beds and move couches. The remote control signs are a bit confusing but once you learn them it's all good. The front bumper lense is a dust magnet but easy to wipe. Overall I am very happy with this product.","Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2019"
B0D9W3B622,5,Can't believe how well this works across all surfaces and pet hair!,"Since I have retired, I spend a lot of time putzing and consider my house very clean. I have been running ""Traveling Robert"" for a week and am amazed how at much dust and pet hair it still picks up. I have 2 cats and felt that I needed a little more vacuuming to overcome the hair dust. It easily navigates both my tile floor as well as the medium pile living area rug and a few smaller rugs throughout the house. Most of the throw rugs are non slip backing so he just goes over it. The vacuum clicks into higher suction as soon as it notices the higher pile. I do have a step down to the Florida room and have never had a ""fall"". It runs for about an hour and a half before returning to home for recharging and easily cleans our 1600 sq ft home pretty thoroughly. So far I am extremely pleased and the cats just supervise to watch that everything gets done :-) I empty the dust bin after each day but could probably go 2 days with ease. I like that it picks up the very fine dust that you don't even notice unless you wear white socks. Just make sure any rug ravels are trimmed and cords and cables are away or secure. I set the timer on the remote and it starts cleaning on the dot each day.","Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,5,It works on all surfaces and is less noisy than regular vacuums,"Video of vacuum on hard tile to high pile and low pile rugs. Good robotic vacuum. I hesitated to buy one for years because I have thick pile carpets and many step ups and step down levels in my home. This vacuum managed all surfaces: hardwood,low pile and high pile carpets. It manages my scatter rugs and even my teak wood bathroom mats. I wish I'd bought it sooner. I do have to lower it to all my one and three steps down in the house. That is to be expected as it backs away when it encounters a cliff. I just run separate programs for different levels. It also goes neatly under furniture that is more than a couple inches off the ground. The furniture that has a clearance of less than a couple inches , it goes halfway under and backs out. I have an issue in particular area of my steps down to the conversation pit around my fireplace, where it has stopped 2x now and beeped that it was stuck. I think that the combination of rails, carpeted tiny 15""half steps, and furniture is confusing to it. This is the only problem I have encountered and think it's particular to me alone. I never realized how much cat hair is on my floors until I started emptying the vacuum after use. I love this gadget.

With all of us home, all of the time, I got this great little robot vacuum to help. In 4 days it has cleaned all 2,000 plus square feet of our tiled home, including under and behind the furniture, better than the more expensive upright. Make sure you clean the tray everyday because it picks up everything, including a lost earring and one missing holiday check. I recommend you run it when you are home. It is quiet but some times gets stuck on a cord or cat toy and beeps for you to come get it. If you have pets or kids, you do not want it running through a spill and spreading it. Not to mention the cats chase it and our very large, very old and blind dog has stepped on it twice. It is a tough resilient little machine which ignores the cats and cleans around the dog.

It is quiet, and made fairly quick work of the floors. (I admit I need to move things around so that the little robot can maneuver a bit easier, but it does a wonderful job of detecting an object, and moving in a different direction. (or trying to go around it.) Nothing makes you feel like a terrible housekeeper quite like a robot with a full dust tray. Well that's it's problem now! Seemed to have no issue picking up the usual pieces of stuff one finds on the floor (nothing big, it doesn't do capri sun wrappers that I didn't know I had). The only 'issue' it had, was after doing my entire floor (600 sqf?), it had collected my very long hair in it's brushes - no surprise. I shed like a sheepdog since i've had cancer treatment. Quick snip snip and it's bristles were free to find something else to gnaw on. Probably the best purchase i've made this month.

B0D9W3B622,5,Great first impressions,"""Martine"" has been in action in our home for a week now. First impressions are good. Suction power is good it seems to pick everything up OK on either hard floors or carpet. Its also nice and quiet it can be running right next to you without being offensive at all (unlike our big vacuum that requires ear defenders) In terms of autonomy it does appear to be fairly simple but effective. If you put it into a relatively simple room such as a bedroom or bathroom and close the door it does a great job. However let loose in the open plan living room / kitchen / dining room it can get a little confused. Make sure to pick everything loose up off the floor and be aware of cables etc. In summary it is not bad but may require you to keep an eye on it if you have a lot of furniture, cables, etc. To add to this the return to docking station feature works OK when there is a relatively simple path back but it may struggle if there is a lot of obstacles in the way. Overall I am definitely happy with the functionality at the price point. You can literally pay 10x the price for a robot vacuum if you desire!","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019"

First you can't beat the price of it. Second the thing is a beast at tackling dog hair. (Long haired German Shepherd that sheds like crazyyyyy). The first day I used it I was like what is it doing because it was going in weird zig zags and bouncing room to room before it finished one. I let it do its thing and when it was done I walked through and checked every room and there was no dirt or hair found even along the edges and under the couch. I used to have to vacuum everyday and it took so much time out of my day now once I wake up I just push the start button and get my other things done. The thing is a life saver. I personally don't use the schedule because I worry my dog would view it as a toy at times, and there is one spot in my house that it gets stuck so I want to be able to grab it.

My home is 2500 square feet and I am a minimalist-meaning there is plenty of open space. I was amazed at how well it cleaned the floor under my bed. I plan to use this to supplement cleaning the floors at nights after work or on weekends when I am just too tired to deep clean- but my floors will need to a deep vacuuming/sweeping on a regular basis.

I have a Roomba 675 for another level, so I have something to compare with the iMartine Robotic Vacuum. First of all, this does an excellent job keeping up with the kitty litter and lint balls from the dryer in my basement. It doesn't have all the fancy bells, whistles and WIFI that some other models have, but it really doesn't need it. It has several different cleaning modes and the cleaning pattern does a great job cleaning the basement rooms. It hasn't gotten stuck and the charging base has a great cord management system. It does the job and does it much quieter than the Roomba 675. The ONLY thing keeping me from buying a second one is that although it's advertised with anti-drop technology, the instructions that come with it direct you to block off stairs to keep it from falling. That conflict of information bothers me. Other than that, if you are looking for a simple no-frills robotic vacuum which runs almost $100 less than a similar Roomba, this is a good choice.","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2020"

One day the unit broke down and the support was great. We sent some pictures and a video of the issue and they send us a brand new unit. It was supposedly an issue with the motherboard. Those things can happen and now we are happy with our second unit. The this price it is unbeatable in our opinion. The remote we really don't use so much. Usually just to send it home to the base if we think the room is clean enough. The kids use it more to clean their rooms to use it as a remote like for a car.

B0D9W3B622,5,"Daisy does it all, that's what I call my little robot","I love this thing, it cleans my house every night and I only have to clean her every other day, every 3rd day or so, she goes from room to room with no problem, she cleans under the table and around the chairs, she goes from hardwood to tile with ease and its also very quiet or not as loud as I would have thought it to be, this is a must-have, but your floors cant have stuff all over the place, and it will knock a lamp over if the cord gets stuck in it, you cant have stuff laying around or it will get stuck on stuff. I have had it for more than a month and it goes off every night at the same time it cleans for about 2 hours then goes home on its own, I don't have to worry about it after it starts up, it cleans by the stairs and doesn't fall down them I love this thing we call her daisy.","Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2021"
B0D9W3B622,5,Be ready for trial and error but 100% worth it,"My place has never been cleaner! The day I set it up, I sent videos and pictures to my friends and family (It’s sad but it was truly the highlight of my week) After some trial and error, this vacuum is exactly what I’ve been looking for! I have no stairs in my home so I can’t attest to the sensor (the manual says to put a barrier up so it doesn’t take a tumble). But I can say that this sucks up hair and dust like no other, switching from carotene to tile with ease! Before I bought this, I checked the reviews and people had trouble with scheduling feature. Initially, I did too but after reading the included manual, it clearly says to set the time and the scheduled run time while being close to the vacuum itself. If done correctly, the vacuum will beep. Problem solved. Other minor issues I encountered was the charging dock getting moved by the vacuum and the vacuum getting caught behind/under a recliner. Minor fixes. Totally worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,5,Holy cow!,"Got it yesterday, charged it all night. set it free twice today. my home is 3,200 sq ft. and mostly hard floors. I thought I might need two. This little guy swept up tiny dust particles. I was expecting the big stuff gone. Don't get me wrong, I keep a clean house, at least I thought that I did. We live in our home, and stuff hits the floor, not laundry or trash, but stuff tracked in, etc.. and we have a cat. That is what I was expecting to find when I cleaned the dust pan. BUT NO, I found tiny dust particles. The other stuff was there, but, ya know when you sweep, and vacuum up what you swept up, then turn around and there is another dust bunny..I think this sucker is sucking up those fly away dust bunnies! I'm impressed. Is just one day with it. I'm a little tight. I watch my spending. The cost of this little guy was the same as one visit from house keeper. So far, I am in love!!!!!!","Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,5,Notable difference in our home,"So first I would like to comment on the customer service, I initially bought this product in January and I have literally used it 2-3 times a week because we have serious allergies. It has worked way better than expected but last month one of the legs stopped working, I wrote an email to customer support, sent a video of the issue and they responded quickly and exchanged it for a new one! Pros: 1. I don't change my air conditioning filter as frequently. 2. Easy to clean and you can see how effective it is after every use. 3. When I mop, there is a noticeable difference in the towelette I use. 4. Eases my allergies and picks up all our new puppies hair (and ours) 5. CLEAN HOUSE without all the extra work Cons: 1. It gets stuck on cables so you have to be careful, I only use it when I am home 2. I wish it was a little quieter but it's not early as loud as a vacuum. Worth every penny.","Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,5,Would recommend,"This purchase was to replace a 10 year old irobot. So, I have a comparison. This vacuum is much quieter even at max level as compared to the old one. I can hold a conversation without having to yell. It has a lower profile which means it has an easier time getting under things. That was a struggle with the old one. The compartment is a little smaller than what I'm used to but that's fine. I like the fact that it has two spinning brushes on both sides. It picks up a LOT even after I ran the irobot. So, either the old one was on it's way out or this one has much more suction power. I don't know which. It docks much easier. The old one pushed the docking station around until it got connected. Having a remote is a nice feature. I like that it has different cleaning options. I'll miss having the walls that contained the old vacuum. I guess I'll get used to it. It's not that big of a deal.","Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,5,"Busy and Nosy, Just the Way I Like Vacuum Cleaners!","After much hesitation, research, reviews, and a great lightning sale. I purchased this mighty little cleaner. Can you say yippee! I have carpet, laminate, tile, and rugs and it goes alllllll over them and cleans easily. The best part is it goes right back to its station when it runs out of juice. It saves me a lot of time not having to vacuum and sweep a 3,000 sq foot house. I didn’t realize it went in my bedroom and found a crystal under my bed, it started beeping to let me know it was clogged. I took it out easily and it went on it’s merry way! I have 3 cats and decided to put it on the sofa and guess what, it cleans the sofa too without falling off. You are supposed to block off areas of height like stairs, but it somehow senses danger (at least on the sofa) and reverses its pattern. Only complaint I have is that I wished it did have stairs, lol.","Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,5,Not sure how I’ve survived without this!,"“Runaround Sue” has been a lifesaver for me, especially after knee surgery. I don’t know how I have managed all these years without her. I have 1600 sq ft of hardwood and vinyl plank floors, along with two dogs and a cat. Need I say more? She was quick to unbox and set up. The instructions were all in English, and I had the remote programmed in no time. She had some hurdles she became stuck on (my fault) but after I repositioned the tv cable and register cover, she was off and running again. She is able to fit under most of my furniture, and I definitely see and feel a difference in how clean the floors are. I watched her venture towards the edge of the steps into the back room, and she was always able to sense the drop off and turn around. The filter is easy to remove and clean, and I am amazed with what “treasures” she is able to pick up. I highly recommend Runaround Sue” for anyone needing this amazing robot cleaner!","Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,5,iMartine the Time Saver,"Have to say, I'm shocked at how well this works! I was a total skeptic, but saw it discounted and thought to give it a whirl. I own a rabbit so need to vacuum way too frequently than I'd like. Lol This baby cleans so well that I was mortified to see how dirty my floors actually were! 😬 I'm praying it lasts a good while because I really love it and actually find it fun to clean now! I like to leave reviews when I'm happy with products or customer service and give credit where credit is due. Happy to recommend iMartine!👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 UPDATE December 2022: I'm scared to jinx it, but happy to say my relationship with my iMartine is still going strong!

Now granted, I’ve only had it for a few days...BUT my floors are so much cleaner and it makes me happy! I’m getting other things done while the ‘robot’ as I call it is cleaning the floors for me. It allows me to be much more efficient with my time. I hate sweeping. This is so worth it! Oh yeah , it also worked GREAT ON MY CARPET! If you have any hesitation, listen to me- BUY IT! You’ll be glad you did. I don’t give reviews usually, and I’m gonna get better about that. I do base my purchases off of them and I should really start writing them more. Y’all this thing is awesome!

B0D9W3B622,5,Easy to use no fuss,"Love this vacuum it’s easy to clean, even when you have to clean the filters and brushes. Super simple to use with the remote, it only has ‘directional’ issues with one piece of furniture I have but it is a very strange base that the furniture has, and it doesn’t allow the bump sensor to be triggered and allow the vacuum to move away easily otherwise it’s awesome with getting around the house and finding its way back to the charging dock. We have 4 different types of carpets and it works on them all perfectly fine, even my extra plushy bath mats. It may get stuck on a small area rug/door mat if a corner is flipped up, but it doesn’t take long for the vacuum to beep and let you know that it’s stuck so it never ruined my rugs even in the slightest. Over all I would recommend this if you want a vacuum that is simple and no fuss with Wi-Fi, and gets under a majority of your furniture","Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2019"
B0D9W3B622,5,Game Changer,"Loving my iMartine. I wasn't looking for anything crazy, I just wanted to come home to less dog fur on my hardwood floors. This little machine does a great job and makes me happy to walk through the door. It decided to try this brand based on the positive reviews and price point. It even had a $30 off coupon. It holds a lot of fur and transitions from room to room well. It hasn't gotten stuck other than a saddle that is a bit too high and I have a corner of my living room with multiple furniture pieces and it zooms in, bops around and finds it way back out. My animals are not afraid of it and it has even bumped into them and they don't seem to care.

I have 3 dogs and one of them sheds a lot. It does great with getting up all the fur. I’ve figured out the areas where it will sometimes get stuck and I just block those off with a throw pillow or something while I run it. I clean out the roller, empty it and clean up the filter every day. The dust issue in my house has decreased immensely. I run it on carpet, vinyl plank, and tile, it works great on all 3. It goes over my throw rugs wonderfully and cleans those up great as well. I have sort of a big transition from my vinyl to my tile and it gets over it with no problem.","Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2021"

It was frustrating cause he would eat stuck in places or would continue to clean on my bar benches for a good while like he was being stubborn about cleaning the bottom of it when it’s like “it’s already clean now continue to another area”. Anyway, it would do the job until recently where he just stopped working. I turn him in and he was about to start and then he just turns in circles and turns off so it has to be his wheel but I can’t fix that. I’ve looked and there’s nothing stuck so now I can’t use him.

It runs for 1 1/2 hours and I use the cleaning schedule function. The only small issue I have with it is sometimes it seems to get stuck in a loop and takes a minute to figure it out.

B0D9W3B622,5,Great for hardwood floors,"We love this little robot. We are a two person, two dog household and we all shed. Outside, our soil is super sandy so we are constantly tracking it inside as well. This little robot has no problem cleaning our 1200 square foot all wood and tile floor house on one charge. He’s a little dumb and seems to visit the same places frequently, but he gets the job done. Since having him and running him once a day, I haven’t once had to sweep and can now walk barefoot all the time. The only thing he doesn’t excel at is going over our two small yarn rugs. He pushes them around because they are so light and the wooden floor is so slick.

I have a lot of furniture and it took some time to get in and out of small spaces but it picked up all the cat hair. I have 2 cats and a dog and my life was spent just trying to keep the hair under control. I call him Bob and Bob has saved me hours and I can now breathe easier without the constant pet hair floating around from my broom and vacuum. Life saver. Definitely worth the modest price.

We live in farm country so it can get dusty here pretty quick, I am thrilled with how much this little gem picks up. Also we have an Australian shepherd that sleeps under our bed and this little vacuum just zooms right on under there. I have to clean the roller brush regularly, every 20-30 minutes, because of his hair but they have made that simple to do and the tool they provide helps. You need to be very aware of what's on your floor before letting it loose, I unplug and pick up everything I can, including light weight rugs, because it will take stuff for a ride and get tangled up if you don't.","Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2020"

Definitely a good value for the money. We use it primarily for hardwood floors, and so far it's picking up everything we'd expect it to. Dust, lint, crumbs around the table, dog hair. One of my primary reasons for purchasing this unit was the suction power and the decibel rating. It's very quiet. The travel pattern is random - really random. But that's what I paid for.

It also has a remote control that allows you to steer it in any direction if you need some specific clean up and an edge function that will send it vacuuming along your baseboards. It's relatively quiet and doesn't shoot particles out to the side like another brand of robot vacuum that I found overall inefficient and had to return. It is able to roam up onto a thick shag carpet insert much to my surprise and also has an extra boost feature for more power.

Suction is great! Sucked up a bunch of dried cat food my cats knocked over. Also emptying the bin in really easy and mess free. Last year I purchased a high end brand name robot vacuum (I named Bob). After a few months there were multiple problems. Supposedly I could diagnose them and fix with the online app, but I had switched wifi routers and Bob would not work with the wifi anymore.

Sure, sometimes it takes several runs to do a decent job in my large living/dining/kitchen space that's full of obstacles, but it gets the job done. So far I've only dealt with the minor maintenance of clearing the brushes after a couple of cycles and emptying the bin. Handles hair and chunks pretty well, and is pretty good around the edges too. If you're still thinking about a robot vac and don't want to spend too much, this is a great place to start. Even if it only lasts a year or two, it'll be a great value.

Overall I'm very happy with the purchase. UPDATE: After further use, the vacuum jumping from hardwood floor to rug has improved. The vacuum now transitions easily between the two and it is smart enough to engage max power when it detects the rug.

The only issues I have had is we have 2 chihuahuas. They absolutely bark nonstop at the robot.

B0D9W3B622,5,C800 is an excellent little robot vac,"This machine gets the fine dirt also. The first two times, I was away. It sucked up so much. I was really impressed. The third time, I watched as it moved about the floor. The filter and the dirt tray were easy to wash the fine dust away in the sink. The handy brush tool to sweeps the fine dust away in the dirt tray and filter. The tool also has a blade to cut hair on the middle roller brush The instructions were clear and helpful. This was my first robot vac. It does make some noise. The yarn fringe on on the edge of rugs can get caught in the front spinning brushes and wires also. It is best to supervise. Check it is not hung up on a rug or something.","Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,5,Great Purchase,I've used my vacuum about 3-4 times and am very pleased with it. It has worked so much better than expected. I have laminate flooring (and a few rugs) on my first floor - about 900 sq ft. The vacuum cleaned the floors and rugs very well. I love the way it cleaned along the baseboards. I didn't have any problems with the vacuum getting stuck or hung up anywhere. It thoroughly cleaned my entire first floor before the charge ran low. I wish I had purchased one of these robotic vacuums a lot sooner. (It was also fun to watch the vacuum make it's way back to the charging station when the battery got low.),"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,5,This is a great little workhorse!,"Love this little workhorse. I run him 3x a week and his tray comes back full almost every time. I have 3 small dogs with short hair and live near the beach so lots of pet hair and sand. I have not hand swept or vacuumed since i bought this 3 weeks ago. I also take it upstairs 2x a week. I need another one! I only have one low pile throw rug, but it seems to work great on that as well as my tile floors. It runs for about an hour and a half before returning for a charge. I do have to supervise as it gets stuck under the edge of the sofa and recliners.","Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2019"

Under my entertainment center my low living room table. It is very slim so it can sneak into low places. He ran for 2 + hours and was still moving when I decided he had worked hard enough and sent him home. WELL that was amazing to watch,lol. He is so smart !! I recommend him 150% !!

B0D9W3B622,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE!,"When I first purchased the IMartine, I was skeptical. We have 2 dogs and 2 cats (all INSIDE). The first time I ran Marty (as we lovingly call her), I followed her around the house watching her work. She ran for a VERY long time before she beeped at me to let me know she was full. OMG the stuff that came out was crazy. She got stuck under the couch so you might want to raise your couch up a little if it's low or block it off. Marty works way harder than I ever had while sweeping the floor! The dogs and cats are a little afraid which is hysterical!

It does not go down stairs, and returns to its' docking station when it is running low on battery charge. As I have many animals and a dog grooming business, I sweep, then vacuum. Even still, Imartine gets up more so I can mop. I have been using this for a while before writing a review. I definitely recommend this product. Plus it comes with a manual!

It would do the transition from my carpet to kitchen without issue, but does NOT fall down the stairs, it detects that drop! It picked up so much including short dog hair, long human hair, dust, twist ties, grass, crumbs, even a carabiner I missed. It did go over large round cords (like orange extension cords) without issue or without getting jammed. It also fits under my couch and ottoman! It has very low noise and gets going!

The suction is great, it easily transitions from hard surfaces to carpets and rugs with no problems. It gets closer to the edges than my traditional vacuum cleaner. We have different floor levels so I have to move it around a bit to get the jobs done. The cleaning pattern seems very irregular but so far it looks like it is doing a complete job. The amount of material it picks up is amazing.

The vaccum just come on randomly now and only sweeps for a few minutes and then shuts off like the battery is dead after being on the charger all day.

I've been wanting one of these for a while, but I couldn't bring myself to spend hundreds of dollars. This lil robot vac rocks, AND the price is right! It travels through the house easily and rarely gets stuck. I'm amazed (and embarrassed) as to how much cat hair and dirt picks up. You will need a good space for it to dock, so be mindful of that.

This i Martine C800 is a little workhorse. Picks up fine dust particles and hair and does a thorough job. I have concrete floors throughout my home with area carpets, and it was a problem to keep them dust free.

We no longer have pet hair all over our dark wood floors and the cleaner even gets hard to reach places our regular vacuum can't. The first time we used the cleaner we had to wipe off the top and empty the bin several times. Was amazed and disgusted by how much dirt and hair was picked up.

Unfortunately one of the arms of the rotating arms broke off (the brush part fell out) but there are still two on that one; I could easily change it out but it's working well enough with two at this time. Every now and then it doesn't want to start working right away and I have to turn the switch on the underside off and back on which makes it wake up.

B0D9W3B622,5,Good enough for what you pay.,"Overall, the product is great, for what you pay. Knowing what I know now, I would have gone for a more expensive option, that has the mapping feature. This robot cleans well, it does the job, but it cleans very randomly and it could get annoying watching it clean the same patch over and over, while some spots get untouched - I find myself using the remote control very often for that reason. I have three small dogs, who shed and the robot, picks up all the hair wither an issue. If you leave it long enough, it will clean the house, I would not recommend it, if you have tick carpets and rugs. Fare price for what you get!","Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2020"

I love that I can use the remote and guide her over spots that need more attn but also love that she can just roam around and get everything on her own. Her battery its a good hour and half and she puts herself back on her charger when needed. The only advice I can give someone considering this, is make sure you move any thin cords out of the way, like cell phone charging cords. Shes easy to clean and comes with extra spare parts.

B0D9W3B622,4,Sucks up dog fur just fine.,"I purchased this robot vacuum from Amazon about a month ago, based on the hope that it would indeed sweep up our dogs' fur (2 furry monsters live with us). It does, especially when put into the sweep-the-edges of the room mode. The amount of fur and miscellaneous dust has steadily decreased since I first started using it. The remote control increases the robot's capabilities considerably (I've misplace the remote and hope to find it soon; in the meantime I've ordered what I hope is the same remote at Amazon, but which is sold under another brand name (""Amarey"")). Why only 4 stars? The robot ""hangs up"" on raised thresholds, so I have to go over to the machine and give it a push to allow it to continue to proceed. Also, there's no warning lights or sounds when the robot gets trapped somewhere. Finally, the printed owner's manual that comes with the device has print and icons that are frequently in a light green color that is almost impossibly difficult for my elderly eyes to read. (The company was responsive to my request to forward me a PDF copy of the manual, which I can ""blow up"" to a size where I can decipher what's written there.) NOTE: The brand name for the vacuum I bought at Amazon was ""iMartine"" (which as of 13Nov2019 is unavailable) but the same product line is still sold under the name ""Coredy"" (at the iMartine.com website) and ""Amarey"" (a name that appears at the website in the Personal Info usage area, where it states ""...amarey may use this information to perform service...""","Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2019"
B0D9W3B622,4,"Nice and Quiet, Doesn't scare the dog","This is our first time trying a robot vacuum and we all love how quiet it is, especially the dog. I bought this for my 80 year old mother, who is not tech savvy. I wanted something more simple so that she would not have to deal with wifi or programming or anything to complicated like that. Though it vacuums in a random pattern it does a pretty complete job of hitting all areas if you let it run long enough. Only drawback that I noticed so far is that it has to be cleaned often. We live in Arizona, so we get lots of dust and my mother's little dog sheds a lot of hair, so the vacuum can't seem to go more than 15 to 20 minutes before the filter gets plugged with dust and hair and it has to be emptied. Also plan on washing out your filter in water after each use or you will have problems next time you go to use it. I suggest having extra filters on hand to you can change them out frequently if needed. In spite of the frequent cleaning my mom says the vacuum is fun to use, unlike her upright vacuum, and she uses the remote to kind of direct it areas she wants it to go and it is kind of like a toy to her, so I know she is enjoying it a lot.","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,4,"Powerful, Yet Affordable Little Robot","My wife and I love this robotic vacuum! It works great and didn't break the bank to purchase. I like that the brushes and filter easily detach so you can clean everything out. The filter is easy enough to replace over time, when necessary too. The suction power of the vacuum is on point, we've been running it pretty much everyday since purchasing it and we empty the dust bin everyday (or every other day). We have a shepherd mix dog who sheds a lot and this vacuum has been working better than our previously owned iRobot. The only thing I would mention as an area of improvement would be the remote control. I programmed the auto-clean feature per the instructions but the vacuum's clock/time-telling functionality seems off. The only issue with this is that the vacuum goes off at AM, instead of PM, seemingly. Some of the other remote features are a bit complicated and don't seem to work quite as well as they're meant to...however, I could just be working things incorrectly or maybe my remote wasn't coded the right way. The remote doesn't really affect my ability to use the vacuum so it's not a major point of contention for me and I would still purchase this vacuum again.

But until they evolve to either not shed or pick up their own hair we are keeping it. My daughter even named it botbot. Picks up hair, even my wife's! Now long hair does get stuck in the roller and sweepers but doesn't affect its performance. Just be sure to clean it out every time. The routes it takes are not very efficient, and sometimes find it doing the same area several times. But the more it works the better it gets. It won't pick up bigger items which can be a little annoying but it also makes sure it's nothing important either. It's a little louder than other units I've looked at but that way I know it's working. Just fades into background noise after a week. This unit isn't perfect and that's perfectly ok I didn't expect it to be. I would of spent 700 if that's what I wanted. The value I get will far exceed the $150 I spent. This saves me time, requires little maintenance. Let's just see how it holds up in 6 months before I give it 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,4,"Even with a defect, this is still a great buy","Since day one, I've had NO LUCK in getting the timer feature to work. I've contacted support and, while extremely polite, recommended I re-perform all of the steps that I previously followed to a ""T"" from the instructions, but to no avail - reset the machine, unplugged the base and tried starting over was of no help (three attempts!) But for the fact that I won't be able to set the timer for it to run at a specifixc time, this machine really works GREAT! I shed, my 3 chihuahuas shed and this thing's become a time-saver!! The collection tray holds a lot! I was shocked to see how much hair this thing collected ... and kinda disgusted to see how much dust too (on the filter) since I consider myself to be quite fastidious in my house cleaning! I let it run while I perform other chores, and by the time I'm done so is the iMartine so I can simply pull out the steam cleaner or mop with the vacuuming already out of the way! Even despite the fact I will never be able to set it on timer mode, this is still a great machine for the price.","Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,4,Very happy,I am very happy with my IMartine. As you can see it had great suction. I had cleaned the same floors with my canister vacuum that has good suction the day before it came. This was my second used of the IMartine and I thought I need to get a photo. I do have a cat that looses a lot of hair even with frequent brushing. I picked this model because it said it does well with medium pile carpet. It goes very easily from my tiled kitchen to my medium pile carpet. I use to have a Rumba that I loved too but I bought it when they first came out years ago. This one actually does a much better job. I’m sure technology has improved. I only gave it a four because the battery life only lasted 45 minutes and it said 120 minutes. If it wasn’t for that it would be a 5+.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2021"
B0D9W3B622,4,Like it better than roomba now,"So I was initially excited. Now after using for a bit I have to say completely unimpressed. I just had it do one room. All hardwood floors and it’s not a large room at all. It ran for 1/2 hour and it was annoying but it happens. I went to lay down the rug and had to sweep the floor. The dust bin in the machine was not hardly full. I don’t know if a Roomba or shark work better but I won’t be finding out. Also can’t get the schedule thing to work. Followed directions and it starts at midnight every night. I have to turn off the power. Not worth it. Update: got a roomba and can’t say I love it. Roomba crashes hard into everything and is so noisy. This one is still quieter than roomba but a bit rattely (is that a word?). I appreciate the quietness of this machine and that it doesn’t crash into everything. If it does come in contact it’s a gentle bump, roomba has moved chairs. So I have decided this one is more my favorite of the two.","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,4,Good product with good price,"I like this vacuum cleaner. It's very good quality and very good price compared to the Rumba. I like the remote control and the different options it gives you. It's relatively quiet and it does a good job picking up dirt and hair. It transitions very well from hard floor to carpet but gets stuck on some rugs. The good think is that if it gets stuck, it turns itself off. I do have to clean the brushes often since the long hair gets wrapped around them, but they are very easy to clean. The battery lasts about 45 minutes, I would've like it to last a little longer, and it does take a few hours to recharge. When the battery is low, if the vacuum is far away from the charger, it takes it a while to find the charger. I guess it doesn't get the signal unless it is about 4-5 feet away from it. We do talk to it as if if was a pet, lol, we actually named it Dori :)","Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2021"
B0D9W3B622,4,Pretty pleased - Updated and Sad,"*UPDATE* just after our buddy’s first bday he’s died. Well, maybe coma is a better word, he won’t charge, cannot reset him because he won’t turn off. And the customer service number in his manual is a dead line. 😢😢😢 I bought this vacuum after my dogs successfully killed 3 standard vacuums in the last 4 years. I have a Newfie and a pittie mix. That said, I fully expected to have this run once and it be returned due to a failed motor. It’s been about 2 weeks since I purchased this little guy and it’s still running strong. We use him every day. That said, we have to clean it’s roller brush after every use. They did provide a fancy little roller brush cleaning tool. Again, I have a Newfie and a pittie mix. If you’re unfamiliar with Newfoundland dogs, she looks like a 140lb muppet. The daily brush cleaning is worth it. My carpet hasn’t looked this good in a long time.

B0D9W3B622,4,4 stars,"Update: 3 and a half months the robot vacuum cleaner worked. Although it has a diligent customer service team. They helped me investigate the cause of why it stopped working. In the end, they offered to replace mine with a new one, but I preferred a refund. So far it has worked excellent. If something else happens I will edit this review. I think it's a good price for everything he does. I like that when it has low battery charge it goes directly to the included charger and connects. And if you want to charge it you just press the button on the remote control that has a house drawn. So far I have used it in my room and it cleans it perfectly. It is quite thin so it goes perfectly under the bed. It also cleans flat carpets but those with fringes get stuck, although I imagine that happens with all robot vacuum cleaners. It doesn't work with Alexa, since it doesn't have WIFI. This one with the remote control that it brings you can handle it very well.","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2019"

Assembly requirements were merely snapping 2 brushes in place and plugging in the recharging post. I could hardly wait for its battery to be charged before I pressed START and off it went. Melvin, which is the name we applied, familiarized itself with all our furniture, rooms, doorways, etc. by banging into each. The very next day Melvin took off and bumped into nothing. It was a wonderment to watch it turn from chair legs, walls. furniture legs and cabinets without hitting one and its returning to the Recharger when I pressed HOME on the Remote Controller. Its large dirt box holds three days of cleaning and the spinning brush picks up all hairs. Emptying the dirt box and cleaning the filter and rotary brush is easy. Our large apartment looks immaculate after each cleaning. Melvin is a joy and has been welcomed to being a Family Member. Melvin is well worth the price and deliverer of pleasure.

B0D9W3B622,4,GOOD LITTLE HOUSEMAID,"We use this bot in a 900 square feet condo, floors are mainly tile and a couple of area rugs of 5 x 7 feet and half a dozen smaller spot rugs. The machine does all the areas very well, is very quiet and surprisingly picks up much dust and hair. It goes about its little run even in places that we would not expect ( like under chairs an around vases etc....) the only thing it has difficulty with are wires on the floor behind the tv or computer desk, it has a tendency to get entangled in the wires. The way that we found around this problem is to put any kind of bar or even broom handle under the furniture just in front of the wires and it will do good with that. The remote control can be programmed for different working times and the bot will go at it for about 1.5 hours and return to its base by itself to recharge. At under 200$ it is a real good buy.","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2019"

I never had a robot vacuum before so the learning curve was a little longer....but really, it was not hard to master. I love the fact that I can direct ""Marcy"" (that's what I've named her!) to run around the edges of the kitchen where I seem to drop stuff all the time, I noticed that she didn't pick up fresh food as well...like a piece of carrot or turkey. Then I can direct her to do the rest of the kitchen and proceed to the living room. She had no problem going from tile to carpet and from carpet to a rug on top of the carpet. I only have a one floor house so the fact that she doesn't stop going down stairs won't be an issue. I love my IMartine...

Im still new to it, its only been a day but i have noticed wgile its auto cleaning that after some time it just stops and i dont know if its due to being full or the battery died before it could make it back to its base or what.

Unbeknownst to me - I set a schedule when reviewing the remote for the first time. But it worked well. The unit takes about an 1 1/2 hours and finally returned to the base on its own. Just have to be careful with certain throw rugs. The rugs in my bathroom get stuck and I have to retrieve the unit. Simply I close the bathrooms doors when it starts. I do hear the sucking power change when going from area rug to hard floors. Wry pleased with that. I am very pleased and would recommend this unit.

PROs: - Reasonable price - Washable filter - Not too loud - Good for short dog hair - Transitions between hardwood floor and low carpet very easily CONs: - One of the brushes arrived bent - It runs into objects 50% of the time but the sensor catches other times (this is however, better than my old Roomba). - Auto-clean setting left lots of uncleaned areas. The lack of mapping technology shows here. - It gets stuck on the oddest things, but instead of alerting that it's stuck or gliding over the obstacle (in this case a fan base) it just keeps obsessively cleaning the one area.","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2021"
B0D9W3B622,4,great little vaccuum,"this unit is much more thorough than products I have used in the past. It gets in room corners much better than my old unit! also, it easily goes over low-pile rugs/carpet which means more coverage with less work on my part (win!). i clean out the rollers and the dust bin before each run just to keep it running as best as possible. also, the sensor to make sure it doesn't fall off stairs works well!! my only problem is I cannot figure out how to make the remote control work. i can't even get it to turn the unit on, which is unfortunately because automatic programming is all run through the remote. But, it's not hard to bend down and hit the power button when I want it to vaccuum so it doesn't bother me all that much. still give 4 stars overall for sure!","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,4,Great alternative to the ones that are hundreds of $$ more,"We wanted to get an auto-vacuum to help maintain the never-ending mess of a cat and two small children, but we didn't want to spend Roomba prices. Found the iMartine, checked reviews and videos online and took the plunge. And we love it. It was easy to set up and start using right away. It clearly worked because we had a filter full of dirt and fur after every room. We have used it on hard floors and carpet. It feels like it works better on the hard floors in terms of the feeling of cleanliness after. We have deep carpets and while it definitely does clean up a lot of whats in there, I'm not sure the suction is quite strong enough for it. But it's a great alternative to having to vacuum all the time. Please note - it's not very quiet, and it is very attractive to kids and cats!","Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,4,It gets the job done!,"This vacuum is perfect for those who don’t have time, are always on the go, or are just straight lazy. I love that it gets underneath our bed and other furniture. It’s amazing to see how much dirt is collected after a couple hours. One negative note I noticed was that it doesn’t get to certain spots you want it to get. So I would have to manually pick it up and put it in the area I want it to clean. Now that I think about it, you can also use the remote control to guide it to where you want it to go. For the most part, it does the job eventually! As for battery life, it is limited to maybe an hour. But then again, it could be because we have a lot of dirt to clean up so it’s probably feeling overworked. I would definitely recommend this product!","Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,4,"Great purchase, worth the money","This vaccuum makes keeping my floors clean much easier, I used to sweep 3 times a day, thank goodness I have a small house! I don't feel crumbs on my feet anymore going barefoot in my house. The sensor and bumper are very gentle, it's hit my toes a couple times and it startles me but doesn't hurt. It mostly stays out of the way and gets all the little corners really well. I only wish it moved faster bc sometimes I feel I could sweep faster but it's great to leave running when you go out to run errands and come home to a clean floor. Or when you're just chilling on the couch. The battery lasts about an hour and a half, which is long enough to circle the house 5 times.

Was pleasantly surprised at how much dust & stuff it picked up! Maybe does a better job than my manual vacuum! I have a large home & ran on auto the first day. It maneuvered over a thin area rug with ease and did a very thorough job. It was pretty cool to watch as it learned the area.

The fine hair would just get everywhere and we could not brush her and sweep up enough to keep the floors clean. The vacuum picks up all of the hair from both dogs great. It causes a little bit of noise, but not enough to disturb conversations when it's in the room. The only issue we have had is that it occasionally doesn't respond to the remote control to start. We found that turning it off and turning it back on fixes it. It is short enough to reach under our TV stand where we could never get. It is very easy to maintain. We are very happy with it.","Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2020"

It is taking care of all our dog hair wonderfully and does pretty well with the floors as a whole. Our cat is fascinated with “Mayhem” as my wife has named the robot. But our dog is a bit scared of it. However, it is quiet and does everything we were hoping it would do. Just don’t watch it expecting it to hit the areas you want it to while you are watching.

It will go from vacuuming just as it does on the tile but then stops and beeps until I hit the top button and it continues to clean.

It's not too noisy, it seems to do fine in our open floor plan, and we both quickly came to love it. The random pattern does not seem to clean everything, at least not in our house. Also, it has a tendency to get trapped sometimes if it tries to enter a new room at the wrong angle or it ends up under the table it may take 10 minutes before it finds its way out at which time it promptly goes right back under.

B0D9W3B622,4,"With two cats, you need to clean filters and rotating brush regularly.","Does a pretty good job and saves your back from dragging a heavy vacuum wand around the floor. For a really good cleaning you will need to move some clutter off the floor if you expect it to get everywhere. Struggles with some throw rug fringes and tries to climb slanted table legs and some high thresholds. If you haven't vacuumed for a while, be prepared to clean the filter and brush about every 15 minutes or less until it gets everywhere on the floor. A bit more random of a pattern than expected but overall it's a great addition to your household cleaning arsenal. Been getting about 1-1/2 hours before charging on mostly carpeted floors.

Only issue is that if you don’t run it for a day or so you need to switch it off and on with the button on the bottom of the unit for it to work. If you don’t, the button on the top and the the buttons on the remote won’t work. Not a big deal but certainly not ideal. If I hadn’t thrown the box away I probably would have exchanged it for a new one. It is great to turn it on, leave and come back to a clean house.

With three dogs I use it every day. It vacuums the entire first floor on one charge. It’s slim enough to fit under most of my furniture.

The only thing, at the moment, that I don't like is, unless it's within viewing distance of the home base it can't seem to find it. Perhaps it's just me not knowing all of the features. Oh, and again it's probably just me not completely knowing how this works, after it does go home, and recharges, it starts the cleaning routine again without me starting it.

Today I decided to take out the regular vacuum to vacuum just the living room rug about the robot went through and it filled up about half way with dust.

I also have a floor plan that is somewhat open, so the vacuum can get confused about how to navigate the various side rooms.

B0D9W3B622,4,Let it do it’s thing and you’ll be glad you did.,"I have two cats that love to kick litter out of the box. I’m tired of vacuuming and/or sweeping everyday. I decided to give this a try and see how it works. I was pleasantly surprised with the results. I set the alarm for it to start cleaning at 145 pm and when I arrived home there was virtually nothing on the floors. I was so happy!!! I was skeptical at first last night because it doesn’t have a specific pattern and it kept going back to the same area it already did, but today I decided just to let it do it’s thing and thankfully it did a great job.","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,4,Updated review,"New update! May 2021 They shipped me a new machine free to replace the old one! Update-I emailed the company. They asked me to send them a video. They gave me some things to try. It did not work. They emailed me and said they would like to send me a replacement. Will update, if I get it or not. (May 1 2021.) I have had it for right at a year. It has worked great for the most part. Does get stuck sometimes. It now will only go backwards in a circle for a few seconds the shuts down.","Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2021"
B0D9W3B622,4,"Not perfect, but I like it a lot!","This little critter came well packed and with easy to understand instructions. It is surprisingly quiet. It seems to vacuum well, and can transition from different surfaces without changing direction. I found that in my house it needed adult supervision, at least part of the time. I have some nooks and crannies in my living room, and it got stuck a few times. But I really love the way it goes under the furniture and cleans those areas I’d not get to…well, ever. Or maybe when the furniture is moved. I’d recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2021"
B0D9W3B622,4,No problems with shipment or product at this point.,"We have had the unit for a few weeks now. We are happily surprised at how much dust and small particles ""Dusty"" picks up. (We had to name it.) The edge cleaning function works great. The back and forth pattern does not hold straight lines, so you have to give it time to cover the areas. Up to this point, we are pleased with the purchase. I wish this unit would have the smarts to obey the magnetic tape, even though it does not come with it. I place barriers in front of the room I do not want it to go in - no biggy.","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,4,"Good Value, Strong Suction, Not the Quietest","This iMartine was to replace our broken DEEBOT SLIM2, which lasted 2 years. The reason that we picked this was the height - the slimmest we could find. It is still higher, so this robot misses some spots (low clearence furniture) where the SLIM2 was able to get to. Compared to the SLIM2, this one has much stronger suction power, cleans faster. The noise level is not bad, but it is noticeable when it is running, while the SLIM2 sounded more or less ""nothing.""

I like that they give you an extra filter and a little hair razor. I don't like that it is tricky to put together, operate and manage,bumps into your barefeet feet pretty hard and is hard to maintain for an elderly or disabled person. The manual was not written perfectly clearly. But there is a number you can call if you need questions answered. All in all I am very happy with it!","Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,4,Nice floor cleaner,"This is my first automatic floor cleaner. It does a great job picking up hair and dirt on hardwood floors. Remote works well. It’s not very smart and works randomly bumping into everything. The floor coverage is random and would even cover same area it just cleaned. It’s doesn’t always find its way back to charger and needs help with multi room house. It randomly finds its way back to charger it seems; Not a big deal to me. It gets stick on things like shoelaces, cords, and very loose carpet.

B0D9W3B622,4,Works fine for a constant shedder.,"Use this mainly for dog hair on ceramic tile floors and it works great. One thing I’m not impressed with is the amount of fine dust that escapes. Sometimes the dog will have some fine dust from an outing in her coat that ends up on the floor. While the vacuum does pick it up, the bottom and the front edge of the vacuum will be covered in dust. Floors will be clean but the vacuum will be very dirty.","Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2021"

B0D9W3B622,4,A good value,"Purchased a Shark ION over a year ago. We struggled to keep it running but decided to try the less expensive Imartine and purchased it from Amazon. It has restored our faith in robotic vacuums. It has run well without a lot of attention, cleans well and seems far more intuitive as it works. The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is the front wheel occasionally drops out as it transitions to rugs and has to be reinstalled. Overall it has been a great investment.","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2020"

B0D9W3B622,3,Fine if you don't need a proper schedule,"This thing worked GREAT when I got it. I kept charging and running and charging and running it the first few days because it was pulling so much cat hair out of the carpet that my regular vacuum missed. After the first few days, I set the schedule and it went off and did its thing every afternoon when it was supposed to. My cats track litter everywhere, and this does a great job of cleaning up after them. It does tend to get stuck on things like my bath mat and the underside of my coffee table and cat toys (which are a struggle to get out of the wheels), so I often have to go rescue it. It will periodically stop and just beep for no apparent reason, but cleaning the hair out of the rollers or emptying the bin, or other times just pushing the power button, will get it going again. It does tend to get lost when going back to the dock, sometimes taking 30+ minutes (around which I'll go rescue it and put it on the dock myself). I've now had this thing for six months, and as of a few weeks ago, it no longer runs on schedule (and judging by the questions asked here, this isn't an uncommon problem). It doesn't even seem to have a pattern to when it runs. Today it started going at 10:20pm. Last week it frequently woke up around 4-5am. I've tried setting the clock and the scheduled run time, the vacuum beeps in response, yet still refuses to run when scheduled. I tried reaching out to the seller through Amazon, but I got an email from Amazon stating, ""there's a problem with the recipient's email system,"" and apparently the phone number doesn't work either, so I guess I'm on my own for figuring this out.","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2021"
B0D9W3B622,3,Update 9 month later.,Update: After 9 months of using it the robovac side brushes quit working properly and unit would just flash red and beep twice. Attempted mutliple resets and verified nothing jamming motors. Contacted manufacturer and they responded quickly and requested a video of the unit having the problem so I sent that to them. They confirmed the unit was having a problem and could not be fixed so they offered a refurbished unit or 41 dollars. They pro-rate the amount based on how long you've owned it during the warranty period. I chose the refurbished unit and it did arrive no problem after a couple weeks and it seems to work fine. Would give 4 or 5 stars if I knew how long the unit will last. Original review:This is a great little robovac that has options you find only on more expensive models. I have hardwood floors and this does a terrific job. Took only a few minutes to get it set up and charging up receipt. Have run it several times and have been very happy each time. I did have to raise power cords off the floor but I think that is normal for most any robovac. It will transition from hardwood to an low area rug no problem as long as it's not a thin floppy rug that does not rest on floor evenly. I have one of those floppy rugs and the machine tends to push it around sometimes vs going up and onto it.

B0D9W3B622,3,Don’t expect it to replace a full sized vacuum,"I bought iMartine robo vacuum in 2020 and it did well for surface lint, dust and hair. The hair actually gets tangled in the brushes so it’s a pain cutting & cleaning the hair out. I have a low pile faux oriental rug and this vacuum does an awful job trying to go over it. It seems to go against the grain of the carpet and bounces around, accomplishing nothing. I haven’t used it in about six months. It stayed charged on it’s charging dock. Just went to use it and it’s making a grinding noise, which it never did before. Also, the dirt cup is very small. All in all I wouldn’t invest in a robo vacuum again.

B0D9W3B622,3,I returned it.,"Hear me out on this one. PROs: - Reasonable price - Remote control easy to use - lightweight, easy to clean CONs: - Mine in particular, would run into objects. It seemed the sensors weren’t working right. - Not as great for pet hair as it claims (however, I have two German shepherds with long hair, so I can’t totally blame a small vacuum) - Only works well when you’re using the remote. Hands free option and letting it do its thing did not give good results. I found it staying in one area of a room and rarely made it throughout the house. I figure the lack of mapping technology contributes to this. - Suction was not that great - even on Max - It would only find its way “home” about half the time. It would occasionally get close to the dock and then turn around and go a different way lol.","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,3,Worked great for two weeks.,"Worked great for 2 weeks, now the 2 beeps side brush alarm keeps going off. I clean it twice through every run, and even replaced the side brushes, which were fine, by the way. Tried to find troubleshooting videos or manuals, to no avail. Incredibly irritated and disappointed. Update: amazon is replacing. Will change review as needed, once time tells how well the replacement does. Update: It tries. It does. It wants to be a good vacuum. It just doesn't have the power. Also has gotten louder. I have two large, shedding dogs, though. If you have a non pet household, or even just one creature that doesn't shed small fur puppies, this vacuum would be a fine addition to the household. TLDR: Decent, but not built for multiple pets.","Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2020"

It gets stuck on boarders not all the time but when it does it just stays there until i give it some help. Not good for leaving on when u go out .

B0D9W3B622,3,it misses much - does not go in straight lines and does not remember where it had previously been.,On the one hand it does pick up a lot of dust and dirt but it also misses a lot since it does not go in straight lines and does not remember where it had previously been. so it runs in arcs rather then a serpentine pattern as is indicated on the remote control button. nevertheless we still use it. Also you need to clean all the inside corners and along walls and around any objects on the floor since it does not get the dust and dirt close to walls and objects.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2022"

B0D9W3B622,3,Won't be durable as your your hold vacuum that is still chugging along.,"So here we are in July. IT does an amazing job picking up cat hair and debris. My mom doesn't get teary eyes from the floating hair or smell. Very easy to clean. Goes on your average carpet, wouldn't recommend anything over 1 inch. - Where i think it went wrong. I would run this vacuum three times a day, each time it would pick up cat hair and debris filling tray. Cats are tabby so the hair isn't too long. I would clean filter and rollers once every two weeks. * The result of so much use was the vacuum started getting loud. Then very loud on flat surfaces. *** Contacted support *** They informed me to remove the rolling brush and run the unit. It was less noisy but still meh. So they offered replacement unit or refund. I decided to take a refund and get the same model or one that is same price with more features. - The refund was prorated by how many months i used it, their response ( The Refund we will provide to you: 178.70 - [ ( 178.70 / 12) x 6 ] = 89.35 $). I've never heard of any appliance manufacturer doing this sort thing when its 100% manufacturer issue and still within warranty period. The same unit would be nice but even running it less like once a day would get me about a year out of the robot before the roller brush motors give out. Pros - Amazing for cleaning pet hair and everyday vacuuming. I used human vacuum once every three weeks cause it does such nice job. - Necessary for anyone with time constraints. Moms at home with kiddos, professionals, students. I'd say its a must have. - Warranty customer service is through email and once a day responses as they are based in China. Cons - Don't expect more than a year out of this vacuum if you use daily and have pets. - Eats your cords - Attacks your toes (pro - if you are in to that sort of thing) - Expensive for a maybe a year of service and the prorated refund is lame. TIPS!!! If you can purchase a vacuum from a dependable no hassle 100% satisfaction (full refund) go with them. The roller motors are about $60+ if you want to replace yourself. So this sort of robot will be in goodwill or junk yard very soon. DO NOT BUY USED any Robot Vacuum!","Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2020"

B0D9W3B622,2,Not worth it,"I've had many of this type of robat vac, and this one is not so impressive. Granted, it's cheap, but it simply doesn't deliver. Most of the info below is in comparison to a low-end Neato (not Neato's top model). First, the good... Low profile fits under most furniture. Battery life is fine for an average size home (1500-2000sf). The bad... Although it does fit under most furniture, it apparently has no ability to see when it's a tight fit and regularly gets stuck under certain pieces of furniture in my house. It literally goes half way under, gets stuck, and simply stops. It beeps for a short while but stops warning the user much quicker than other brands. The sensors that 'look' at it's path appear to provide *no coverage of anything that's not actually on the floor, even if it's 2 or 3"" off the floor. This vacuum is quite clearly less intelligent than other brands. It gets stuck easily in corners, for instance. I have seen so many times where it will go into a corner near one of my couches. There is a fan that stands there, but there's a path a foot or so wide that it can sneak through, but then when it's in this 3x3' area, it cannot find it's way out, past the fan. It will spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to get out, and will eventually either die there or just give up, beep a while, then shut down. The same thing happens with objects that are not ""blunt"". For example, if you have a large box, or other object that appears to this vacuum as a ""wall"", then it will bump into it a few times and give up. However, if the obstacle appears as a ""ramp"" to this vacuum (imagine curved feet on something with legs), it will try and try and try to drive up the ramps. It's literally as if it simply doesn't even see them. As I type this, I'm realizing other brands seem to have visual sensors that this doesn't appear to have, or have as many, or it's simply not smart enough to handle what it's seeing. At the end of it's efforts, I still have to manually clean nearly every corner is my house. One last thing about this unit. Quite often, the unit doesn't start when it's supposed to, so I have to pick it up and flip it upside down, turn it off, wait a few seconds, then turn it back on. Then it will work as usual, which as you have read above, it's all that impressive. As far as leaving this thing to do it's job on it's own, forget about it. It's basically a vacuum that leaves dirty corners, gets stuck over half the time it's used, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,2,Downgraded review - started out pretty good but it is now landfill,"*****Update 9/6/22***** Just threw this in the trash. First, they had to send me another battery. Then the front brushes keep stopping and when the front brushes stop turning, the unit shuts itself off. This would happen occasionally, like once a week or so. And you have fiddle with it, turning it off and on and off and on and spinning the brushes manually until they start turning again and the vacuum would run. Sometimes it would stop again a few minutes later and sometimes they would run properly for days. But now they just no longer turn, no matter what I do. Also, this unit stopped picking up anything other than dust. Little bits would remain on the ground even after this unit swept over it several times. With the continual breakdowns and the complete decline in cleaning power, it just isn't worth the money. And now that it is broken down completely. My first robot vacuum lasted several years. This one just didn't hold up. *****Update 5/19/21***** So the company shipped me a new battery. I replaced it and it is now back to running about 2 hours. Hopefully this battery will last longer than 6 or so months. *****Original***** I purchased this vacuum about 7 months ago. I have owned several robot vacs and this is one of the better ones in this price range. The low profile prevents it from getting stuck under my cabinets or refrigerator, which happened often with my previous vacs. And it does a good job of cleaning. But here's why it gets a low star rating. Like I said, I have had the vacuum only 7 months. At first, this vacuum ran over 2 hours so it did a very thorough job of cleaning. But it has slowly shortened to the point where it only runs 30-45 minutes. So now my floors are still dirty even after it runs. My previous vac's battery lasted a couple years before it died. But 7 months and I have to replace the battery? I have reached out to the company and will update my review based on what they say/do.","Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2021"
B0D9W3B622,2,"Low vacuum power, Faulty stairway protection","I got my new Robovac (an IMartine Model IM2019) two weeks ago.On the first attempt to use it, it did a marvelous job of vacuuming my bedroom, which had accumulated a lot of dog hairs. On the second day, it cleaned another bedroom, but did not vacuum up a lot of particles on the rug that were moved by the ""whiskers"". On the third attempt, there were a lot of instances of particles that were moved but not vacuumed. On the last day, it was attempting to vacuum all the rooms on the second floor. I was not paying a lot of attention as it performed these duties. At some point, I noticed that it had become very quiet in the house. I went to find the IMartine, and it was down at the bottom on the stairs, upside down, and not running. Despite its design features that supposedly prevented it from falling down stairs, it had managed to take a high dive off the edge. Now I will be throwing away a fairly large investment with little to show for it. I owe the manufacturer a follow up. When I picked the vacuum up from the bottom of the stairs, the dust bin was jammed shut. After some prying with a couple of screwdrivers, I got it opened and there was lots of trash inside. The main brush was full of dog hairs. I emptied both and placed the unit on the charging dock. The light came on solid pink. The next day the light had changed to blue. I attempted to start the unit at that point and got nothing. That's when I wrote the earlier review. Today I rescued the unit from the trash and gave it another try. NO luck. However, I turned the unit over and rocked the power switch. To my surprise, the unit came back to life, and proceeded to clean the family room without further trouble.

B0D9W3B622,2,"Gets stuck too often, poor routing and cleans small area","This product is a chinese knock-off of a chinese product (Eufy). And I am not entirely happy with it. I have had it for half a year. Before it, had Eufy, but Eufy broke - twice. Good: Works, did not break yet. Cleans the hair well, and picks up small pieces of rubbish (like cat's food pellets) also well. Not overly loud. Bad: - suction is not sufficient. The advertised 1600 number requires a ""max"" setting which reduces battery life quite a bit. Needs to run over same place 3 - 4 times to really clean it. - intelligence of selecting a route is zero to none. Has a rectangle pattern ingrained, with a border follow-up if the rectangle fails. Prone to get stuck in between few distant objects if they are just positioned in the way it cannot deal with well. As a result, in the same time as Eufy, it cleans smaller area. - It is prone to be stuck under things much more frequently than Eufy because it does not understand it is stuck and tries forward until it is hopeless. - The brushes much more prone to tangling and being messed up.

B0D9W3B622,2,Unpleasantly surprised,"I chose this vacuum cleaner as my mother's day gift this year after the many good reviews I had read. I've had a robotic vacuum cleaner before that was amazing just a much older model so I figured I'd treat myself and upgrade. However, this vacuum is more of a pain than a help. It is constantly getting stuck on EVERYTHING and will just randomly stop in the middle of the room for no reason during it's pre-scheduled cycle. Everything trips it up and the spinning brushes are so constantly getting entangled on everything, I had to replace them both the very first week I had the thing. I have two large german sheperds and two kids so something that helps keep the dog hair off the floor is a godsend but unfortunately, it is not this machine.

B0D9W3B622,2,Worked for a little while,"I bought this product based on the reviews, but I regret that decision now. It worked okay for the first two months.

Now it runs in a random pattern and never fully cleans the floors. I have taken out the battery to try to reset it. I have used all the settings on the remote. I have done everything. My house is basically a square shape with a section in the middle. It never goes all around the square. I have to physically pick it up to place it in a different room. It will run for an hour and never fully clean the floors. At this stage of the game, I guess it's just keeping me from having to vacuum quite as much, but I still have to vacuum behind it each time.

Even when our floor is spotless it will still find some way to trap itself. I don’t believe the sensors are smart at all since it just bangs around on all of my furniture. I feel like it was a huge waste of money, and I wished I had saved up just a bit more and got a name brand vacuum. I had high hopes, but it doesn’t vacuum well, and it’s not smart enough to run independently.","Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,2,"Lasted a year, and then went downhill","Worked well for about a year and then it refused to charge properly. It would charge normally for a few minutes, but then the button would light up red and start blinking. We looked through the manual, and did everything listed to fix the problem. Nothing worked. It would still charge, but every time we put it on the charger it would just light up red and beep. By itself this was tolerable, but then it started making a terrible noise whenever it cleans, and the noise has been getting progressively worse. Again, we have tried everything suggested in the manual, and cleaned every part of this machine. Nothing helps. Definitely would not buy again. Leaving 2 stars because it did work well for a while.","Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2021"
B0D9W3B622,2,DOES NOT WORK ON CARPET,"I have had my iMartine vacuum for about 6 months. It works fine on my hardwood floors, but has not worked on my carpet well at all, and continues to worsen. It alarms every 4-12 seconds when running on a medium-pile carpet, despite all the troubleshooting I can figure out. I have to hold the remote and click to pause and restart, each time it alarms, which makes it so annoying and beepy. It's not something that you can set in a room and leave. I have to babysit it the entire time its running. The spinning brushes at the front also recently topped spinning. It doesn't appear to be jammed with hair or dirt and I can't figure out why it isn't spinning. I wish I hadn't purchased this. I should have just gotten a regular vacuum that I can push. It would be so much faster and easier.","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2020"

Constantly getting stuck in places and literally forces itself under our couches and on our area rug to the point that it stops working and we have to find it and put it back on the hardwood floor to get it going again...it's a surprise when we actually find that it's made it to it's docking station without us having to put it there (has trouble docking when the station is in an open area with NO obstacles) Save the money and put it towards a higher quality vacuum.

But after 2 months of use almost daily, the suction wasn't so great anymore. What made me finally return it was that the trash can got stuck and nothing could make it open and be emptied. I called amazon, they tried to reach customer service for troubleshooting...the customer service number Amazon has for them doesn't work!

The annoying thing was having to deep clean it basically after every use if you have pets or hair. The hair gets caught around the spinning wheel and you have to untangle it with the little tool they give you. There were some issues here and there but overall we liked it, however it stopped working completely and kept saying the side brush was stuck even though we replaced the side brush, cleaned off the sensors etc. This issue had happened several times but this time it didn’t resolve and now it feels like we wasted so much money.","Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2020"

I had to restart it probably 10 times in the 40 minutes I had it running, and not once was it a justified reset. It’s clear this thing would get nothing accomplished if I wasn’t here to keep it going. It has good suction, and gets under all my furniture.

As a university professor, my workload increased dramatically during the last year, and this allowed me to clean my house while I worked. Even with 3 cats and 3 dogs that shed all over the house, this vacuum did an outstanding job of cleaning up the hair. I think it left my hardwood floors looking the best they've ever looked since I lived in this house (it's it possible the brushes polish the floor?!). Sadly, just 8 months after the purchase, I'm having issues with the brushes turning and even after replacing them twice, still end up with the vacuuming being interupted by the two beep warning telling me that the brushes are no longer turning. Sometimes I can get it going again by turning it off and on a couple of times and spinning the brushes myself a few rotations. Sometimes not, and I end up pulling out the Dyson to vacuum myself.

B0D9W3B622,2,Easy to Clean and Use UPDATE: Battery life terrible,"UPDATE: Not yet 3 years later, the battery life is AWFUL. On a full charge it can barely pass over one room. Reducing my rating since it sucks to spend so much money on something that becomes useless so soon. I live with a dog that sheds like no other.. I brush this dog every other day and he still leaves tufts of fur every time I pet him. Our home fills up with fur pretty fast and cleaning so often was driving me crazy so I bought this robot vacuum. My life has been CHANGED. Having a robot vacuum is a real time saver and I let it clean the house every other day, but with supervision for the reasons I'll list. This robot isn't perfect but it's good enough so that I enjoy having it and don't regret my purchase. Not sure if it's the best robot vacuum on the market for certain households so hopefully my review can help. What works great: -It doesn't fall off stairs! I watched it run for the first time to make sure it was safe to let it run while I was gone. I was scared I was going to watch my $150 go down the drain because of robot death by stairs. However, the drop sensors work really well and it has never fallen down stairs. -Remote is easy to use. It gives you a lot of control over the robot and it's fun to move it around. -Can go on carpet and wood floors -Easy to empty and clean the filter -Works on short hair dog fur -Has a long battery life and can pass over the living room and kitchen several times. What does not work well: -Aggressively flips thinner rugs. We have a good amount of rugs in the home and some of them the vacuum will flip over. It won't get stuck but it'll toss the rugs around. -Aggressively bumps into everything. Sometimes it seems like it can sense the wall but sometimes it just rams into everything. I haven't had any of my wooden chairs damaged from the vacuum yet. -Does not work very well with long hair. While the dog has short hair, the humans have long hair. It will create tangles and clumps of long hair under the two front spinning brushes and twice within the past week one of the brushes will fall off because of the tangle. Once it creates the tangle it can't pick it up, but it's easy to pick up the clump of hair yourself. It is annoying to rip the hair off of the spinning brushes. -It takes a few passes over the floor to get everything clean. Because of the rug issue and sometimes getting stuck on objects I let the robot run under supervision only. It's still great to have since I can clean the stairs or something else as the robot runs and it speeds up cleaning.","Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2020"

She (Rosie) went haywire (started going in reverse) in less than a year but while she was working my floors were spic and span. I decided to try something a little more expensive WITHOUT the mop feature hoping to gain some longevity. So I purchased this one with a beater bar (Marti). SO Rosie and MArti clean like a woman and a man. Rosie ...Spic and span but totally went bazerk after 7 months and now needs therapy. Marti has a well thought out clean out ..... SOOOO much nicer. That is where the good ends. Why Marti comes with a beater bar I will never know.. It does nothing but pick things up and deposit them on my 2 throw rugs (I have bare floors). NOT ONCE have I emptied dog hair from the hopper! Marti just wraps it all around himself and then beeps angrily at me for ""Maintenance"" I have run this vac for 2 weeks and had to ""service him"" 4 times. I swear it is like we are dating! Rosie picked up EVERYTHING and never complained. Marti runs around the house and SQUEAKS CONSTANTLY as if he is saying ..""look at me I am cleaning"". Rosie was so simple. Hit go and she would take off. Marti I have to ""warm him up"" on the remote and dang near get on my knees and touch the remote to Marti to get him to go. every 3 days I have to shave the hair off his beater bar and wiggle his drive wheel. (I cannot get it removed so I have to wiggle it until some debris comes out. Marti's receptacle NEVER has any hair in it...only dirt. Rosie picked up dirt and hair and rocks.

Do you have furniture in your home? if so, don't buy it. Do you have rugs or bath mats? If so, don't buy it. DO you expect dirt or fur to be picked up? if so, don't buy it. This vacuum has actually turned into a running joke at my house because if the vacuum is turned on myself or my daughter have to ""babysit"" this thing because it is inevitable that it is going to get stuck on any and every piece of furniture, and it will avoid any messes at all cost. At this point, the vacuum stays on the charger and I just sweep daily because the constant getting stuck on furniture and beeping is enough to drive a person insane. The sensors as advertises, are none existent, it runs into any and everything, humans, pets, walls, furniture. The one good thing I have to say is that the battery charge last at least 2 hours, which would be an awesome feature, if only it actually did its job, but at this point all I hear is 2 hours of beeps, so this is a very fancy appliance that has grown to collect dust.

However, within just a few months, it had already fallen down my stairs 8 times and the side brushes quit working all together. This caused the vacuum to quit altogether. This is in spite of me following all of the manufacturers cleaning and maintenance instructions that came with the vacuum. My vacuum worked for 3 months. This vacuum has a manufacture's warranty for 1 year. I contacted Amazon after the vacuum quit working and they provided a link to the manufacturer to file my concerns.

I replied with the requested information and then all went silent. I emailed them a again 1 week after submitting their required information.

B0D9W3B622,1,Just kicks the dirt and hair around.,"I'm a busy guy so anything to save time is incredibly exciting. Unfortunately, this was more of a time-kill than a time saver. It worked great the first couple of weeks, and cleaning and emptying the storage is a fairly straight forward process but the negatives far outweigh the positives. Ultimately, I will be returning. - It's really good with hair. Litter, sprinkles, little pieces of dirt it doesn't suction at all even right after the machine has been cleaned. It takes spilled cat litter and spurts it around spreading it all over the room and ironically creates a bigger mess. - It moves with really no rhyme or reason. It moves aimlessly and after a whole hour still misses entire chunks of the floor. It's incredibly frustrating to watch. - Will need to cover the same spot 2 or 3 times to get a good clean. - It gets stuck at least once per cleaning use despite my furniture being lined up against the walls. - It's a lot noisier than I thought it was going to be. I'm fortunate to live in a house. In an apartment with non-carpeted floors, there are high chances that it would be too noisy. - Overall it's less frustrating and more time-saving to use a regular vacuum and just do it yourself.","Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2020"

It goes off at exactly 2:11pm. I work from home now and almost always have meetings during that time. The vacuum is loud as shit and is like a cat who constantly wants into only the room I am in. We've reset it multiple times to fix the time, doesn't work. Sometimes it even goes off in the middle of the night at 1, 2, 3am for NO. REASON. Then gets stuck on air and screams for 2 minutes. I'm ready to take it to a rage room and destroy it with a bat.","Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2021"
B0D9W3B622,1,Gets stuck frequently - Disappointing!!!,"It has been almost four months since I bought this robo vac. I've used it 8 or 9 times in that timeframe. It worked like it was supposed to initially, redirecting itself whenever it bumped into a piece of furniture and returning to its docking station when its battery got low. But then it started stopping and beeping at me every one or two minutes. It would stop and beep in the middle of the floor, so it wasn't even doing it when it got stuck under a piece of furniture. I then had to re-start it manually. It would then work for another minute or two before stopping and beeping again. This meant I had to be in the same room with it in order to restart it each time. Also, it stopped returning to its docking base on its own. It would just run out of power in the middle of the floor, and I had to return it manually. It's pretty useless if I have to supervise it this carefully. It's much faster and more efficient just to clean your floor with a regular vacuum cleaner. I finally threw out my iMartine. This was my first robot vac and it will be my last. What a disappointing experience!!","Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,1,Stopped working after 2 months,"I bought an iLife years ago and loved it but it finally dies on me and I bought this. It keeps stopping and beeping and I don’t know why. I keep emptying it and cleaning it and it won’t stop. I think it’s defective and I want my money back. I will be contacting customer service if I can reach them. The iLife was way better. I was really hoping this would work great for me and it’s been a dud. I’ve had it for about 2 months. At first it cleaned very well and went to port when battery was low and did a fantastic job. The only thing I don’t like about this machine is that if you have a dog that sheds, the roller is constantly riddled with dog hair and you have to clean it out often. The iLife just sucked it up and you could empty it. The roller is made for carpet and I only have tile so I guess I really dont need the roller. UPDATE: They refunded me and I sent it back! Great customer service!!","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2019"
B0D9W3B622,1,A disposable vacuum,"I bought this in August 2020 and it worked great for about ten months. After that, it began to rattle and make an intolerable loud noise while operating. I contacted seller and they suggested I clean it thoroughly, which I had been. I oiled the side of the beater brush so that it would spin smoothly, but that only temporarily fixed the horrible, loud noise. The battery began to lose power after ten months of use too. It would run for twenty minutes, then need to go back to the dock to recharge. Now, 14 months later, it is totally dead. I wouldn't recommend this vacuum unless you are vacuuming maybe 500 square feet, or less, maybe once per week or even less, if you want it to last. Not recommended for bigger spaces, or a home with pets. Save your money and the environment and invest in a quality brand, like a Roomba. The NY Times has a good review article of better quality robot vacs.","Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,1,iMartine not working,"I ordered this item in December 2020 and used it to clean my house which is fully tiled. After using it about five times the dust pan is stuck and one wheel is not moving. Luckily I kept my ""old"" upright vacuum which is about 11 years old and still working beautifully. I tried to call IMartine, but no one ever answers. I send a message to the website and they send a video with instructions. I also called Amazon but they said it is now six months so they cannot help and that I should call IMartine. Unfortunately, this seems to be the end of this vacuum. I am now 70 years old and really looked forward to the ease of having the house cleaned without any stress of having to bend down to move it around or to move wires. I am extremely dissapointed at the response to this distressing situation. No more IMARTINE for me","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2021"
B0D9W3B622,1,Works great... for a few months.,"I really liked this robot vac for about 6 months. I loved that it vacuums and picks up a bunch of hair and dirt, we have 3 dogs and 2 cats. so we have a lot of hair in this house. After 6 months, it started making this awful LOUD sound when vacuuming. It is still picking up great, but that noise is intolerable. I reached out to iMartine and they have not responded, through email OR phone. Their support phone number goes to a VM box that is FULL and wont take any messages. DO NOT buy from this company unless you enjoy throwing your money away! I don't have much hope at this point but I would like a replacement. Also my remote works but the timer on it has NEVER worked. and yes the time is right and the set time is right, it just never turns on.","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,1,Crappy Vacuum. Don’t buy.,"If I could give 0 stars I 100% would. This vacuum worked once and hasn’t worked since. It will either flash red and make beeping noises or a solid red light will appear. I’ve read the manual and followed all the “error instructions” and still nothing. Sensors have been looked at, it’s been charged, and I even swapped the brushes to the replacement ones that came in the box and still no luck. Received it late September and didn’t bother opening the box because we were moving to a new home soon. After moving in last week I was excited to try the vacuum and it worked well for one go round. Since then it won’t even leave its home dock. Terrible quality. I strongly recommend just spending the extra money on a Shark or iRobot brand.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,1,The Robot iMartine vacuum cleaner didn't last more than 2 times!,"I bought this vacuum from a review by a friend. I had to try several places to put it to work. The first time I used it I had to fold up any rug that had a braided end on it, which I understood. It became caught in certain areas where I had to redirect it, so I was glad I did not leave it to run on its own. However, when I tried to use it a 2nd time it refused to work. it would not come off the charging pad, no matter what I did. I read all directions and troubleshooting, but never was able to get it to work again. I would not recommend or buy this!","Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2021"
B0D9W3B622,1,Disappointing purchase,"This machine has been inconsistent in its performance. It doesn't clean corners or edges. I needed to replace the lithium ion battery in less than six months and in nine months it quit working. I contacted the company and after sending a video, required, I was told a new machine would be shipped. It has not arrived within two weeks and my emails inquiring about the expected timeline and method of shipping are being ignored. My best advice is to ignore this brand and purchase from a company with a well-known name and track record. Avoid doing business with these people.","Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2021"
B0D9W3B622,1,Very Frustrating Robovac,This robovac wouldn't keep running. Most of the time it stopped with 4 beeps and a red indicator which indicated the main brush couldn't turn. I would clean it out and it would soon stop again. When it did keep running it kept bumping into everything and would become trapped all the time. I never got it to run long enough to clean the whole floor. It would start up with the set time but it would stop working in a few minutes. I tried to guide it with the remote but as soon as it bumped into a leg it would stop. Very frustrating! I returned it after 3 days of trying to get it to work for me.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2019"
B0D9W3B622,1,Not Built to Last,"Not build to last. I bought this in May of this year and its already practically useless. It does not have bluetooth or wifi capabilities, you can not program it to clean certain areas or rooms, so you have to sit there and babysit the thing so it doesn't chew up the Christmas tree skirt or run over the cat food plate. It gets stuck in corners and does not clean throughly at all. Sometimes it says its fully charged but it won't respond to the remote unless I flip it over and hit the power button a couple times, then when it comes on it says it's not fully charged. I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money on this cheap vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,1,Look elsewhere,"If you want to buy a vacuum that will push the hair or dirt from one side of the room to the other, this is the one for you! The suction is terrible, the garbage tray is tiny, and overall just does a terrible job at cleaning. Look somewhere else. The 2 pros are that the battery does last a while so if you have a big floor plan and you want your dirt moved from one end of the house to the other, this vacuum will do it. The other pro is that the sensors are pretty good, it hasn’t banged up or broken anything.","Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2021"

It was such a pain to use I rarely used it. I had to pick it up and put it in the next room to get it to move on. During those two months I probably used it about 5 times.

We’ve had it for a month now, and so far the brush arms keep falling off (which should be replaced every few months as opposed to falling off after a few weeks). The vacuum also gets stuck often. The timing feature has disfunctioned several times too (we set the timer for it vacuum at 9am, but it randomly comes on late at night). Overall very underwhelming.

But, something inside has gone wrong. The whirly brush got stuck in the ""on"" position even when the rest of the machine was stuck, tired or trying to turn off. Now it's just stuck completely, even though there's no debris or anything hindering it, which renders the whole machine inoperable.

Has not once made it back to its “home” on the docking station and I have to search for where it became entrapped-under the kitchen table, couches, the hallway half bath. Noise is fairly significant (annoying while working in the office).

B0D9W3B622,5,Bye Bye pet hair,"This thing is wonderful . First impressions matter, and this robot vacuum does not disappoint with its sleek, modern design. It fits seamlessly into any home decor and easily navigates different floor types, from hardwood to tile. The build quality feels solid and durable, which is reassuring in a device that needs to withstand regular usage. This Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo has exceeded my expectations. It successfully merges the functionalities of vacuuming and mopping, effectively making my cleaning routine more convenient and efficient. While it may not replace the need for occasional deep cleaning, it certainly maintains a high standard of daily cleanliness with minimal effort on my part.","Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2024"
B0D9W3B622,5,Great affordable & efficient vacuum,"This is the second robot vacuum I have purchased. The combination of the two is amazing and makes my life so much easier. The vacuum gets up all of my pet's hair as well as the crumbs my kids leave around. Just be sure to pick up anything that the unit can get stuck on. I have a fairly worn rug by my door that I've noticed the unit will get stuck on from time to time. I love that I can set up a schedule for this robot from the app or use the remote. This unit is quite and smooth. I'd say mighty but fierce. The mop feature is great. I was worried it would just dump water on the floor and just push it around, but it actually gets the job done without leaving anything behind. The only negative thus far is that sometimes it can get a little lost in a room when you send it ""home"". It just takes a little longer to find its way back. I highly recommend this little guy! We will be purchasing another one for our second floor.","Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2024"
B0D9W3B622,5,Great product!,"I've been using the Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo for a few days now, and overall, I'm quite impressed. Here's my take on it: Performance: This little gadget packs quite a punch with its 1400Pa suction. It handles pet hair and dust on my hardwood floors effortlessly. It even does a decent job on my low pile carpet, though I wouldn't rely on it for deep cleaning. The mopping function is a nice bonus. It’s not going to replace a thorough mop, but it's great for quick cleanups and keeping the floors looking tidy. Ease of Use: The app integration is a game-changer. I can start, stop, and schedule cleanings from my phone, which is super convenient. It’s also compatible with WiFi, so I can control it even when I’m not home. The robot returns to its charging station on its own, which is one less thing to worry about. Design: It's slim enough to get under most of my furniture, and it's relatively quiet, so it doesn't disturb the household. The dustbin and water tank are easy to remove and clean, which I appreciate. Limitations: It’s not perfect, though. Sometimes it struggles with navigation, especially in rooms with a lot of obstacles. I’ve had to rescue it a few times when it got stuck. The mopping function could be a bit more powerful, but it’s decent for light cleaning. Final Thoughts: For the price, this Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo is a solid investment for maintaining clean floors with minimal effort. It’s especially useful if you have pets or a busy schedule. Just keep in mind it’s best for maintenance rather than deep cleaning.","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024"
B0D9W3B622,5,Enjoy your clean home!,"I recently purchased the Robot vaccum and mop combo, and it has truly transformed my home cleaning experience. This robotic vacuum and mop is an absolute game-changer, deserving every bit of its five-star rating. Firstly, the vacuum's design is sleek and modern, fitting seamlessly into my home's aesthetic. But more importantly, it's incredibly effective. The robot vacuum and mop boasts powerful suction that picks up even the most stubborn dirt and debris from both carpets and hard floors. I have a mix of flooring in my home, including thick rugs and hardwood, and this little machine handles all surfaces with ease. One of the standout features is its intelligent mapping and navigation system. The robot vacuum and mop uses advanced sensors and a sophisticated algorithm to map out my home and plan the most efficient cleaning route. This means no more random, haphazard movements or missed spots. It even remembers the layout of my house for future cleanings, making each session faster and more efficient. The mopping function is equally impressive. The robot vacuum and mop has a dedicated water tank and a mop attachment that can be easily installed. It uses a controlled water release system to ensure that the floor gets just the right amount of moisture, avoiding any water damage. My floors have never looked cleaner or shinier. I especially appreciate that it can tackle sticky spots and stains with its dual scrubber action. Another feature I love is the programmable cleaning schedule. With the companion app, I can set up a cleaning routine that fits my lifestyle. Whether I want a quick clean every morning or a deep clean on weekends, the robot vacuum and mop handles it all autonomously. The app also sends me notifications about the vacuum's status, including when the dustbin needs emptying or if it encounters an obstacle. Speaking of obstacles, the robot vacuum and mop is excellent at navigating around furniture and avoiding falls down stairs. The anti-collision and anti-drop sensors work flawlessly, providing peace of mind, especially when I run it while I'm not at home. The battery life is another major plus. On a full charge, it runs for about 150 minutes, which is more than enough to clean my entire house in one go. When the battery runs low, it automatically returns to its charging dock, so it's always ready for the next cleaning session. In conclusion, the robotic vacuum and mop is a stellar robotic vacuum and mop that has exceeded my expectations in every way. It's powerful, intelligent, and incredibly convenient, making my life so much easier. If you're looking for a top-notch cleaning solution that delivers outstanding performance, look no further than the robot vacuum and mop. It's worth every penny and then some!","Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2024"

The only issues I have had is we have 2 chihuahuas. They absolutely bark nonstop at the robot. The biggest drawback for us is that our furniture is about 1/8 of an inch too short and the robot gets caught under it. Simple fix though....

Only issues we’ve had have been it going under beds and getting stuck on stuff underneath (so now we shut bedroom doors when it’s running and vacuum that area separately), and getting hung up under a set of nesting tables that have metal bars that run along the floor. This robot runs about an hour and a half to 2 hours at a time. We’ve had it about two months now, and it has stunned us with what a great job it does! It does such a great job, I know four other folks now with this same robot vacuum (kept referring it), and we all love it!","Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2021"

B0D9W3B622,5,Stopped working after a year or so,"Worked great for a while but it wouldn’t turn on automatically. I always had to turn it on, but that was ok cause I would empty the bin first. It was frustrating cause he would eat stuck in places or would continue to clean on my bar benches for a good while like he was being stubborn about cleaning the bottom of it when it’s like “it’s already clean now continue to another area”. Anyway, it would do the job until recently where he just stopped working. I turn him in and he was about to start and then he just turns in circles and turns off so it has to be his wheel but I can’t fix that. I’ve looked and there’s nothing stuck so now I can’t use him.

B0D9W3B622,4,"First vacuum robot, expected a bit more","Let me start by saying that whenever I use this machine, I stare at it in AWE. I am so fascinated by the concept of a tiny device vacuuming my entire apartment without me needing to do it manually. AND it knows how to go back ""home"" ??? Insane. Though it is annoying how I need to ensure I have no shoe laces or charging cables touching the ground or it's game over. That being said, though the suction is powerful enough, it leaves you wanting a little more. There are certain things I've noticed it won't pick up. And my only other problem, really, is that it doesn't get things too much in a corner. For instance, I have food crumbs in the corner of the floor under my kitchen cupboards/cabinets, and this vacuum doesn't reach it for some reason, which is when I'm forced to use a proper vacuum cleaner. Which is not as enjoyable. But overall, I am thoroughly impressed with this machine. It has made it so effortless to vacuum my apartment on a regular basis.","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2021"
B0D9W3B622,4,Very happy,I am very happy with my IMartine. As you can see it had great suction. I had cleaned the same floors with my canister vacuum that has good suction the day before it came. This was my second used of the IMartine and I thought I need to get a photo. I do have a cat that looses a lot of hair even with frequent brushing. I picked this model because it said it does well with medium pile carpet. It goes very easily from my tiled kitchen to my medium pile carpet. I use to have a Rumba that I loved too but I bought it when they first came out years ago. This one actually does a much better job. I’m sure technology has improved. I only gave it a four because the battery life only lasted 45 minutes and it said 120 minutes. If it wasn’t for that it would be a 5+.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2021"

The lack of mapping technology shows here. - It gets stuck on the oddest things, but instead of alerting that it's stuck or gliding over the obstacle (in this case a fan base) it just keeps obsessively cleaning the one area.","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2021"

B0D9W3B622,4,Good product with good price,"I like this vacuum cleaner. It's very good quality and very good price compared to the Rumba. I like the remote control and the different options it gives you. It's relatively quiet and it does a good job picking up dirt and hair. It transitions very well from hard floor to carpet but gets stuck on some rugs. The good think is that if it gets stuck, it turns itself off. I do have to clean the brushes often since the long hair gets wrapped around them, but they are very easy to clean. The battery lasts about 45 minutes, I would've like it to last a little longer, and it does take a few hours to recharge. When the battery is low, if the vacuum is far away from the charger, it takes it a while to find the charger. I guess it doesn't get the signal unless it is about 4-5 feet away from it.

It does pick up a lot but, the bin and the brush get loaded up. I run this at night and, I have to move the couch and chairs against the wall or it gets stuck underneath them. It got stuck a few times until I started doing that. I also vacuum with a Dyson cordless every day. I also brush the dog daily with a shedding brush and, I still have an abundance of hair around. This vacuum helps but, it can't do it by itself. I clean it out every morning and, I've attached photos of the condition it's in. I need to mention that this thing has a mind of its own too. I set the time on the remote and programmed it to start vacuuming at 2:00 AM but, it would start at 9:56 PM. I have to stop it and manually start it when I go to bed. After changing the time to daylight savings time, it starts at 8:56 PM now. I've tried changing the time I want it to start and even the actual time but, it still starts at the same time.

The only thing, at the moment, that I don't like is, unless it's within viewing distance of the home base it can't seem to find it. Perhaps it's just me not knowing all of the features. Oh, and again it's probably just me not completely knowing how this works, after it does go home, and recharges, it starts the cleaning routine again without me starting it.

B0D9W3B622,4,Like it better than roomba now,"So I was initially excited. Now after using for a bit I have to say completely unimpressed. I just had it do one room. All hardwood floors and it’s not a large room at all. It ran for 1/2 hour and it was annoying but it happens. I went to lay down the rug and had to sweep the floor. The dust bin in the machine was not hardly full. I don’t know if a Roomba or shark work better but I won’t be finding out. Also can’t get the schedule thing to work. Followed directions and it starts at midnight every night. I have to turn off the power. Not worth it. Update: got a roomba and can’t say I love it. Roomba crashes hard into everything and is so noisy. This one is still quieter than roomba but a bit rattely (is that a word?). I appreciate the quietness of this machine and that it doesn’t crash into everything. If it does come in contact it’s a gentle bump, roomba has moved chairs. So I have decided this one is more my favorite of the two.","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,4,Good for the price.,For some reason I never received a remote control. I got this to help with dog hair on my hard wood floors. Seems to pick up a lot of hair.

B0D9W3B622,4,Great sucker,"I was skeptical at first being I was not familiar with the brand name. I’ve had the unit approximately 3 weeks now and I am very pleased. The unit begins on schedule. Unbeknownst to me - I set a schedule when reviewing the remote for the first time. But it worked well. The unit takes about an 1 1/2 hours and finally returned to the base on its own. Just have to be careful with certain throw rugs. The rugs in my bathroom get stuck and I have to retrieve the unit. Simply I close the bathrooms doors when it starts. I do hear the sucking power change when going from area rug to hard floors. Wry pleased with that. I am very pleased and would recommend this unit.

B0D9W3B622,4,"Awesome for Pet hair, dirt, food particles even on carpet","I've been wanting one of these for years and finally took the plunge. The price was great for what I needed it for compared to the other high end ones out there that have a ton of bells and whistles. It works great. I put it in a room and close the door and it goes to town. The greatest thing is that I have a massive couch in the living room that has chaise lounge on each end that I can't move and it has a bunch of legs on it too so going up under it with a vacuum hose really doesn't get all the pet hair and dust bunnies out from under it and is back breaking! This thing will eventually go around and around each leg and get everything up. I even moved the couch afterwards with help and swept the floor just to see how well it cleaned up under there and seriously there was so little left that you could have put the dirt in a teaspoon. That's how well it cleaned. I give it 4 stars only because calling it back to the charging station takes it forever and sometimes it doesn't make it there without help and thin cheap rugs you will have to pick up because it will get caught on them, my thick heavy rugs it has no problem with and cleans them perfectly. Also had trouble getting the dust bin out but that was because the manufacturer didn't close the HEPA filter lid tightly and it was catching when I tried to get it out. I just took a slim piece of cardboard paper and slid it down in there to keep it from catching and it came out. Now I make sure when I clean the dust bin that lid on the HEPA filter is closed tightly and it comes out with ease every time.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2020"

It clearly worked because we had a filter full of dirt and fur after every room. We have used it on hard floors and carpet. It feels like it works better on the hard floors in terms of the feeling of cleanliness after. We have deep carpets and while it definitely does clean up a lot of whats in there, I'm not sure the suction is quite strong enough for it.

B0D9W3B622,3,Fine if you don't need a proper schedule,"This thing worked GREAT when I got it. I kept charging and running and charging and running it the first few days because it was pulling so much cat hair out of the carpet that my regular vacuum missed. After the first few days, I set the schedule and it went off and did its thing every afternoon when it was supposed to. My cats track litter everywhere, and this does a great job of cleaning up after them. It does tend to get stuck on things like my bath mat and the underside of my coffee table and cat toys (which are a struggle to get out of the wheels), so I often have to go rescue it. It will periodically stop and just beep for no apparent reason, but cleaning the hair out of the rollers or emptying the bin, or other times just pushing the power button, will get it going again. It does tend to get lost when going back to the dock, sometimes taking 30+ minutes (around which I'll go rescue it and put it on the dock myself). I've now had this thing for six months, and as of a few weeks ago, it no longer runs on schedule (and judging by the questions asked here, this isn't an uncommon problem). It doesn't even seem to have a pattern to when it runs. Today it started going at 10:20pm. Last week it frequently woke up around 4-5am. I've tried setting the clock and the scheduled run time, the vacuum beeps in response, yet still refuses to run when scheduled. I tried reaching out to the seller through Amazon, but I got an email from Amazon stating, ""there's a problem with the recipient's email system,"" and apparently the phone number doesn't work either, so I guess I'm on my own for figuring this out.","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2021"

B0D9W3B622,3,Sucks automatically,"Easy to use, good for one room, not practical as whole-home vacuum. The small tray must be emptied often which cancels out the convenience of not having to manually vacuum in my opinion. I have since bought a dyson upright vacuum and will be selling this robotic one.

B0D9W3B622,3,Won't be durable as your your hold vacuum that is still chugging along.,"So here we are in July. IT does an amazing job picking up cat hair and debris. My mom doesn't get teary eyes from the floating hair or smell. Very easy to clean. Goes on your average carpet, wouldn't recommend anything over 1 inch. - Where i think it went wrong. I would run this vacuum three times a day, each time it would pick up cat hair and debris filling tray. Cats are tabby so the hair isn't too long. I would clean filter and rollers once every two weeks. * The result of so much use was the vacuum started getting loud. Then very loud on flat surfaces. *** Contacted support *** They informed me to remove the rolling brush and run the unit. It was less noisy but still meh. So they offered replacement unit or refund. I decided to take a refund and get the same model or one that is same price with more features. - The refund was prorated by how many months i used it, their response ( The Refund we will provide to you: 178.70 - [ ( 178.70 / 12) x 6 ] = 89.35 $). I've never heard of any appliance manufacturer doing this sort thing when its 100% manufacturer issue and still within warranty period. The same unit would be nice but even running it less like once a day would get me about a year out of the robot before the roller brush motors give out. Pros - Amazing for cleaning pet hair and everyday vacuuming. I used human vacuum once every three weeks cause it does such nice job. - Necessary for anyone with time constraints. Moms at home with kiddos, professionals, students. I'd say its a must have. - Warranty customer service is through email and once a day responses as they are based in China. Cons - Don't expect more than a year out of this vacuum if you use daily and have pets. - Eats your cords - Attacks your toes (pro - if you are in to that sort of thing) - Expensive for a maybe a year of service and the prorated refund is lame. TIPS!!! If you can purchase a vacuum from a dependable no hassle 100% satisfaction (full refund) go with them. The roller motors are about $60+ if you want to replace yourself. So this sort of robot will be in goodwill or junk yard very soon. DO NOT BUY USED any Robot Vacuum!","Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2020"

It seemed the sensors weren’t working right. - Not as great for pet hair as it claims (however, I have two German shepherds with long hair, so I can’t totally blame a small vacuum) - Only works well when you’re using the remote. Hands free option and letting it do its thing did not give good results. I found it staying in one area of a room and rarely made it throughout the house. I figure the lack of mapping technology contributes to this. - Suction was not that great - even on Max - It would only find its way “home” about half the time.

Incredibly irritated and disappointed. Update: amazon is replacing. Will change review as needed, once time tells how well the replacement does. Update: It tries. It does. It wants to be a good vacuum. It just doesn't have the power. Also has gotten louder. I have two large, shedding dogs, though. If you have a non pet household, or even just one creature that doesn't shed small fur puppies, this vacuum would be a fine addition to the household.

B0D9W3B622,3,Update 9 month later.,Update: After 9 months of using it the robovac side brushes quit working properly and unit would just flash red and beep twice. Attempted mutliple resets and verified nothing jamming motors. Contacted manufacturer and they responded quickly and requested a video of the unit having the problem so I sent that to them. They confirmed the unit was having a problem and could not be fixed so they offered a refurbished unit or 41 dollars. They pro-rate the amount based on how long you've owned it during the warranty period. I chose the refurbished unit and it did arrive no problem after a couple weeks and it seems to work fine. Would give 4 or 5 stars if I knew how long the unit will last. Original review:This is a great little robovac that has options you find only on more expensive models. I have hardwood floors and this does a terrific job. Took only a few minutes to get it set up and charging up receipt. Have run it several times and have been very happy each time. I did have to raise power cords off the floor but I think that is normal for most any robovac. It will transition from hardwood to an low area rug no problem as long as it's not a thin floppy rug that does not rest on floor evenly. I have one of those floppy rugs and the machine tends to push it around sometimes vs going up and onto it.

It is constantly getting stuck on EVERYTHING and will just randomly stop in the middle of the room for no reason during it's pre-scheduled cycle. Everything trips it up and the spinning brushes are so constantly getting entangled on everything, I had to replace them both the very first week I had the thing. I have two large german sheperds and two kids so something that helps keep the dog hair off the floor is a godsend but unfortunately, it is not this machine.

B0D9W3B622,2,Downgraded review - started out pretty good but it is now landfill,"*****Update 9/6/22***** Just threw this in the trash. First, they had to send me another battery. Then the front brushes keep stopping and when the front brushes stop turning, the unit shuts itself off. This would happen occasionally, like once a week or so. And you have fiddle with it, turning it off and on and off and on and spinning the brushes manually until they start turning again and the vacuum would run. Sometimes it would stop again a few minutes later and sometimes they would run properly for days. But now they just no longer turn, no matter what I do. Also, this unit stopped picking up anything other than dust. Little bits would remain on the ground even after this unit swept over it several times. With the continual breakdowns and the complete decline in cleaning power, it just isn't worth the money. And now that it is broken down completely. My first robot vacuum lasted several years. This one just didn't hold up. *****Update 5/19/21***** So the company shipped me a new battery. I replaced it and it is now back to running about 2 hours. Hopefully this battery will last longer than 6 or so months. *****Original***** I purchased this vacuum about 7 months ago. I have owned several robot vacs and this is one of the better ones in this price range. The low profile prevents it from getting stuck under my cabinets or refrigerator, which happened often with my previous vacs. And it does a good job of cleaning. But here's why it gets a low star rating. Like I said, I have had the vacuum only 7 months. At first, this vacuum ran over 2 hours so it did a very thorough job of cleaning. But it has slowly shortened to the point where it only runs 30-45 minutes. So now my floors are still dirty even after it runs. My previous vac's battery lasted a couple years before it died. But 7 months and I have to replace the battery? I have reached out to the company and will update my review based on what they say/do.","Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2021"

B0D9W3B622,2,Great - while it lasted,"When iMartine first arrived, this little vacuum was a lifesaver during COVID. As a university professor, my workload increased dramatically during the last year, and this allowed me to clean my house while I worked. Even with 3 cats and 3 dogs that shed all over the house, this vacuum did an outstanding job of cleaning up the hair. I think it left my hardwood floors looking the best they've ever looked since I lived in this house (it's it possible the brushes polish the floor?!). Sadly, just 8 months after the purchase, I'm having issues with the brushes turning and even after replacing them twice, still end up with the vacuuming being interupted by the two beep warning telling me that the brushes are no longer turning. Sometimes I can get it going again by turning it off and on a couple of times and spinning the brushes myself a few rotations. Sometimes not, and I end up pulling out the Dyson to vacuum myself.

B0D9W3B622,2,Worked for a little while,"I bought this product based on the reviews, but I regret that decision now. It worked okay for the first two months. I clean out the tray and filter each time I use it. I have a small house. It is only cleaning approximately 600 sq ft. All hardwood too. Now it runs in a random pattern and never fully cleans the floors. I have taken out the battery to try to reset it. I have used all the settings on the remote. I have done everything. My house is basically a square shape with a section in the middle. It never goes all around the square. I have to physically pick it up to place it in a different room. It will run for an hour and never fully clean the floors. At this stage of the game, I guess it's just keeping me from having to vacuum quite as much, but I still have to vacuum behind it each time.

But after 2 months of use almost daily, the suction wasn't so great anymore. What made me finally return it was that the trash can got stuck and nothing could make it open and be emptied.

The hair gets caught around the spinning wheel and you have to untangle it with the little tool they give you. There were some issues here and there but overall we liked it, however it stopped working completely and kept saying the side brush was stuck even though we replaced the side brush, cleaned off the sensors etc. This issue had happened several times but this time it didn’t resolve and now it feels like we wasted so much money.","Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2020"

B0D9W3B622,2,Too stupid to function,"Almost too stupid to function. Programming this thing is a pain, what is more of a pain is the fact that it gets stuck on everything- yes, it would be nice to have my floor vacuumed every day, but I have to babysit the vacuum which kind of defeats the purpose I think only twice in the six months I have had it has it actually completes vacuuming without my assistance. Even when our floor is spotless it will still find some way to trap itself. I don’t believe the sensors are smart at all since it just bangs around on all of my furniture. I feel like it was a huge waste of money, and I wished I had saved up just a bit more and got a name brand vacuum. I had high hopes, but it doesn’t vacuum well, and it’s not smart enough to run independently.","Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2020"

I tried using the arrows on the remote control to help it her to those areas but it just makes it turn, it doesn't move straight ahead in the direction you press.

I have to hold the remote and click to pause and restart, each time it alarms, which makes it so annoying and beepy. It's not something that you can set in a room and leave. I have to babysit it the entire time its running. The spinning brushes at the front also recently topped spinning. It doesn't appear to be jammed with hair or dirt and I can't figure out why it isn't spinning. I wish I hadn't purchased this. I should have just gotten a regular vacuum that I can push.

B0D9W3B622,2,Easy to Clean and Use UPDATE: Battery life terrible,"UPDATE: Not yet 3 years later, the battery life is AWFUL. On a full charge it can barely pass over one room. Reducing my rating since it sucks to spend so much money on something that becomes useless so soon. I live with a dog that sheds like no other.. I brush this dog every other day and he still leaves tufts of fur every time I pet him. Our home fills up with fur pretty fast and cleaning so often was driving me crazy so I bought this robot vacuum. My life has been CHANGED. Having a robot vacuum is a real time saver and I let it clean the house every other day, but with supervision for the reasons I'll list. This robot isn't perfect but it's good enough so that I enjoy having it and don't regret my purchase. Not sure if it's the best robot vacuum on the market for certain households so hopefully my review can help. What works great: -It doesn't fall off stairs! I watched it run for the first time to make sure it was safe to let it run while I was gone. I was scared I was going to watch my $150 go down the drain because of robot death by stairs. However, the drop sensors work really well and it has never fallen down stairs. -Remote is easy to use. It gives you a lot of control over the robot and it's fun to move it around. -Can go on carpet and wood floors -Easy to empty and clean the filter -Works on short hair dog fur -Has a long battery life and can pass over the living room and kitchen several times. What does not work well: -Aggressively flips thinner rugs. We have a good amount of rugs in the home and some of them the vacuum will flip over. It won't get stuck but it'll toss the rugs around. -Aggressively bumps into everything. Sometimes it seems like it can sense the wall but sometimes it just rams into everything. I haven't had any of my wooden chairs damaged from the vacuum yet. -Does not work very well with long hair. While the dog has short hair, the humans have long hair. It will create tangles and clumps of long hair under the two front spinning brushes and twice within the past week one of the brushes will fall off because of the tangle. Once it creates the tangle it can't pick it up, but it's easy to pick up the clump of hair yourself. It is annoying to rip the hair off of the spinning brushes. -It takes a few passes over the floor to get everything clean. Because of the rug issue and sometimes getting stuck on objects I let the robot run under supervision only. It's still great to have since I can clean the stairs or something else as the robot runs and it speeds up cleaning.","Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2020"

B0D9W3B622,2,"Gets stuck too often, poor routing and cleans small area","This product is a chinese knock-off of a chinese product (Eufy). And I am not entirely happy with it. I have had it for half a year. Before it, had Eufy, but Eufy broke - twice. Good: Works, did not break yet. Cleans the hair well, and picks up small pieces of rubbish (like cat's food pellets) also well. Not overly loud. Bad: - suction is not sufficient. The advertised 1600 number requires a ""max"" setting which reduces battery life quite a bit. Needs to run over same place 3 - 4 times to really clean it. - intelligence of selecting a route is zero to none. Has a rectangle pattern ingrained, with a border follow-up if the rectangle fails. Prone to get stuck in between few distant objects if they are just positioned in the way it cannot deal with well. As a result, in the same time as Eufy, it cleans smaller area. - It is prone to be stuck under things much more frequently than Eufy because it does not understand it is stuck and tries forward until it is hopeless. - The brushes much more prone to tangling and being messed up.

B0D9W3B622,2,Not worth it,"I've had many of this type of robat vac, and this one is not so impressive. Granted, it's cheap, but it simply doesn't deliver. Most of the info below is in comparison to a low-end Neato (not Neato's top model). First, the good... Low profile fits under most furniture. Battery life is fine for an average size home (1500-2000sf). The bad... Although it does fit under most furniture, it apparently has no ability to see when it's a tight fit and regularly gets stuck under certain pieces of furniture in my house. It literally goes half way under, gets stuck, and simply stops. It beeps for a short while but stops warning the user much quicker than other brands. The sensors that 'look' at it's path appear to provide *no coverage of anything that's not actually on the floor, even if it's 2 or 3"" off the floor. This vacuum is quite clearly less intelligent than other brands. It gets stuck easily in corners, for instance. I have seen so many times where it will go into a corner near one of my couches. There is a fan that stands there, but there's a path a foot or so wide that it can sneak through, but then when it's in this 3x3' area, it cannot find it's way out, past the fan. It will spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to get out, and will eventually either die there or just give up, beep a while, then shut down. The same thing happens with objects that are not ""blunt"". For example, if you have a large box, or other object that appears to this vacuum as a ""wall"", then it will bump into it a few times and give up. However, if the obstacle appears as a ""ramp"" to this vacuum (imagine curved feet on something with legs), it will try and try and try to drive up the ramps. It's literally as if it simply doesn't even see them. As I type this, I'm realizing other brands seem to have visual sensors that this doesn't appear to have, or have as many, or it's simply not smart enough to handle what it's seeing. At the end of it's efforts, I still have to manually clean nearly every corner is my house. One last thing about this unit. Quite often, the unit doesn't start when it's supposed to, so I have to pick it up and flip it upside down, turn it off, wait a few seconds, then turn it back on. Then it will work as usual, which as you have read above, it's all that impressive. As far as leaving this thing to do it's job on it's own, forget about it. It's basically a vacuum that leaves dirty corners, gets stuck over half the time it's used, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2020"
B0D9W3B622,2,"Low vacuum power, Faulty stairway protection","I got my new Robovac (an IMartine Model IM2019) two weeks ago.On the first attempt to use it, it did a marvelous job of vacuuming my bedroom, which had accumulated a lot of dog hairs. On the second day, it cleaned another bedroom, but did not vacuum up a lot of particles on the rug that were moved by the ""whiskers"". On the third attempt, there were a lot of instances of particles that were moved but not vacuumed. On the last day, it was attempting to vacuum all the rooms on the second floor. I was not paying a lot of attention as it performed these duties. At some point, I noticed that it had become very quiet in the house. I went to find the IMartine, and it was down at the bottom on the stairs, upside down, and not running. Despite its design features that supposedly prevented it from falling down stairs, it had managed to take a high dive off the edge. Now I will be throwing away a fairly large investment with little to show for it. I owe the manufacturer a follow up. When I picked the vacuum up from the bottom of the stairs, the dust bin was jammed shut. After some prying with a couple of screwdrivers, I got it opened and there was lots of trash inside. The main brush was full of dog hairs. I emptied both and placed the unit on the charging dock. The light came on solid pink. The next day the light had changed to blue. I attempted to start the unit at that point and got nothing. That's when I wrote the earlier review. Today I rescued the unit from the trash and gave it another try. NO luck. However, I turned the unit over and rocked the power switch. To my surprise, the unit came back to life, and proceeded to clean the family room without further trouble.

However, within just a few months, it had already fallen down my stairs 8 times and the side brushes quit working all together. This caused the vacuum to quit altogether. This is in spite of me following all of the manufacturers cleaning and maintenance instructions that came with the vacuum. My vacuum worked for 3 months. This vacuum has a manufacture's warranty for 1 year. I contacted Amazon after the vacuum quit working and they provided a link to the manufacturer to file my concerns. I submitted all of my findings along with how I maintained the vacuum. They responded within three days asking for the same things I already provided along with a video of the problem. I replied with the requested information and then all went silent. I emailed them a again 1 week after submitting their required information. It took them 1 week to respond saying they are investigating a solution. All correspondence stopped at this point. That has been more then one month. This vacuum needs to be taken off of the market.

Do you have furniture in your home? if so, don't buy it. Do you have rugs or bath mats? If so, don't buy it. DO you expect dirt or fur to be picked up? if so, don't buy it. This vacuum has actually turned into a running joke at my house because if the vacuum is turned on myself or my daughter have to ""babysit"" this thing because it is inevitable that it is going to get stuck on any and every piece of furniture, and it will avoid any messes at all cost. At this point, the vacuum stays on the charger and I just sweep daily because the constant getting stuck on furniture and beeping is enough to drive a person insane. The sensors as advertises, are none existent, it runs into any and everything, humans, pets, walls, furniture. The one good thing I have to say is that the battery charge last at least 2 hours, which would be an awesome feature, if only it actually did its job, but at this point all I hear is 2 hours of beeps, so this is a very fancy appliance that has grown to collect dust.

Sensors have been looked at, it’s been charged, and I even swapped the brushes to the replacement ones that came in the box and still no luck. Received it late September and didn’t bother opening the box because we were moving to a new home soon. After moving in last week I was excited to try the vacuum and it worked well for one go round.

I oiled the side of the beater brush so that it would spin smoothly, but that only temporarily fixed the horrible, loud noise. The battery began to lose power after ten months of use too. It would run for twenty minutes, then need to go back to the dock to recharge. Now, 14 months later, it is totally dead. I wouldn't recommend this vacuum unless you are vacuuming maybe 500 square feet, or less, maybe once per week or even less, if you want it to last. Not recommended for bigger spaces, or a home with pets. Save your money and the environment and invest in a quality brand, like a Roomba.

It worked great the first couple of weeks, and cleaning and emptying the storage is a fairly straight forward process but the negatives far outweigh the positives. Ultimately, I will be returning. - It's really good with hair. Litter, sprinkles, little pieces of dirt it doesn't suction at all even right after the machine has been cleaned. It takes spilled cat litter and spurts it around spreading it all over the room and ironically creates a bigger mess. - It moves with really no rhyme or reason. It moves aimlessly and after a whole hour still misses entire chunks of the floor. It's incredibly frustrating to watch. - Will need to cover the same spot 2 or 3 times to get a good clean. - It gets stuck at least once per cleaning use despite my furniture being lined up against the walls. - It's a lot noisier than I thought it was going to be. I'm fortunate to live in a house. In an apartment with non-carpeted floors, there are high chances that it would be too noisy. - Overall it's less frustrating and more time-saving to use a regular vacuum and just do it yourself.","Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2020"

She (Rosie) went haywire (started going in reverse) in less than a year but while she was working my floors were spic and span. I decided to try something a little more expensive WITHOUT the mop feature hoping to gain some longevity. So I purchased this one with a beater bar (Marti). SO Rosie and MArti clean like a woman and a man. Rosie ...Spic and span but totally went bazerk after 7 months and now needs therapy. Marti has a well thought out clean out ..... SOOOO much nicer. That is where the good ends. Why Marti comes with a beater bar I will never know.. It does nothing but pick things up and deposit them on my 2 throw rugs (I have bare floors). NOT ONCE have I emptied dog hair from the hopper! Marti just wraps it all around himself and then beeps angrily at me for ""Maintenance"" I have run this vac for 2 weeks and had to ""service him"" 4 times. I swear it is like we are dating! Rosie picked up EVERYTHING and never complained. Marti runs around the house and SQUEAKS CONSTANTLY as if he is saying ..""look at me I am cleaning"". Rosie was so simple. Hit go and she would take off. Marti I have to ""warm him up"" on the remote and dang near get on my knees and touch the remote to Marti to get him to go. every 3 days I have to shave the hair off his beater bar and wiggle his drive wheel. (I cannot get it removed so I have to wiggle it until some debris comes out. Marti's receptacle NEVER has any hair in it...only dirt. Rosie picked up dirt and hair and rocks.

B0D9W3B622,1,Gets stuck frequently - Disappointing!!!,"It has been almost four months since I bought this robo vac. I've used it 8 or 9 times in that timeframe. It worked like it was supposed to initially, redirecting itself whenever it bumped into a piece of furniture and returning to its docking station when its battery got low. But then it started stopping and beeping at me every one or two minutes. It would stop and beep in the middle of the floor, so it wasn't even doing it when it got stuck under a piece of furniture. I then had to re-start it manually. It would then work for another minute or two before stopping and beeping again. This meant I had to be in the same room with it in order to restart it each time. Also, it stopped returning to its docking base on its own. It would just run out of power in the middle of the floor, and I had to return it manually. It's pretty useless if I have to supervise it this carefully. It's much faster and more efficient just to clean your floor with a regular vacuum cleaner. I finally threw out my iMartine. This was my first robot vac and it will be my last. What a disappointing experience!!","Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2020"

B0D2XXSPCR,5,"An overview of this low cost but highly efficiency, low noise, and many features added","I have been searching for a robotic vacuum and mop combo, and I picked this product to try out due to the low price and the features it offers that meet my needs. I have run several tests with this product, and here are my thought with pros and cons after using it. Pros: Package and shipping: I received the product on time as advertised on Amazon. It came well packed with double boxes. Inside the box, the vacuum and accessories were well packed, and all the components are included as advertised. Out of the box, it took me less than five minutes to set it up without reviewing the APP Instruction. The trash bin, brushes, mopping pad, and water tank are easy to install and empty with basic common sense. The buttons on the robot itself and on the remote control are well displayed with large, embedded symbols that really help with my aging vision. The instructions are clearly written with pictures included that really helps. Battery charging and run time: To put the battery life on real test, and I ran several tests with both features vacuum and mopping on hardwood, tiles, and vinyl floor. The average I got is about +/- 110 minutes. Not bad for this little robot. Frankly speaking, I have used many robotic vacuums before, and I’ve learned that the battery life never met the specs which advertised by the manufactures. The battery life always run shorter than the specs. This product runs very quiet, and this is important for me because I have tinnitus, and I am sensitive to certain level of loud noise and frequencies. The automatic self-charging seems to work well on this product. It found the charge station every time and it has not missed once yet. Modes, mapping, and navigation: I tested all three modes: Edge cleaning mode, Z path, and Auto. The mapping and navigation system seem to work well. The entire living room was vacuumed and mopped spotless. Due to the layout of my house, my favorite mode is the Auto. Vacuum and mopping: the suction is strong to collect dust, hair, and small particles on the hardwood, vinyl, tile, and edge. Also, the vacuum has no issue climbing itself over the ¼ inch high floor transition strip. Empty the trash bin is a very simple and intuitive process. For the mopping, I used warm water and added a few drops of Clorox. Since my room size is large, I manually filled out the water once. Sensors: if the object is a wall or solid, the sensors detect well and won’t bump into the wall and obstacles. Cons: This product does not ship with 2 AAA batteries for the remote control. This is not big of a deal, but it would help to include the batteries. Other than that, I do not have any negative about this product YET. I will update my review again after a few months of use. I personally do not use the mobile app with this product. The remote control is more than enough for me to use it. Moreover, I do not want to share personal information with any foreign companies. If you prefer to use the mobile app, follow the instruction to scan the QR code with your smartphone, and the correct app pops up immediately. In conclusion, I really like this combo product due to the low cost and the functionalities it offers. The build is solid, the low noise, and the battery life are all critical for me to consider this product. I highly recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Small but Mighty Machine!,"From the moment I set up this vacuum, I was impressed by how intuitive and easy the process was. I love the ability to control it with my phone, and how agile it is while on the go. What’s even more remarkable is how effectively it cleans. My floors have never looked better! Whether it’s navigating around furniture or picking up every speck of dust, dog hair, and debris, this little device works tirelessly and flawlessly. It charges quickly, and the battery lasts long-term. It takes alot in and doesn't require emptying as often as I thought it might. I have very long and large wooden floors, so no longer having to worry about daily sweeping or vacuuming has saved me countless hours of effort. Its efficiency, thoroughness, and ability to tackle various surfaces are truly impressive. I am genuinely amazed at the technology behind this product and how seamlessly it fits into home. Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,It's worth the price.,"I recently upgraded to the Tipdiy Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo, and overall, it’s been a solid addition to my cleaning routine. I live in about a 900 sq ft condo with two cats, so hair and debris are a constant challenge. The vacuum does a great job of picking up cat fur, dust, and dirt, which is a relief considering how much shedding my cats do. One thing to note is that it’s slower than its previous model. While it does a good job covering the area, it takes a bit more time to finish cleaning than my old robot vacuum. I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about this at first, but I’ve come to appreciate the trade-off because the battery life has significantly improved. It runs longer now, which means I can set it to clean and not worry about it running out of juice halfway through my condo. The mop function is also a nice touch. It doesn’t replace a deep clean, but for regular upkeep, it does a good job of handling spills and light messes, especially with the cats around. It’s easy to set up, and I love that it can switch between vacuuming and mopping automatically. Overall, while the slower pace is noticeable, the longer runtime and improved cleaning performance make up for it. If you have pets and a medium-sized space like mine then it is a solid choice for daily maintenance.","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Robot Vacuum with Very Useful features,"My primary reason for purchasing a robot vacuum cleaner is to control the accumulation of pet hair and dust on the floor, particularly under the table and against walls. While running the vacuum at least every other day, I can do other tasks. I am very pleased with the purchase, and the vacuum helps me to meet the pet hair control objective. The positives for this product are: *Front loading water tank and filter assembly *Changes course when encountering obstacles *Good suction of pet hairs *Different cleaning modes to apply to a variety of cleaning scenarios *Mopping function helps remove dust and very light stains *Lightweight and low noise level *Reasonably priced Cons: *The instruction booklet doesn't explicitly state how to use the mopping or spot cleaning modes *Frequent emptying of dust tank is necessary *Not programed to detect areas of very low clearance Overall, I am very satisfied with this robot vacuum. The available functions/modes are very useful for my objectives (keeping a large open area from accumulating significant pet hairs and loose dirt/dust). An example of a useful mode is in the spot cleaning mode. If there is a specific area with dirt or hairs, the vacuum can be quickly placed there for the spot cleaning mode. Then, the auto mode can be resumed. The mopping mode comes in handy to remove fine dust that is commonly tracked onto the floor (see wet streak in the video). These uses can free up time to concurrently do other tasks around the house. Finally, the vacuum is reasonably priced for the features available.","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024"

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Great robot cleaner that both vacuums and mops,"We were looking for an additional robot vac cleaner since our original cleaner got dedicated to our craft room over the garage. Our original robot cleaner was a ROPVACNIC and we were pleased the way it vacuumed the floors, both carpet and LVP. So, we were happy to find out that they came out with a robotic cleaner that vacuums and mops. This robotic cleaner is awesome. In addition to mopping this new model has new features such as being able to control the vacuum suction and has a longer battery life. It comes with a remote or you can download an app and control the robot from your phone. Both are easy to use. The vacuum suction is more powerful on this model and my carpets look great picking up more dirt that I expected. The best part is the mop feature! Not only does it mop but it saves my back! I have a bad back and mopping the kitchen floor was always a chore. My kitchen floor looks great, so this is definitely a game changer for me. I am very pleased the results on both the carpet and tile/LVP floors. This is a great robotic cleaner and you can't beat it for the price.","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Great Mop Vac for the Price!,"I had always wanted to buy a mop vac but was a little skeptical considering how expensive some brands can be and not being quite sure how clean the mop vac would actually be. Then I stumbled upon this little gem, we had purchased the robot vacuum from this company and were very pleased so when we saw they offered a mop vac, and at a decent and reasonable price, we decided to try. It came packaged beautifully, no problems there. It was super easy to set up and connect to our wifi and phones to control through an app which is lovely. And I do have to say, it does a pretty good job getting the mopping and vacuuming done. It did take a minute to figure out my house, not going to lie, I got a little worried because it stayed in the general area of my living room for a good while before it ventured out to the rest of the floors. But the suction power is pretty good to pick up the little things on the floor and the mopping is efficient enough to clean up minor messes on the floor. Obviously is not like an actual hand mop so take that into consideration. One thing I do have to say that I’m not really thrilled about is how it hits my furniture. Sometimes the sensors pick up on point and it completely avoids even brushing a particular piece of furniture but sometimes especially when it hits head on, it hits and bangs pretty hard. It’s a tiny light weight machine so it’s obviously not going to cause damage….at least I hope not, but just hearing the sound of the bumping freaks me out. Other than that….if you’re in search of a reasonably priced mop vac….dont hold back from trying this one. It’s worth it so far.","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Great for what it does,"I bought this vacuum for my beach condo. I already had the ROPVACNIC dry vac and like how it performs. Even if I first vacuum with my upright, then let the ROPVACNIC go, I am continually amazed how much additional dust and debris it collects. So when they came out with this vacuum with a mop feature I thought it would be good to try in the condo which collects a lot of sand. So far I am just as impressed. Set up and initial charging was simple. I have not yet tried the app as I wanted to test the basic performance. It cleaned well, has great battery life, and is very quiet. Seems to be very intuitive as to how to get out of jams. The mop feature is nice but it will not replace general mopping. It wets a microfiber cloth that is attached with Velcro along the bottom. It doesn’t suck up dirty water will not deep clean your floors. I really do highly recommend this little vacuum, it performs as well as my original ROPVACNIC and the mop feature is a plus. I do not think you will be disappointed purchasing this unit.","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Game Changer!,"This thing is so much fun! I have personally named mine “Alfred” but that’s besides the point. One thing about Alfred is that he does not connect to the WiFi is my current living location. I work for a Housing department at a college and therefore am partially paid with an on campus apartment, meaning that I use the college’s WiFi. You need to have your own 2.4ghz connection to properly connect using the app. The remote still works perfectly fine with Alfred, but you do need to purchase AAA batteries as it does not come with any. I also want to mention that I’ve only had it for 3 days so I cannot talk about long term usage, but I can confirm it vaccums and mops very well! You do have to be careful about chargers or any sort of cords touching the ground as it will grab them and keep moving forward which either results in your cord being relocated or the robot getting stuck! Since this robot doesn’t have a tank with its charger, you need to clean it out every couple times it cleans your place (probably every time if you have a large space).","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Truthful Review,I gave it 5 stars because I got it on sale and its worth the value I paid for it. Would I get a different one if Im willing to pay more…yes. This vacuum works awesome. You have to change the settings to maximum suction for best results but works good on low. Mop works but if you add the water it will drag the wet pad over your carpet. At first one of the wheels was having a problem I thought I would have to return it but it’s worked its self out. I have a dog that sheds and it’s awesome with picking up dog hair. The remote doesn’t turn it off and the manual directions doesn’t really work. It also has a app that one will turn it off but manual still doesn’t work. Over all it works great now I want one that is self emptying and has a smarter mop system. Over all this is great its the gateway to investing in one.

And, we have 30 rescue cats! The remote is tricky, because when you push the ""on"" button, it flashes red. I didn't think it was working, but pushed other buttons and the commands worked. The only complaint I have is she doesn't always want to go ""home."" I've tried pressing the home button from the dining room and the dock is in the living room and no response. It seems she needs to be right in front of the dock to actually put herself onto it. Now, why did I post a picture of one of our cats, Julia? Hence, the title of this review!

B0D2XXSPCR,5,"Tipdiy Robot Vacuum and Mop is the best, love it!!!","This product is excellent! I’ve finally found the perfect robot vacuum and mop for my house. My home has both hardwood and tile floors, and the Tipdiy robot vacuum and mop performed effortlessly on both surfaces. The cleaning power is noticeably stronger, picking up hair, dirt, and small debris like grains, leaving the floors spotless after each session. The brush roll didn’t get tangled with hair, and any loose strands were easily removed by hand, making maintenance quick and simple. I was particularly impressed with the mapping feature, which was easy to set up and resulted in an accurate map. The mop quickly wiped away a stubborn sticky patch on the tile floor with ease The navigation is incredibly precise; it moves strategically, rarely missing any spots. Another standout feature is the noise level, it's much quieter, allowing it to run without disturbing anyone in the house. The battery life is equally impressive, easily covering the entire cleaning process on a single charge. Scheduling cleanings is intuitive, with the option to easily adjust the times to suit my needs. The Tipdiy robot vacuum and mop offers superior cleaning power, battery life, and noise control. I’m thrilled with this purchase and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable cleaner for their home.

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Amazing Price for Such a Powerful Vacuum and Mop Combo Cleaner,"I rarely write a review for a product. But I am very happy about this new robot of mine. For a low price, most robots can only vacuum. I like the fact that this one can mop too. Compared to my old Shark vacuum, this one is way stronger and has more functions. The cleaner is easy to set up and the App is easy to install. I LOVE the Manual mode option in the App. I usually let the robot clean in Auto mode, BUT when I see it running to places I don't like, I can press the Manual mode and direct it to a different direction, without having to stand up and move it. In addition to the App, this robot comes with a remote control, which is a bonus if you don't want to download the app.","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,It is not perfect but it does the job,"Upon the first trial test of this new robot mop/vac, I found that the machine has some hits and misses. Firstly, the good points: it is quiet, vacuums well, does not leave any puddles on the floor, has a long running time, has a big compartment for water containment and debris collection, and leaves the area where it cleaned a bit shinier. The bad points: it gets stuck on the edges of stairs and does not know how to turn around from stair edges, the mop does not thoroughly clean stuck on stains like dried dirt or food, and there is only one mop pad that comes with the unit so the user has to frequently use the same mop pad. I recommend this vacuum mop if you are looking for something to help you maintain a somewhat clean floor on a regular basis. I don’t think it is appropriate to use for a deep cleaner.","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2024"

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Best Robot Vacuum for the money,"I have had several robot vacuums over the years. They typically perform well enough to keep the pet hair in check but I still have to go back and mop every weekend. It was a real pleasure to discover that there is an all-in-one robot vacuum that will perform both functions. The mop is not for heavy duty cleaning like big spills or stains, you will still need some elbow grease to deal with those, but for small spills that dry and leave rings, spots, etc. It's perfect. The rotating brushes are superior to both the robot vacuums I've owned before and instead of a roller in the center, which always gets bound up with pet hair and carpet fibers, it has a port that sucks up the material into the detachable bin. This is a superior design for people who have hardwood floors and low pile carpets like area rugs around different areas of the house.

The directions are a little funky and could be more clear. 3. It is easy to start and set up though. 4. This will not pick up big pieces of food or items (goldfish, etc). 5. It does pick up all of the crumbs from my toddler and cat hair though. 6. It can get under my couches which is very nice. 7.

B0D2XXSPCR,5,New robot vacuum with mopping capability,"I was ready to get a robot vacuum after holding off for a few years. I figured, they would have figured out how to improve on its functionality and reliability. Then, it now comes with mopping capability. I like doing the vacuum first by closing the water dripping then do the mopping. But, if you do the vacuuming every day, I don’t see the need to mop every day unless you are tracking wet tracks inside. With the random setting, the robot goes in all directions. I wish it would try to vacuum and mop in a regular pattern to maximize the cleaning area and less chance of missing a spot. The robot is good on picking up the dog hair and dust bunnies that she didn’t have to do the daily vacuuming. The only thing I wish the manufacturer can figure out is for the vacuum to have a sensor that prevents it from going under a tight spot so as not to get stuck every time. This vacuum got stuck 3 times going under a Pack and Play. I also wished that it can improve on getting under a cabinet that it would not get stuck by going back and forth when it’s time to go back for recharging.

I'm only on the 2nd day of owning it, but it's pretty amazing so far. I think there are far more advanced robots but all I really need is to let it loose and do it's job. It hops up on the area rugs, navigates around furniture, goes under my desk etc. The only thing it doesn't do well with is cords on the ground.

The day after the event was the first time I used the machine and I was amazed, when cleaning the filter, etc. to see the amount of grass, leaves, and hair that it picked up that did not decrease its efficiency. There is a remote control and ways to better direct it to clean, but I have stuck to ""random"". The mopping leaves some streaks, but there is no doubt that my floors are cleaner. The machine beeps if it gets stuck under low lying furniture, but it does not happen as frequently as I expected.

We bought the Ropvacnic vacuum about a month ago and were skeptical, but hopeful it would lighten the cleaning load. We started running it in the main living area of our house at night and were thrilled by the results on both the laminate flooring and large area rug. When we learned about the vacuum/mop combo, we jumped at the opportunity to try it out and have had zero regrets. Assembly was easy and now it is SO nice to be able to literally push a button and walk away. (I know it's probably common sense, but just in case... keep in mind that big chunks of food, whole leaves, etc. won't get suctioned up, and super sticky messes will require some pre-scrubbing.) We absolutely recommend this to anyone looking to decrease hands-on time spent cleaning!","Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Exceeds my expectations,"I love the fact this vac didn't have a rotating brush, because things get rolled up in the brushes. I am using it on a tiles floor which I will also mop so having a straight suction is preferred. I like that using the remote I can increase or decrease suction. When mopping, I can also select the amount water used while mopping. It did exactly what it was supposed to do. It does a thorough job cleaning. I would definitely recommend and buy again down the road.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Very pleased,"I always thought that a robot mop was a waste of time. But I have to admit that I am pleasantly surprised with the performance of this robovacumm. Though it did take a while to clean the room, it did a great job cleaning it. I haven't set it up with the app, so I don't j know if that's why it didn't map the room. Once I do this, I will update my review. I couldn't get it to avoid my carpet, though I kind of rolled it up so it wouldn't go thru it. Other than that, I'm very satisfied. It's not loud, and it left the floor spot cleaned. Certainly recommended.","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Affordable option,"I haven’t used this for long, but so far I am really liking it! It doesn’t get stuck too often and picks up a lot of dust and dirt. One thing I do like from my previous model is hair doesn’t get stuck in the brush bristles as much. The dirt container is also larger. Overall cuts back on sweeping and vacuuming which is a win! I haven’t tried the mop feature yet or the wifi, but I am excited finally try it out.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Excellent performance for the price,"I've only had it a week but it does a really great job keeping the pet hair under control. A great value. The algorithm does a good job of getting my moderately complicated floor layout from corner to corner. It only got stuck twice: once on some cords that needed to be managed better and once on my pet food mat, which I have to put up before I let it loose. Otherwise, its pretty clever. I'm not sure about the mopping feature. It just drags a damp microfiber cloth over your floor. It helps a little, I suppose. I wasn't looking for one with a mop so it doesn't really factor for me. It's just a nice touch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Going to be hard to beat this vac/mop!,"I've always been hesitant to buy one of these robot vac/mop units but I have 2 dogs and the amount of hair on my floors is unreal. The setup was simple and it was on my wifi within 5 minutes of opening the box. After filling the mop with water and setting a schedule I let it run for a few days in the middle of the night. It performed flawlessly, didn't get stuck anywhere and ended up on the charger the next morning. All I need to do is empty the collection box every couple of days and all is well. Plus it runs so quiet that it doesn't bother the dogs or the family while it's running in the middle of the night. Highly recommend this unit at this price point. Going to be hard to beat.","Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Great product for the price.,"Love this vacuum. Have been using it for about 3 weeks now. Love how quiet it is, it has very good cleaning suction picks up all my dog hair.

It can be used as a vacuum only or vacuum and mop at the same time. Would definitely buy again and recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Very satisfied,"We purchased the vacuum and mop combo cleaner after having purchased the vacuum cleaner previously and truly enjoying the product.

I will gladly purchase another one!","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,I love it!,"I always thought a Roomba was a luxury item, until I saw this one at a discounted rate. I love everything about Buddy Marshmellow, the name my daughter and I gave it. Easy to assemble and use. There’s an app that you can download to schedule cleanings and manual direction, very simple to use. It’s quiet and picks up very well. It goes back to its home base with the press of the home button. I highly recommend the Tipdiy Robot.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Worth the price,I am a big fan of timesaving. I love robot vacuums but this is the first time I have used one with a mop attached. It works surprisingly well. Definitely worth the price. I will use it for touchups to extend time between regular mopping. I foster animals and have 6 dogs and 6 cats. Dirty paw prints are a daily event so it is nice not to have to bend over and clean them up all the time. Let the robot do it!

I saw that they came out with the robot mop vacuum and I thought it would something really great for my hardwood floors. When I tested it in my room it was great!

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Great value!!!,"If you are trying to decide between this or one of those more expensive iRobot roombas, definitely go with this! It cleans better than my other $300 roomba so it is great value. The setup is pretty straightforward and simple. The battery is more than good enough for my relatively large house. I love the design with the matte black on top, which makes it look very modern. It is also a game changer if you own pets. I have a husky and a golden retriever and they both shed a lot of fur especially around this time of the year, and I honestly cannot emphasize enough how much you need a roomba if you are a pet owner.

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Enjoyed using this.,"After using this for several days, here is my feedback... Pro's -Good suction power, photos show after one 30 minute run how much it collected. We run a robot vacuum once or twice a day. And every time I am so surprised by all that it picks up! Collects both bigger pieces and small dust. -Easy to use, set-up, charge. Easy remote. -Navigates easily around furniture / corners / walls. -Is fairly quiet and has 3 modes of power to reduce noice. -Has a button on remote you can let out more water when you want. -Remote helps steer the unit when it’s heading to a spot you want to avoid. Con's: -Think of the mop feature as a ""wet dusting” of your floor as opposed to a deep cleaning. More like a swiffer mop on wheels. -Because the attached microfiber cloth stays on and is wet, wherever the vacuum goes the microfiber cloth goes, including rugs/carpet. So you'll need to adjust and move/block things you don't want getting wet. Summary: Powerful vacuum. Long run time. This would be a good unit in addition to your regular cleaning devices for hands free light upkeep.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

B0D2XXSPCR,4,Not Too Bad,"Play Video My first time ever owning a robot vac. I have a Dalmatian and her fur is like little needles. The vac does pretty well picking up her fur. It is loud, but I don't mind. It's definitely not quicker than sweeping. It takes awhile to get every spot. It'll pass a spot several times before going over it. This is great for big families or people who don't get around much. It's seems pretty sturdy and the connection seems fine. It does get stuck sometimes behind things and it can't find its way out.

B0D2XXSPCR,4,Great for in-between deep cleansing.,Love that it can just run and clean all the loose stuff off the floors. A little difficult to map and control by remote but worth figuring out.

B0D2XXSPCR,4,A nice fill-in between cleaning sessions,"It works well as a supplement for true mopping. I have the standalone vacuum version, and this one seems to do a better job in the vacuuming department. The mop function is ok, but it's no substitute for actually mopping. You can see as it's running that it's not getting every spot on the floor. For the price point it's a good way to keep the floor tidy in between full cleaning sessions.","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,3,Not good for pet families,"Ease of setting up: We give this a 2. The instructions were not clear. It took us several attempts to get it set up and working. Vacuum: 3- If you have pets, this vacuum is not for you. We tried it on our tile floor. It did not pick up everything. After just a small amount of space, it left dirt and pet hair. The suction is not strong. Mop: We give this a 3. The mopping was better and we can see where it did get the floor wet. The mop cloth did come back dirty. You just can only do a small area. If you have an apartment with no pets, or a small house with no pets, this would be ok. The charging ability is good. It seems sturdy for small apartments or small houses.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,3,Remote is not that good but vacuum is good,"The robot vacuum runs well, does do a decent job with it's suction. You can use your phone or the remote to control the robot. However, the remote has issues communicating with the robot. I had to use the app for what I needed so the remote is useless as it barely even works. The app is the only way to program the robot for scheduled cleanings. I also had the app wash the robot out without warning so I had to reprogram it back in and redo it's schedule. It is also the only way to locate it when the robot gets stuck someplace. If you're ok with having another app on your phone then this robot seems to do the job with the app fine. I wanted to be able to use the remote more for my robot because I prefer not having apps on my phone. Another fault of the robot is the robot seems to keep re vacuuming the same area over and over. Over all, the vacuum works, but nothing super special.","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2024"

From the living room to the kitchen floor is slightly elevated and was able to get up over the lip and continue on its way.

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Truthful Review,I gave it 5 stars because I got it on sale and its worth the value I paid for it. Would I get a different one if Im willing to pay more…yes. This vacuum works awesome. You have to change the settings to maximum suction for best results but works good on low. Mop works but if you add the water it will drag the wet pad over your carpet. At first one of the wheels was having a problem I thought I would have to return it but it’s worked its self out. I have a dog that sheds and it’s awesome with picking up dog hair. The remote doesn’t turn it off and the manual directions doesn’t really work. It also has a app that one will turn it off but manual still doesn’t work. Over all it works great now I want one that is self emptying and has a smarter mop system. Over all this is great its the gateway to investing in one.

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Great for what it does,"I bought this vacuum for my beach condo. I already had the ROPVACNIC dry vac and like how it performs. Even if I first vacuum with my upright, then let the ROPVACNIC go, I am continually amazed how much additional dust and debris it collects. So when they came out with this vacuum with a mop feature I thought it would be good to try in the condo which collects a lot of sand. So far I am just as impressed. Set up and initial charging was simple. I have not yet tried the app as I wanted to test the basic performance. It cleaned well, has great battery life, and is very quiet. Seems to be very intuitive as to how to get out of jams. The mop feature is nice but it will not replace general mopping. It wets a microfiber cloth that is attached with Velcro along the bottom. It doesn’t suck up dirty water will not deep clean your floors. I really do highly recommend this little vacuum, it performs as well as my original ROPVACNIC and the mop feature is a plus. I do not think you will be disappointed purchasing this unit.","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2024"

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Game Changer!,"This thing is so much fun! I have personally named mine “Alfred” but that’s besides the point. One thing about Alfred is that he does not connect to the WiFi is my current living location. I work for a Housing department at a college and therefore am partially paid with an on campus apartment, meaning that I use the college’s WiFi. You need to have your own 2.4ghz connection to properly connect using the app. The remote still works perfectly fine with Alfred, but you do need to purchase AAA batteries as it does not come with any. I also want to mention that I’ve only had it for 3 days so I cannot talk about long term usage, but I can confirm it vaccums and mops very well! You do have to be careful about chargers or any sort of cords touching the ground as it will grab them and keep moving forward which either results in your cord being relocated or the robot getting stuck! Since this robot doesn’t have a tank with its charger, you need to clean it out every couple times it cleans your place (probably every time if you have a large space).","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2024"

The cleaner is easy to set up and the App is easy to install. I LOVE the Manual mode option in the App. I usually let the robot clean in Auto mode, BUT when I see it running to places I don't like, I can press the Manual mode and direct it to a different direction, without having to stand up and move it.

Whether it’s navigating around furniture or picking up every speck of dust, dog hair, and debris, this little device works tirelessly and flawlessly. It charges quickly, and the battery lasts long-term. It takes alot in and doesn't require emptying as often as I thought it might.

And, we have 30 rescue cats! The remote is tricky, because when you push the ""on"" button, it flashes red. I didn't think it was working, but pushed other buttons and the commands worked. The only complaint I have is she doesn't always want to go ""home."" I've tried pressing the home button from the dining room and the dock is in the living room and no response. It seems she needs to be right in front of the dock to actually put herself onto it. Now, why did I post a picture of one of our cats, Julia? Hence, the title of this review! She figured out how to push the button and get Beastie to vacuum, and then she follows her and tries to bunny kick her!

The directions are a little funky and could be more clear. 3. It is easy to start and set up though. 4. This will not pick up big pieces of food or items (goldfish, etc). 5. It does pick up all of the crumbs from my toddler and cat hair though. 6. It can get under my couches which is very nice. 7.

It's easy to use and keeps the floors tidy with minimum effort; thus, this is great for daily cleaning. I also appreciate the included remote control, which adds convenience.

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Best money we've spent in years.,"This little vacuum is worth every penny and more. Vacuums the house, the whole 1800 sq. ft of the house. Under the beds, dressers, alarm if it gets stuck, ( which has only happened twice in a week of daily trials because of our shedding lab.) Excellent value, does better than ever expected. Very durable, goes over low carpet, just amazing.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Very satisfied,"We purchased the vacuum and mop combo cleaner after having purchased the vacuum cleaner previously and truly enjoying the product. I have used the product for about a week and have no complaints. The suction of the vacuum is very good, and you can visibly see signs that the mop is cleaning the floors as it should be. The product is easy to use. I keep a very clean home so this product allows me to feel confident that my floors are always well maintained! I will gladly purchase another one!","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2024"

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Great vacuum that gets the job done!,The vacuum was easy to get set up and use out of the box. It was able to move around our house without getting stuck and cover the floors well with its mapping function. It feels sturdy and well built and battery power has not been an issue. We are super excited for the mop feature to clean our laminate flooring and has done a great job. I’m always amazed at all the dirt it finds and it is worth every penny for keeping the house clean.

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Mops great!,I was pleasantly surprised at how powerful and efficient this robot vacuum and mop is! I had areas where food was stuck to the floor and the mop got it up without issue! I thought for sure I would have to go back over some areas and hand wipe but I didn't! This vacuum/mop does not disappoint. It cleaned the entire floor and got the corners really clean too.

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Super efficient for the price,I have two dogs and the winter makes it hard to keep paw prints wiped and mopped up. This is perfect! This doesn’t replace my normal cleaning but it’s good for the in between when I don’t have a lot of time. I was pleasantly surprised how much dust and hair this picks up as well. Comes with an app that you can tell it what to do from the app.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,It is not perfect but it does the job,"Upon the first trial test of this new robot mop/vac, I found that the machine has some hits and misses. Firstly, the good points: it is quiet, vacuums well, does not leave any puddles on the floor, has a long running time, has a big compartment for water containment and debris collection, and leaves the area where it cleaned a bit shinier. The bad points: it gets stuck on the edges of stairs and does not know how to turn around from stair edges, the mop does not thoroughly clean stuck on stains like dried dirt or food, and there is only one mop pad that comes with the unit so the user has to frequently use the same mop pad. I recommend this vacuum mop if you are looking for something to help you maintain a somewhat clean floor on a regular basis. I don’t think it is appropriate to use for a deep cleaner.","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Pequeña gran aspiradora trapeadora,"Está aspiradora es pequeña, pero a mí me ha encantado, ya que me ayuda a mantener limpia la casa, mientras yo realizo otras actividades ella se encarga de limpiar el piso, y lo ha hecho muy bien, sobretodo en las habitaciones, cierro la puerta y la pongo a trabajar, me encanta que cabe muy bien abajo de camas y sillones, así puedo mantener limpias esas áreas sin mayor esfuerzo, no es muy ruidosa, la carga de batería le dura bastante, tiene varios ajustes de adhesión y control de agua en el modo de trapeador, regresa sola a su estación de carga, me gusta que la app es muy sencilla y es fácil manejarla con el móvil, también puedes ver los niveles de carga y la vida útil del filtro y escobillas, de los cuales trae repuesto incluido.

I will use it for touchups to extend time between regular mopping. I foster animals and have 6 dogs and 6 cats. Dirty paw prints are a daily event so it is nice not to have to bend over and clean them up all the time. Let the robot do it!

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Fantastic Vacuum/Mop!,I absolutely love the Tipdiy Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo. I received it with perfect packaging. It was very simple to set up and charge which was mostly already charged so I was able to try it out quicker. The vacuum works great and is slim enough to go under my cabinets and it picked up everything on the floor. I have 3 dogs and a cat so I vacuum and mop alot. I next tried out the mop adding the water and the mop attachment and it worked great! I have tile and wood floooring and it went through my living area and kitchen quickly and efficiently. I absolutely love my new robot vacuum and I highly recommend the product.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Mop and vacuum,I received my Tipdiy mop vacuum yesterday and charged it up to full. I had vacuumed before I turned it on and off it ran.

I appreciated not having a roller brush to dig the pet hair out.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,This vacuum is a great value for the money,I have to admit I was skeptical at first about how well it would mop however it works quite well. I found that wedding.

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Good on non-carpeted floors!,"Play Video We’ve had this vacuum for one day, and so far, for initial impressions: - There’s no roller brush, the vacuum relies on suction to suck up dirt and debris from the floor, with the help of two side brushes. - Surprisingly, I cleaned the dustbin, and it does pick up its fair share of small debris despite not having a roller brush. - We tried it on carpet, and unfortunately it was not so great at picking up hair. So far, acceptable for a budget robot vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Best Robot Vacuum for the money,"I have had several robot vacuums over the years. They typically perform well enough to keep the pet hair in check but I still have to go back and mop every weekend. It was a real pleasure to discover that there is an all-in-one robot vacuum that will perform both functions. The mop is not for heavy duty cleaning like big spills or stains, you will still need some elbow grease to deal with those, but for small spills that dry and leave rings, spots, etc. It's perfect. The rotating brushes are superior to both the robot vacuums I've owned before and instead of a roller in the center, which always gets bound up with pet hair and carpet fibers, it has a port that sucks up the material into the detachable bin. This is a superior design for people who have hardwood floors and low pile carpets like area rugs around different areas of the house. You can't go wrong with this model at this price point.","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Great robot cleaner that both vacuums and mops,"We were looking for an additional robot vac cleaner since our original cleaner got dedicated to our craft room over the garage. Our original robot cleaner was a ROPVACNIC and we were pleased the way it vacuumed the floors, both carpet and LVP. So, we were happy to find out that they came out with a robotic cleaner that vacuums and mops. This robotic cleaner is awesome. In addition to mopping this new model has new features such as being able to control the vacuum suction and has a longer battery life. It comes with a remote or you can download an app and control the robot from your phone. Both are easy to use. The vacuum suction is more powerful on this model and my carpets look great picking up more dirt that I expected. The best part is the mop feature! Not only does it mop but it saves my back! I have a bad back and mopping the kitchen floor was always a chore. My kitchen floor looks great, so this is definitely a game changer for me. I am very pleased the results on both the carpet and tile/LVP floors. This is a great robotic cleaner and you can't beat it for the price.","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2024"

Though it did take a while to clean the room, it did a great job cleaning it. I haven't set it up with the app, so I don't j know if that's why it didn't map the room. Once I do this, I will update my review. I couldn't get it to avoid my carpet, though I kind of rolled it up so it wouldn't go thru it. Other than that, I'm very satisfied.

B0D2XXSPCR,5,Impressive!!!,"I have to admit that I was skeptical at first. I couldn't conceive how it could mop and vacuum but it does. I have always been afraid to have one because I am handicapped and I feared it would go under the bed, out of my reach. With the app and/or remote I don't have to worry about that.

B0D2XXSPCR,5,It's worth the price.,"I recently upgraded to the Tipdiy Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo, and overall, it’s been a solid addition to my cleaning routine. I live in about a 900 sq ft condo with two cats, so hair and debris are a constant challenge. The vacuum does a great job of picking up cat fur, dust, and dirt, which is a relief considering how much shedding my cats do. One thing to note is that it’s slower than its previous model. While it does a good job covering the area, it takes a bit more time to finish cleaning than my old robot vacuum. I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about this at first, but I’ve come to appreciate the trade-off because the battery life has significantly improved. It runs longer now, which means I can set it to clean and not worry about it running out of juice halfway through my condo. The mop function is also a nice touch. It doesn’t replace a deep clean, but for regular upkeep, it does a good job of handling spills and light messes, especially with the cats around. It’s easy to set up, and I love that it can switch between vacuuming and mopping automatically. Overall, while the slower pace is noticeable, the longer runtime and improved cleaning performance make up for it. If you have pets and a medium-sized space like mine then it is a solid choice for daily maintenance.","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024"
B0D2XXSPCR,5,Robot Vacuum with Very Useful features,"My primary reason for purchasing a robot vacuum cleaner is to control the accumulation of pet hair and dust on the floor, particularly under the table and against walls. While running the vacuum at least every other day, I can do other tasks. I am very pleased with the purchase, and the vacuum helps me to meet the pet hair control objective. The positives for this product are: *Front loading water tank and filter assembly *Changes course when encountering obstacles *Good suction of pet hairs *Different cleaning modes to apply to a variety of cleaning scenarios *Mopping function helps remove dust and very light stains *Lightweight and low noise level *Reasonably priced Cons: *The instruction booklet doesn't explicitly state how to use the mopping or spot cleaning modes *Frequent emptying of dust tank is necessary *Not programed to detect areas of very low clearance Overall, I am very satisfied with this robot vacuum. The available functions/modes are very useful for my objectives (keeping a large open area from accumulating significant pet hairs and loose dirt/dust). An example of a useful mode is in the spot cleaning mode. If there is a specific area with dirt or hairs, the vacuum can be quickly placed there for the spot cleaning mode. Then, the auto mode can be resumed. The mopping mode comes in handy to remove fine dust that is commonly tracked onto the floor (see wet streak in the video). These uses can free up time to concurrently do other tasks around the house. Finally, the vacuum is reasonably priced for the features available.","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024"
