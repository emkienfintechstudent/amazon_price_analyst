2,Leaves Stuff Behind: Does Not Clean Edges,"Play Video Jeepers... to say I am disappointed is an understatement. Shark service was great... but I know this is ultimately either a design issue, or the min-brushes which are supposed to sweep items into the roller are not to specification. Neither a good way to start. (LOVE their vacuums, however) As you can see from the photos, the cleaning rollers are smaller that the diameter of the unit. However the overlap is generally quite good. Having said that tho... it means it runs a lot longer and the battery does not last for a full house cleaning, or even the 2 hours it says it should. It is supposed to go recharge itself (I didn't pay attention if it did or not) but when I ran it the 1st time today, it did not do the whole house; missing rooms it had mapped out just the night before.. It did find its way back to the charging station.

The serious issue is that the mapping feature and/or laser-eye seems to stop the unit from hugging the molding. This, coupled with the brushes not extending to the widest sides of the unit (beyond the wheels) means that the edges of the carper do not get cleaned! Given this is designed/marketing for if you have a pet, we know this is a big deal.

My much older, Roomba i-Robot does a great job of edges and corners. (refer photos) It, however, will just die someplace if it runs out of battery as it doesn't know where the station is unless somewhere near it.

The brushes on the Roomba are longer, stiffer, and have a support 'tube' keeping them engaged much better. AND there are 3. Shark has only 1, and after the mapping and 1/2 cleaning the one already took a set.

The Roomba brushes have a yellow base. You can see they extend well beyond the wheels. The Shark's have a black base. Unless the brushes are beyond the unit's edge, it cannot clean the below the molding. The Shark leaves at least a 1/2 - 3/4 inch gap that is not cleaned. The Roomba is pretty much 'snug'.

Both the Roomba and Shark run in a single direction, yet the Roomba brushes still stick out straight have LOTS of cleaning trips.

OH WOW. While writing this the Shark was recharged and seems to be completing the rest of the cleaning tho it is more than 2 1/2 hours later and not necessarily a convenient time.

Shark is sending me new brushes in case the length of the brushes are shorter than the spec calls for. If not, it will have to go back as it is not at all able to do what it is supposed to.

Relative to the Roomba (which is around 4 years old) the Shark IS quieter and it's very nice to have it empty itself, versus every time I ran/run the Roomba. BUT.. the Shark left bits of lint or paper on two different rugs. They were not stuck-in and should have been picked up. (refer the photo of the rust and black geometric rug) Hence it does not clean nearly as well as the Roomba even with a well-used rubber-brush and regular brush. Meaning the Roomba has two; not the single one as in the Shark.

The mapping was less than spectacular. The 1st time it got into some sort of a do-loop and kept mapping a corner of the living room behind a chair. It needed to be recharged and I had to delete the map and start over. As this is an hour job (not the 30 - 45 they say unless you live in an 800 sq ft bungalow) So it was an inconvenience tho not a show stopper.

I always pick up small stuff (pails under my office desk, foot rests, rugs with long fringe). I don't pick up 4-legged chairs or office chairs. The Roomba seems to just figure its way around them after circling the legs 360 degrees. The Shark seems to bounce off them and not always come back. These chairs were taken off the floor during the 'map'. And in any event, even if they had been left in place, they would not be in the exact same place each time. So the programming should be able to handle it.

(Just went to check on the Shark..... it IS in fact noodling thru the rooms it did not do prior.. So its okay.
I just wish the battery were lasting longer.)

For while today I ran both. brands It was pretty funny when off-video they ran into each other. I feel a bit sorry for the Roomba. Older, a bit dustier, noisier and fighting for its vacuum-cleaning life. (lol). But it does a better job, truth be told.

I'll give the Shark a 2nd chance when the brushes arrive. If it solves the 'edge cleaning' and middle-room cleaning, I'll keep it. But speaking of brushes, I hate that it takes a special tool to get them on/off... something I didn't realize when I threw the tool that came with it. I have a bi-zillion Allen Wrenches and Phillips Screwdrivers, even of the same size. But it seems to be a Star-wrench(?). So I can't put the Roomba brushes on (and which look like would fit!). Hopefully the new brushes will come with the tool.

Okay. So my thoughts? It needs to work better once the brushes go in, else it will have to go back as is does NOT clean well, and especially not pet hair since, as those of us with pets know, the fur congregates in the corners and up against the walls."
2,"Overly aggressive on furniture, ignores no-go zones, schedule cleaning very basic, good suction","I purchased this for a Black Friday deal and my unit is now getting close to 5 months old. I've used it almost daily since it arrived. I have a long-haired cat and my home floor area is 2500+ square feet, so it's on the larger side. I never intended for it to vacuum everything, so the base station is in the center living room which in theory should give it the best access to high traffic areas like the kitchen but not necessarily the bathrooms or extra bedroom/office. My entire home is tile so it doesn't need to worry about cleaning on carpets.
I also have a 3 year old $100 Eufy unit that is ""dumb"" non-mapping type for comparison.

Starting with pros:
-Suction power is great. It cleans up a lot of dirt and especially cat hair well.
-Self-emptying is loud but works well and doesn't need to be touched except once a month or so (to clean filters too)
-It will detect when full, empty, then resume cleaning if it still has battery. Battery life also seems excellent

Cons, and these are some major ones.
-It is EXTREMELY aggressive. To the point where it has damaged some of my furniture. As it nears a table leg or similar, it will ""bump"" it to get close to clean, just like my Eufy. The difference is the Eufy bumps then immediately moves around the obstruction. The Shark bumps, then tries to see just how close it can get by ramping itself up the side of the table leg, especially if you have furniture where the legs curve or go outward at the bottom. The Shark thinks it is a mountain climber and tries to go right up the leg of the table, resulting in damage to the finish. Very frustrating - pictured.

-Because of this aggressiveness, it also moves around rugs/mats anything that isn't nailed down, especially if it's higher pile. It seems to do ok on my entry rug but my kitchen has two of those squishier ergonomic pads in front of the sink and stove and after it runs, I find them pushed to a corner or out of place (but only sometimes). Even things with rubber bottoms get moved around - I only mention this because again, the Eufy does not have this problem.

-It mapped my entire home, and I can define rooms like ""Master"" ""Living"" ""Kitchen"" etc but you cannot schedule those rooms. Ex. If I wanted to have the vacuum run every day, but each day clean a different room, you can't do that. You can manually tell it to go to a room, but if you schedule it to run it'll do the default entire-house clean. This is a problem because of how long it takes to clean an area - more on that in a moment.

-In addition to that, you can define no-go zones in the app, which it completely ignores. It will run over your tables, pets, play rooms, and maybe even worse, go into rooms that aren't mapped at all and wreck up the place. After being frustrated with it ignoring no-go zones, I closed my office door and main bedroom doors, remapped the entire house, and set it up from scratch, and as an extra layer, I defined a no-go zone near those doors. If I leave the door open, even though the room isn't on the map, this vacuum will go into the room anyway, ignoring the map and the zones. So what's the point of floor mapping and no-go zones if it's just going to go wherever it wants?

-Maybe I'm not an expert here but the way it cleans is also strange. If you have a long hallway, instead of going up and down the hallway in 4 or 5 trips long-ways (like you would with a normal vacuum), it goes laterally across the hall about 500 times. Because of this, and two hallways in my house, it estimates some absurd amount of time to clean my home, like 5 hours or something. I had to disable the recharge+resume feature because if I set it to start at 10am for example, the thing is still cleaning my house at 5 or 6pm when get back from work because it had to stop and recharge for an hour or so!

-It is years newer than my Eufy but already has a problem with one of the side brushes used to pull dirt into the roller. The brushes on the shark are just a single blade, as opposed to me cheaper Eufy which has 3-bladed brushes. Because of this, it now leaves the dock and gives me an error code. Luckily the code lets me know which part has the problem, so I cleaned and partially disassembled the brushes to make sure there was nothing causing a problem, they spin freely by hand. The unit will spin them a few times but then I get an error and because the side brush has a code, it won't vacuum or do anything at all right now. Even with a broken brush, I still need to vacuum, but I can't override it, so now I'm chasing a warranty/repair claim while my old reliable Eufy takes over.

Conclusion.
Maybe I'm being unfair, and maybe my Eufy isn't working as well as I think, but when I empty both vacuums my non-mapping Eufy seems to have close to as much dirt as the Shark and doesn't have any of the above issues, just the limitation that it doesn't map. But this Shark, even though it maps, it doesn't make good use that mapping information.

The self emptying function is cool even if the mapping is more of a joke than a feature, and perhaps with software/firmware updates, the mapping will improve - the actual hardware of the unit itself seems solid, it's just software issues holding it back."
2,Fascinating and helpful but some serious issues,"2/13/24 Still helpful but there are some extremely frustrating defects in the app. I've now how to re-map the house 5 times which is silly. If the unit disconnects from Wifi you cannot reset the Wifi connection without creating a ""new"" robot and then completely re-mapping the house. Tech support has been helpful but they can't change what the programmers neglected. You should be able easily reconnect to the wifi after a power outage or network change without going through the whole process of creating a ""new"" robot, connecting to wifi again and them remapping the house. Credentials could be easily stored and then reassigned.
NEXT Problem. The first unit died after a power outage. We were out of town but I got a notice that my unity could not find the dock. Got home, tried to reset the unit, got tech on the phone and it ended up they sent me a new robot (without battery, brush and cartridge). Had to remap again. Is this going to happen after every power outage?

12/16/23 Purchased Model AV251WAXUS. Having grown up on The Jetson's cartoon as a kid in the 60s I can say I've been waiting for this... It's no Rosie the Robot maid but it's almost as fun to watch. The Good - it mostly does what it says it will. I'm very impressed with the mapping of the house which is 3300sqft. It does a relatively quick job of figuring out the overall layout. The app allowed us to outline and ID individual rooms - we setup 12 rooms. A couple are combined. Rosie (you can name the thing) can be dispatched to clean one or several rooms at a time, or the whole house. We are pretty pleased with the amount of ""stuff"" we dumped after each run as we ran some initial tests...

The Bad: The app says you can add rooms. Since the instructions are very brief and not entirely clear, we understood that to mean we could do the initial mapping for a section of the house and then add rooms later. Not exactly. You need to do the whole house first and then if you want to split (add?) rooms you apparently can later. As a result we had to delete the first map and run a whole new initial map of the house. So instructions should be more clear. You cannot setup two maps, say one for upstairs, one for down, or in our case a sunken living room. To do the living room we have to carry Rosie to the room and manually press clean - since it doesn't already have the map it trys to outline the room and then cover as best it can. We then set the unit on the main floor and press dock and let it try to find its way home.

The Okay: Again, this is no Rosie the Robot but it is useful and I'd say worth it. It gets the lighter stuff that is not wedged or otherwise sticking to carpet or floor. It get's full and even after evacuating at the dock, it can have a chunck stuck that reduces suction. The ""Evacuate and Return"" feature is helpful for this. We still have to get the edges with a normal or shop vac and it sometimes will not follow a straight wall the full length - it sometimes moves away from the wall and then back to it skipping some space like it's avoiding something... Returning to the dock is interesting. After very accurately mapping the house and the furniture/obstacles it makes a left turn into our laundry room before entering room where the dock is. It can take 10 minutes scooting around things before figuring out how get to the door 5 ft away. It always makes it home but it's an adventure. As someone who likes tech and has some ability to understand the workings, this is very amusing AND we believe will help us keep the house clean.."
2,A disappointment after 6 weeks,"I reviewed these style of robot vacuums, wanting one that was good at collecting pet hair (cats), had a dock that would allow it to empty itself, and had a good reputation with mapping and maintenance. After reading other peoples reviews I settled on this one balancing cost vs. quality. After having this device for 6 weeks, I find myself regretting the purchase.

1 - Cat hair - it does a fine job on hard flooring, exceptional really based off how quickly the storage on the base fills. It is weak at collecting the pet hair from carpet. It picks up some pet hair off the carpet, but leaves rolled up lines of pet hair, enough to be noticeable after each pass.

2 - Base that it can empty the robot - Works as described.

3 - Mapping - The device app says that mapping will adjust and improve over time, but so far I have not been able to see that. I've had to delete the map as being insufficient after every two weeks. Between missing sections of rooms or even entire rooms, and never updating from the original map. One of the problems is the battery being unable to reach the entire area in one run, so areas are missed and the map never seems to change.

While I was glad to see the device able to dock itself when the battery ran low, I guess I assumed that after recharging it would venture out to finish the job. It does not do that, once the battery has run low, the robot docks and waits until it's next scheduled run to start over. According to the company website/trouble shooting it starts in a different area and runs a different pattern. While that may be true, it has missed my dining room at least 70% of the time.

OTHER PROBLEMS NOTED -

The App - The app does not keep you signed in, requiring you to sign in every few days. Even worse, it makes you enter you email each time when you need to sign in. Its annoying and inconvenient. This doesn't access my bank, or photos, or anything security wise. Why do I have to sign in so frequently.

The App - The mapping section allows you to name individual areas/rooms, set up a schedule for cleaning or even elect areas to not clean. If the vacuum isn't able to clean the entire floor in one run, then you should be able to assign areas with a priority. I don't know about other peoples homes, but I personally want the vacuum to hit the dining room any time it runs, but I found it being a distance from the base meant that 50% of the time it wasn't cleaned. One of the annoying things I experienced was the App would not let you move on from the map after the first mapping until you accepted it.

The App (Schedule) - You can schedule the robot to run on particular days of the week at what ever time you wish. That is just a blanket ""clean"" of the entire map. I think if it isn't able to do the entire area in one run and isn't going to finish after recharge, they should add the option to schedule specific rooms or areas. Then you could have it clean the dining room each evening, while hitting the less important rooms (laundry room, bathroom, etc.) once or twice a week.

Perhaps having a 'mapping mode' where the robot just maps the areas without cleaning, just finding its way and outer borders without having to cross every square inch of each room.

I have experience several episodes of the device saying it was stuck, asking to be moved to a flat spot while sitting on the dock.

Unexpected issue - A minor issue but worth mentioning. The power button on the robot is along it's side, at a perfect height for the robot to accidently turn into a door stop and turn itself off. This has only happened once so far but wanted to mention it. Perhaps putting the power switch on top would be a better choice.

I will continue to work with this robot, but I can honestly say I would not buy it again."
2,Too many error messages.,"This vacuum has proven to be more troublesome than I thought it would be. Set up is fairly easy, but trying to get it to vacuum where you want it to and when you want to proves to be problematic. If you were to watch it perform you would think that it was confused: spinning in circles, constantly bumping into the same object and sending out too many error messages. The final straw was when I propped it to clean it tells me it needs to be moved to a level surface. Mind you this is the same level surface that it has been on since the purchase and has left the dock just fine. There have been a few instances where I receive an error message that says “I’m stuck please move me to a different area.” Other error messages are “my battery power is at 5%. Please move me to the dock“. The most interesting error message was that it felt that it was near a cliff where there was no cliff. It does take an extra effort to prepare the home for continuous vacuum use, so shoes, wires toys, etc.. All need to be removed from the ground. It will climb over some thin wiring, for example, the power cord to a reclining chair but there was one instance when it did so it pulled the power source out of the wall outlet. If you have seasonal decorations on the floor (as my wife does for every season) that are fairly lightweight, you will find they get pushed around, forcing you to return those items to their original places. Bottom line is that it is more trouble than it’s worth, forcing you to follow it around to make sure that it’s not stuck or running out of power or pushing things around the house. I’m returning it!"
2,Dumbest Robot Vacuum in the World,"This vacuum needs some serious software work. Mechanically, the robot does a pretty solid job despite having single brushes to gather, but main brush is good, the three suction modes are great, and it cleans pretty well. The drive system is actually VERY impressive, and this thing crawls over deep throw rugs easily, and unfortunately it crawls over power cords, loose clothing, pet toys, most anything under an inch tall and it jams itself up. Not a big deal, keep the junk off the floor and it's great. The self-emptying feature works very well, but on occasion the self-empty door on the robot will get caught with a hairball or a chunk of something. Still, very powerful, very nice to only have to empty it once every few days. The Android app couldn't find the vacuum right out of the box, but the iPhone app picked it right up and registered it. Again, not a big deal because I had both, but could cause some people issues. The schedule is nice, might be nicer if you could schedule more than one time per day and/or schedule rooms individually, but whole-house one time a day is sufficient. I used the no-go strips but somehow the vacuum always got over/around them. The Shark Clean app is pretty nice and the idea of the house being mapped out and being able to build and name rooms and build no-go areas is great in concept, but it just flat doesn't work. This vacuum is supposed to map the house, establish cleaning patterns, and even empty itself and return to the pattern where it left off, but when you watch it operate, the thing is just completely retarded. As it takes off, it tends to clean the area around the base most frequently but the pattern is neither regular nor random. It attempts to run parallel to walls, but after a while you see that it varies by up to ten degrees. It still runs parallel to its own tracks and cleans OK, just odd. When it needs to empty, it returns to the dock via weird routes, multiple stops and course adjustments, sometimes sitting in one place and spinning 270 or 360 degrees several times before it blunders back to the dock, where it takes several approaches to dock and empty. When it tries to return to the pattern, an equally drunken and confused behavior gets it back there, after wasting considerable battery and time, and resumes. There are times it will miss entire rooms yet there are times it cleans the same room repetitively until returning to the dock. The cliff sensors tend to shut the unit down if it goes over a heat register or transitions to a dark surface from a light one. When checking the Shark Clean app, the ""home"" circle that represents the dock tends to move around, sometimes even into no-go zones and then the unit won't run at all, it just sits on the dock confused or can't return to the dock and just sits until it's dead. It took me three map rebuilds to realize that I had been trying to run it at night and the robot relies on the camera on top to view and memorize the ceiling, so it couldn't map or clean effectively when the rooms were dark. Working from home, having this thing rumble and bumble around during working hours is annoying, but using it after dark is completely fruitless. All in all, it hasn't been worth even the deeply-discounted price I paid for it, and it is far less effective than a ""dumb"" Roomba that's a quarter of the cost that just wanders randomly and doesn't empty itself. Very disappointed, going to run it until it dies and look at a Samsung or iRobot or something else that's smarter."
2,Fell apart after 1 year,"This robot vacuum was the answer to all my dreams, for the first 12 months. It cleaned well, even though it would get stuck a decent amount, that never really bothered me. My favorite aspect was the Spot clean option that you could control from the app. It was spectacular and so easy to use. I never had an issue with the app communicating to the device. BUT THEN one day I started getting the Cliff Sensor Error (Code 7) and have never been able to get past it. I cleaned the sensors, with every possible solution. Nothing. I have tried to reset the robot. Nothing. I have tried to override the sensors by covering them up. Nothing. The robot will not budge because it thinks it is on a ""cliff."" While trying to troubleshoot I realized the black strip on the front as coming up, after trying to fix that, the entire thing just came off, and all the plastic brackets broke off as well. I am actually so sad, I loved this robot until now."
2,A glitch in the Matrix,"Buggy software. Once, it decided to vacuum at 2:30am, waking up the entire family. Today, it cleaned 2 square feet and returned to base, despite being asked to vacuum several rooms (see photo). After mapping your whole house, if you move some furniture there's no way to re-map just one room -- you have to re-map the whole house, which means picking up EVERYTHING first. Cleaning performance is decent, but it lacks the air puff feature to get dust out of corners. The rotating brushes get snagged on even medium area rugs, had to buy replacements. If you have a shag area rug, you can exclude it on the map by dragging and pinching, but it's impossible to get the region exactly right so you'll have a foot around the rug which never gets cleaned, or the vacuum tries to clean the edge of the rug and gets snagged. Finally, Shark plays games with pricing, and the 50% off price is the rule not the exception. Worth it at 299, but there are better options."
2,Decent hardware ruined by half baked software - I'll update if they ever fix it,"We've had this robot for about a year and a half and put it through it's paces. First the good: the dust bin works as you'd expect most of the time and has the advantage of not requiring bags like the irobot version does. This is definitely a step up over needing to empty it every run. The only issue is that there is a permanent filter in the robot's bin in addition to the hepa filter that tends to get clogged up and requires some manual intervention now and again for dust buildup. Larger particles it picks up can get caught in the door of the dustbin and require you to clear it before it can run again or finish emptying the bin. It does a better job on dust and small particles than the older generation roombas, but I haven't compared to something like the i7+.

Now the bad:
-It built a map once after 6 months that looked nothing like my home. Reset it and it has never built one again, so don't buy it for the smart mapping filter it is a sales lie.
-The algorithm for getting unstuck is terrible. It will regularly go over something then try to back up and give up registering the ""I'm stuck"" or ""cliff sensor"" under cabinets or over thresholds. This could definitely be fixed in software by making it either more conservative of where it goes forward or more aggressive when trying to get unstuck.
-The thing stays connected to wifi all the time, so if it doesn't make it back to the dock it will drain from 100% battery to 0% in a matter of a few hours. This is poor software power management - anyone dealing with embedded devices could fix this so that it only checks in on the radio and puts it in a sleep mode and dials back the power to the minimum required to maintain connectivity. No need for a 500Mbps wifi connection to send ""start, stop"" signals...
-Everytime it registers on the dock it tries to empty the bin, so if you find it late at night and there are kids in the house sleeping you can't put it on the bin to charge. A simple software setting for silent mode or night mode or something would solve this
-It doesn't retain the vacuum strength setting. If you put it on max the next run it is back to normal. If I say max clean want it to CLEAN! I don't care if it is loud.
-When it has an error you must press clean twice. Once to clear the error and again to restart it. Why? Just clear the error and try cleaning again in one step. This sounds petty but it is super annoying.
-The clean algorithm could use improvement. It definitely misses some spots even after multiple runs. This could be as simple as adding in a random/dumb mode and doing a run that way manually or as a final pass or first pass
-Virtual walls are primitive. Who wants magnetic strips all over the house? You have a device with as many sensors as a mars rover in it. How about a joystick mode that allows the user to drive the outline of the room and mark borders/edges and room divisions. This would help solve the mapping problem and make it way less likely to get stuck.
-The software will randomly die and the on off switch must be toggled to reboot it maybe once every month or two.
-I've never seen anything that indicates a software update was sent which means they don't appear to be adding any fixes or value. This thing is wifi connected. In the age of teslas and internet connected fridges how about fixing some of these ridiculously simple problems over the air and making it 10x better."
2,Update after regular use,"Original review below, but I've had it for a short while now and I must admit buyers remorse. I'll be saving up to replace this with a roomba.

This vacuum does the wrong thing over half the time, i.e. I tell it to clean the kitchen floor and it does 3 other rooms randomly without ever going into the kitchen. And it will go over a carpet 3 times and still leave crumbs behind. It cannot get edges at all and takes forever to charge. This was a true waste of money. Don't waste yours like I wasted mine. 😑

.....

Overall I'm quite satisfied. I tend to like Shark brand vacuums so when my Roomba finally died after many years of awesome cleaning I thought I'd try this. Here are the main differences between the two:

Shark runs quieter than my old Roomba.

They both hit all the rooms without issues.

Roomba mapping in the app is better for more precise control of the room dividers.

This guy is missing the front spinning brushes my Roomba had which definitely leaves much to be desired in edge cleaning along my kitchen cabinets.

Not having to buy vacuum bags is great.

Shark cleans the room quicker with no obvious difference in the amount of pet hair and debris picked up.

Roomba recharged faster but Shark seems to be able to clean more rooms on a single charge.

Will I buy another Shark when this guy dies? Probably, but I'll look for a model with edging brushes."
2,Disappointed but think it is still nice!,"Ordered this vacuum as it had good reviews and at a good price; however, I found that it wasn't very functual for us in rural Arkansas with slow internet. We only get about 10 gbs and I think this may have been part of our problems. We also have frequent power outages which required it to be rebooted to our router. It was very slow to connect with our router and it was fully charged at this time. After finally getting it connected, I let it totally map our small house of app. 1200 sq. Ft. The first few days it worked pretty well on normal power setting. Then a brief power outage required a new internet connection. This time, using the app on my phone, I asked it to vacuum only half the house. It became totally lost and really didn't do much of anything. Sent it back to dock and had to clear the old map of our house and let it remap the area again. It would do pretty well on whole house setting, although it would miss a room most times. Eventually it would get totally lost and I would hit return to dock and my phone app showed it to be docking, which it never did. I found myself spending way more time preparing the area for it to work, and then finding it getting lost and doing one area over and over....bottom line I have become very frustrated with it and the time it takes to run it, not to mention maintaining keeping the dust ben, filters, rollers, etc. clean. Staying with my old vac. Maybe it is great with decent internet. My brother lives in a city with strong internet and loves his. Truly seems like a great machine and I'm sure most customers will really enjoy it!"
2,Dissapointed.,"I had high hopes for this little robot vacuum as Shark is a reputable brand. Unfortunately, this little guy misses the mark by a long shot. This was purchased as a replacement for my Roomba i6+ when it met its unfortunate demise by way of a pile of dog poo courtesy of my Anatolian Shepherd. After ripping out the old, poo-covered carpet and replacing it with LVP flooring I was hesitant about getting another robot vacuum. I looked at many over the course of a few months weighing my options carefully. I was excited to get this one on a Black Friday deal, especially with its 4+ star average rating over 25k reviews. It must be great, right? Not quite, I'll probably be returning it, and here is why:
#1) Mapping. I've tried everything I could possibly think of and this thing can't seem to map my house. It gets about 900sqft of my 1200sqft home. My Roomba mapped everything flawlessly on the first run.
#2) Noise. This little guy may look sleek, but my goodness is it loud! I thought maybe it just needed to break in a little bit, but after 3 days and 12 runs, it still sounds like a mini diesel truck regardless of if it's on carpet or hardwood or laminate.
#3) Main brush. The Anatolian Shepherd I mentioned earlier produces a lot of hair. I also have a wooly-coat Siberian Husky German Shepherd mix so you can probably imagine the hair situation between the two. My Roomba had those silicone brushes. Sure, I had to disassemble and clean the hair out of the bits about once a week, but that's to be expected. The brush on this thing is just lines of bristles and some weird little fabric flap that seems totally useless. Over the last three days, I've had to cut the hair out at least 10-12 times and you can't easily disassemble it to take the brush roller out and make sure it's totally clear without dealing with those little tiny nightmare screws that never fail to get lost.
#4) Navigation. Why is there no perimeter clean? Why? This thing seems to go in whatever direction with no real rhyme or reason. I'm assuming this is why it won't map the house.
#5) Cleaning ability. Forget about getting any debris between your floor vents and the wall. It won't go over the floor vents. It won't stay close enough to the walls for its pathetic little single-armed side brushes to actually scoot stuff into the main brush's path for pickup. It sucks at going around corners. The suction power is meh, even ""max"" suction is questionable - but I do like that you can adjust the suction power (that may be the only good thing about it).

Not impressed. Get a Roomba, just don't forget to open the doggy door."
2,Poor Rosie lost her wifi,"We upgraded our Wi-Fi to a new router so I needed to get Rosie on to the new wi-fi. Unfortunately Rosie can't find the Wi-Fi. Pressing the clean and dock buttons does nothing, it will not connect. Call customer service and walk through several different attempts to connect. Unfortunately, it appears the Wi-Fi is dead. My father-in-law had a shark vacuum that did the same thing and they replaced the unit because it was a known issue. Unfortunately mine is a different model and the best they could do was offer to sell me a new one for $220. Agent said that they used to send out the computer boards but they don't have those available anymore. So I've had this robot since the end of November of 2022. And honestly I started having issues with her connecting last year but I've just been too busy to deal with it. I can still manually push the clean button and it'll go back and forth but no more scheduling and I can't tell it to clean a particular room.

I did get her on sale for $300. But I think it's ridiculous that a robot that retails for $400 will only last a year. Shark needs to do better job of supporting their customers and having parts available to make repairs.
I did not buy the extended warranty as I thought my credit card offered that and just found out they discontinued the program due to lack of use.

Did it clean? I have mostly hard floors and it did ok. On carpet it did pick up quite a bit. I was actually surprised. The programming and AI was pretty good although I noticed several months ago that it started getting stuck in odd places that it shouldn't get stuck at. It was an obvious software issue, not hardware.

Would I buy a shark again? Probably not. I was impressed with the way they handled my father-in-law's issue, but I'm very unimpressed with how they've handled mine."
2,"For the price, you would think it would work better","I’ve had this thing for a few months now. I previously had a roomba that crapped out after a couple of years and wanted to see if this would work better. In comparison with the roomba, this thing has way more trouble getting over the floor vents and over doorways. I have to manually move it to different parts of the house because it can’t make it everywhere on its own. I have three dogs and so this thing has gotten pretty heavy use over the past few months. At first I thought the sucking power was pretty strong, but I’m watching it right now on my rug going over debris that one would think it could easily pick up and it’s not sucking up anything. Pretty frustrating given the price."
2,Was great... WHEN IT WORKED.,"I bought this on a Prime Day deal because I couldn't pass up the $500 vacuum that does everything on it's own for almost $150 off! Having a 2 cat household that often filled up my old dust cup super fast and being always on the go with work (leaving the old auto-vacuum not able to run) I was SO excited to have a solution for that ""full dust cup"" issue. I could program the Shark to run however often and just dump the ""tower"" chamber every couple weeks. Woohoo!
Programming was easy peazy. It cleaned well (picking up kitty litter and plenty of fur), navigated the rooms systematically (no zig zags missing spots) so my OCD was happy and all was well.... Until the ""dust cup"" error went off every other time. Despite it being clean. I got that figured out to where it only happened on occasion and life was good for another 6ish months. This week the Shark has now stopped working altogether with ""Error 6, Bumper is stuck"" as the reason every time it's set to clean. I called Shark for tech support, went through the usual turn off, turn on, check that the bumper moves (all the things I'd tried prior to calling & bumper moved as it should be)-- but still the error. They then told me ""at this point normally we would correct this under warranty, however you're outside the warranty window"" (1 yr window... Shark was purchased not even a full 16 months ago). I asked if I was understanding him correctly that they sell a $500 vacuum that is ONLY covered for 1 year and if it breaks under normal, regular use that it is marketed for, it's not covered, sorry you have to buy a new vacuum. He replied with ""I can offer you 30% off the same model if you want to buy from us now""... (uhm, again, you want to sell me another $500 vacuum, that will ONLY last a little over a year, but for the bargain price of $350 +taxes, s/h? No thanks). Him: ""I'm very sorry about your trouble."" Me: I'm very sorry for your company's loss in clientele.
I DID purchase a 3YR protection plan that was offered with the vacuum when I bought it, just in case-- but when I tried to file a claim they denied me because the coverage amount purchased did not match the value of the product (why was it offered if it's not the correct value?). They refunded me the amount of protection plan and directed me to Amazon. THANKFULLY after speaking to a supervisor at Amazon, I was able to get a replacement vacuum... but will never get the 3 hours of my life from dealing with this back.

In all: Kudos to Amazon for fixing the problem (4 stars), Warning to everyone to check the value of protection plans before you purchase (2 stars) and a heads up about Shark's product & customer service (1 star). If I hadn't already purchased and was getting a replacement, I WOULD NOT buy again. & most likely won't buy any Shark products after this."
2,Updated 6/2022 and 2/2023 Good? NOPE,"Tried two different models of Shark and this one being the most expensive at almost $400!! In numerous attempts to get this thing to learn our home (3600 sf) but once the map is ‘ready’ and I choose to clean one room, it invariably goes the wrong direction or does a different room. Tried calling Shark customer service only to be told to delete the map and start over. Additionally, no matter how much charge is left, after one hour it will return to the base and says it needs to charge. So many flukes with this that I think it’s not worth the money. I start cleaning at 8 am and after MANY returns to the base, it almost finishes the house by 10 pm!!! Ridiculous waste of my time and electricity. I can typically vacuum this house in an hour to an hour and a half.

Updated 6/2022: After using this since the purchase in Dec 2021, this little vacuum and I have a like/hate relationship. It’s mapping is still totally wacky. I tell it to do a certain room at the back of the house and it goes in the opposite direction. I send it back to the dock, let it rest for 5 min and then tell it to clean that same room. This time it goes and does five or six passes like it’s trying to remember where I sent it but after 2-3 tries (and all the while using more battery) it sort of figured it out. I have much more luck if I select three rooms because eventually it does at least two. It’s driving me mad. Customer support is overseas and I’m told each time to delete the map and start over. Frustrating. I was told this thing would get better each time but it’s not. Now I know why I see people go through these so fast. I paid $450 for this and it’s just crap. The last call to Customer Service, I was told that these are meant for 2000 sf or LESS. They suggested I buy two and put them on opposite sides of my 3000 sf home. Sure, spend more money. No thanks!

Updated 2/12/23
Still frustrated that we spent SO much on this thing and as of today I have completely removed the robot, removed the app and started from scratch. It started up, looked like it was doing okay but STILL not a smart robot. We have four large connected/open plan rooms (family room, kitchen, dining and breakfast room) and three bedrooms. The robot does a partial area, moves to the next “room” and never returns to complete it. Additionally, it has stopped three times in the first hour to empty and resume and now (even tho I have it set to extended vacuum) it is charging after only have used 40% battery. It’s mind-boggling how much I have invested just today when I could have vacuumed my whole house in an hour or less. I really wish I could return this expensive piece of crap."
2,Does its job but app is trash,"This device works well. Bought it for my elderly parents' living room since they have hairy pets and a rug (worse combination possible) so I needed a device with max power. This does the job and I've scheduled it to clean the house twice a week and its unbelievable! Nevertheless, mapping the house has been a pain and the fact that you can't move the station from the place without having to remap everything again from scratch is horrible. You cant have more than one map either so if you have 2 floors or more in your house bad luck for you! Same can be said for myslef as I wanted to buy another shark model for my own home but cant have it in my phone since I would have to delete my parents map... The device doesn't necesarily respect or follows the map accordingly (I've blocked the bathrooms and kitchen in the app map but it still goes in those areas whenever it feels like it). It does fill up its internal storage quite quickly so be aware of cleaning it in time."
2,Not as good as advertised,"Now that I have had this robot vacuum for three weeks, I feel I can write a fair review of its performance.

When I bought this Sharkbot, I didn't expect it to pick up all the hair on the floor since we have two Collies and an Aussie. I had to vacuum daily with my Kirby in order to keep the hair to a minimum. I knew this would not take the place of a good vacuum cleaner but I was hoping running the Sharkbot daily would allow me to only get out the Kirby once or twice a week, which it has done. However, while it picks up hair on the hardwood floor, it doesn't do a thing on carpeted areas or our area rugs. It won't even pick up paper or lint off of a rug. The suction is quite low, even on the max setting, which I try to not use since it is quite loud. It will pick up 75% of the dirt and items on the hardwood, including pet hair, but that is all it is good for. The instructions indicate cleaning the filters monthly will aid in suction. I clean them every other day and it still doesn't help.

It is advertised to allow voice commands via Alexa and it is supposed to be able to clean any room designated by Alexa. However, the app that is downloaded to your phone indicates this feature is not yet available. The only thing you can tell it to do is either clean or dock itself - that's it. In fact, it is advertised to clean any room you want but will not, either by app or by voice. That is one of the main reasons I bought this unit. I wanted it to clean the family room daily and the rest of the house only periodically. It cannot be done.

It is supposed to hold up to 30 days of dirt in its dock chamber before the need to empty. I guess that is true if you don't count the dog hair. It is supposed to have self cleaning brush roller blades, but that is also false advertising since I have to clean out the hair wrapped around the middle of the roller nearly every day.

It mapped out our house relatively quickly; the instructions said to give it ten days but it had the map complete in only three days. That is the best thing I can say about it because now it gets lost. On three occasions, it trapped itself in a bathroom after pushing the door closed. One time, it took me ten minutes of scouring the entire house before I found it. It doesn't follow instructions given from either the mobile device or by pushing the clean or dock buttons on the unit itself. It simply seems to not know what it is doing, oftentimes going over the same area three or four times. It ignores the dock command most of the time. It ignores the barrier I have set up for it around the dog bowls, jumping the strip that is supposed to stop it.

Overall, I am giving this vacuum a two star rating instead of a one star simply because it does allow me to vacuum with the Kirby less often. But if I had it to do over again, I certainly would not buy this Sharkbot. For the money spent, I should have bought an iRobot."
2,Very Smart- Clogging makes it worthless- keep your box for 30 days- you will need it.,"I migrated from a D10 Neato that was fantastic but required constant roller maintenance and unclogging- because it had amazing battery life and would clean the whole house and jam itself completely full. It has a small holding bin. This unit does an absolutely remarkable job with mapping, and respecting no-go zones, and has fantastic suction power. However, it needs to have a user setting like, ""Return to empty yourself every 15 minutes of vacuuming"" or something, because the pathway for debris is so narrow, it gets jammed after one room of vacuuming up dog hair. I don't have a lot of dog hair overall, but it seems to be unable to handle much of any without jamming itself full. See photos. I even went so far as to exclude carpeted areas to make sure I had no carpet fibers being pulled in.

As you can see from the photos, the brush is not clogged with a paperclip or something, and neither is the dust bin or pathway. The roller does a great job of not picking up long hair and getting itself wrapped all up like my D10 did. However, overall it is completely worthless to me as the cleaning isn't much better than my 5 year old D10, and I still have to follow after it to yank out the dust bin and empty long before it returns to it's base. The photos attached are from AFTER IT WENT BACK TO THE BASE AND THE SUPER NOISEY BASE SUCK PROCESS happened. Yes, that is the state it normally is in (if I don't intervein) when it starts it's next cleaning cycle.

Overall very depressed about it. I thought i would get at least a few days break from manually unclogging my robot, but instead stuck with a product that claims to be fantastic for pet hair, but instead clogs up and ends up not cleaning the house as well as my five year old Neato... which I gave away.

In summary, keep your box if you have pet hair, I suspect you will want to return it. I have reached out to their support, but thus far gotten no response. Not sure what they could do anyway other than sending me a unit that will do a better job, but I will keep you posted and update this review accordingly."
2,Worked great at first! But was was quickly disappointed 😔,"I really liked the quality at first. But not even a month in it started saying “My side brush is stuck error #2”, and would not continue cleaning. I checked the side brushes multiple times following the shark app directions, and there were no blockages. I called Shark a few times and had video calls showing my flawed product. They recognized the flaws and offered to send a replacement. However they stated the replacement will be a different color and NOT include the home base, side brushes, roller brush, or back filter. I would have to save or replace those parts myself. I said ok well thanks that will do I guess, because this thing was expensive and I just bought it! But since I live in Alaska (Which is part of America! Not a foreign Country) they would have to charge me $100 dollars to send it to me, and they don’t send to PO Boxes! I felt that was ridiculous because I had just spent so much on the vacuum already for it to do this within a month, and have to pay another $100 dollars for them to send me a replacement shell of the product. I don’t even know if that will work. So what does that just leave me SOL? The kind lady that was helping saw also how it didn’t make much sense and tried asking the supervisor. Unfortunately that also did not work out in my favor, as the supervisor refused removing the extra fee. I don’t know what to do. I’m very disappointed and saddened and feel like I wasted my money and was taken advantage of."
2,It's died in less than a year and has been less than stellar,"If I hadn't got this on a 50% off sale, I'd be spitting mad right now.

First, if you have a dog that sheds a lot, this is NOT the product for you. I have a yellow lab who sheds badly, and I had to take the roller apart after every cleaning to pull out the backed up piled of compacted hair. The 60 day capacity? Forget it - I had to empty the can after every second cleaning.

The suction on carpet, again with pet hair, isn't great. On hard floors, no complaints at all. Navigated mats without problems, though it did fight with my dog's water bowl (what a mess) and I had to put bowls up during cleaning.

All of this said, I have used the vacuum maybe 20 times tops, in part because my dog is terrified of it, and in part because it's a pain in the rear cleaning the roller and pulling all the wadded up hair out every time. I purchased on December 7, 2023 and as of yesterday (November 10, 2024) all the lights are solid red, and the unit is completely unresponsive despite the app not showing any warnings. I tried to contact Shark using the online chat, it indicated a 17 minute wait, and the sharply disconnected my and told me to call them when they hadn't responded to the chat after 17 minutes. What the heck!

I will call Shark, and if this is resolved (I don't have high hopes), I will come back and update the review. But for right now I'm a very unhappy customer."
2,Waste of Money and Poor Customer Support,"Update: Gave this back a star because when I called Shark Customer Support again and insisted on speaking to a manager, he agreed to waive the shipping fee for a replacement vacuum. The remainder of my one year warranty should cover the replacement vacuum, here's hoping it works better than the first one. I'm already past the time limit on getting a refund through Amazon and Shark will only replace the vacuum, not refund the cost. I have a Shark Navigator Bagless Upright Vacuum that I love and it does great with pet hair (even years later), I was expecting the same kind of performance out of the robot vacuum. We'll see if the second chance pays off in the long run.

I have had this robot vacuum around 5 months now and it winds down fast. Initially, it would pick up pet hair, dirt, and small debris. It would clean my vinyl wood flooring and the area rugs decently enough. Its suction has been steadily decreasing and the pet hair gets tangled in every crevice under the unit (wheels, brush rolls, all the little stationary mini brushes). Now it only halfway picks up debris on the vinyl flooring while dragging around clumps of pet hair and doesn't do anything for the area rugs except drag the pet hair clumps onto them and leave them there. It's also constantly stopping with ""error message 2"" which means it thinks there's something stuck under the unit - which there's not. I've tried manually de-tangling pet hair from anywhere I can find it under the unit, emptying it myself, and even called customer support. The last try was a bad joke. Shark customer support kept putting me on hold (I guess while he Googled solutions), had me switch the two side brushes around (like that made a bit of difference), and then admitted he didn't know what else to do. Didn't even try to address the loss of suction issue, just said it should be the most powerful robot vacuum on the market (riiiight). He told me that since it was still under warranty he could send me a replacement unit - but I'd have to shell out $25 for shipping (because they apparently put that clause in the warranty somewhere - which is what he told me when I asked why I had to pay money when their product was defective).
I know this is a lot cheaper than some other models but it's still a waste of money if it quits working less than 6 months after buying it, especially with how little I used it because I got tired of my floors looking dirty so I went back to vacuuming myself. Which defeats the purpose of having a robot vacuum. I'm hoping Amazon refunds me so I can buy something that actually works like it's supposed to and lasts more than half a year. Imagine how many regular vacuums you could buy for this price that would last you YEARS. Oh and Shark Customer Service won't refund your money, even under warranty, they say Amazon has to do it.
Shark, get your act together. Apologize for your defective products and don't expect your customers to pay extra for you to fix what shouldn't have so easily broken in the first place. We paid for it already, now hold up your end of the deal and deliver what you promised."
2,Not great,"I purchased a Shark robot vac based on friends who have them and love them. This particular model is not great. It doesn’t pick up debris well and often leaves enough behind that I have to spot clean by hand. I have a cheaper model with older technology that cleans far better. This model also has a large disk on top that prevents it from going under furniture, even furniture with risers to increase height. If you have a multi-story home, this model will map only one floor. You can use it on other floors by carrying it to that area and pressing the “clean” button on the machine (rather than using the app), but there is no room mapping if you do it that way. There is also no remote control to direct the vac if it has missed a key spot. You can direct it to spot clean a small area, but that involves returning it to the doc, waiting for it to reset, and then sending it off to a small area. By the time I’ve done that, it would be just as fast to grab my stick vac and spot clean myself. It also does not appear to be pulling a lot of pet hair out of my area rugs. In comparison to my older, cheaper model, it appears to be pulling only a fraction of the pet hair up. Overall I don’t recommend, as my older, cheaper vac performs much better."
2,Not very impressed,"I received this on Monday July22nd and set it up July 23rd.
First I had to have the main brush replaced due to excessive noise. They took care of that with no problem.
Next I did the room explore and setup the rooms. That was easier then I thought it would be.
No here is where the fun begins.
The robot would not go between the love seat and the coffee table, even though there is plenty of room.
Next we get to the dinning room, it won't clean under the chairs or the table. Again, plenty of height and room for it to pass but jsut won't go, so I delete rooms and statrt over.
Same issues , so I try it for the third time and still won't work.
Now I delete for the forth attempt to resolve the problem. Here's what I came up with, move your funiture out of the room and it works like a champ.
It will be going back.
My recommendation is to not buy the Shark products and keep shopping."
2,Vacuums well but the technology advertised doesn’t work,Product cleans and vacuums well but the technology with voice activation and connection to WiFi doesn’t work at all. I tried all the steps advertised to fix the problem with 0 results. I have tried to get another unit or some money off with no help so far. If you don’t mind that it can’t do what it says but cleans good then the 300 is for you. I would try something else. I will change my opinion if I receive the customer service deserved for this large of a problem.
2,"30 days, that is how long it worked","What a great idea. A vacuum that maps out the house, recognizes obstacles and pretty much is supposed to be hands off.
First day, it took a while to charge (or maybe I'm impatient). It mapped out my house after an hour or two. Setting the schedule was easy. A few days in it just didn't start. No idea what happened. Maybe it was full. Apparently you have to go in and turn the notifications on so that it tells you why it doesn't do something.
On the 31st day of owning the robot, I realize that it had not cleaned my house in three days. When I went on there to find out why it said to clean under the ""shark label"". Um, it doesn't come off and there are NO directions like a printer to show you how. After searching online and trying to find any answers on the app I was unable to fix the issue. I ended up returning the item after 33 days of owning it. When it worked it did a decently good job however it does not go under cabinets in the kitchen it's a little too tall so it will throw debris under there with its little whipper sweeps 🤣 Otherwise, it was awesome!
It does not tell you when it's compartment is full and you will have to remember to go check it every couple days or more if you have an animal"
2,It was good for a 14 months.,"I purchased this vacuum in July 2023. Flash forward to September 2024 and the vacuum no longer works at all. It started failing by not following the schedule. Then not only would the vacuum not go off on schedule, but it lost the map of our house. Next, it would only leave the base for 5 minutes then go immediately back to the base. Now, the vacuum doesn’t leave the base at all. My husband attempted a call with IT and that didn’t provide any solutions at all. Would not recommend."
2,"Good item, bad customer service",My household loves the Shark products and we have one for each floor. Our newest unit however will not keep a charge at all. Won’t respond to any attempts to have it leave the docking station. The customer service has been a long and aggravating process. It’s like they don’t believe me even though they have said it’s verified that my unit has no power. The last response of many was the usual “did you try turning it off then on again” bs. Still no resolution. Consider this when buying the product.
2,"WHEN it works, it works","I bought this refurbished and it has only worked maybe 30% of the time I’ve had it since March. It’s been nothing but a nightmare trying to contact the manufacturer for repairs so I’m considering finding a local vacuum repair shop. When it does work, it was significantly better than the cheaper model of a roomba I used to have, bumps into things and gets stuck much less. But it’s still not the best at avoiding things it gets tangled in, and sometimes the stupid little brushes on the bottom get tangled in our shaggy rug. The fibers have been all but torn out from one of those brushes, so we’ll need to replace that when/if we get this working again."
2,Buyer beware: factory replacement parts not available,"I have had this model for 8 months now. I upgraded my Shark robot that I loved for the self emptying feature. My original one was a work horse. I had it for 4 years with hardly any issues. I wanted to love this one, but outside of the self emptying feature, I don’t. Every time I turn around it’s erroring. It keeps erroring for the brush roll being stuck. It’s not. I have cleaned it multiple times and tried all of the troubleshooting to no avail. I was going to purchase a replacement brush roll from Shark but there’s not one available. I’m very disappointed in this purchase and would not recommend this model."
2,Only worked for 6 weeks,"After having to Roombas that bit the dust, I decided to try a Shark. I really liked this product when I first bought it. It NEVER mapped the house accurately, (and other reviews said the same thing) so I couldn't use the ""go clean the specific room"" feature, but that was ok because I wanted all rooms cleaned. It worked great for about 6 weeks. Then, it kept giving me the error to clean the brush. I cleaned the heck out of the brush, but i still won't work. I am VERY disappointed. I would return it, but the window for returns has closed. I am very disappointed."
2,"Avoid this brand, here is why...","I had a iRobot Roomba i3, it vacuumed up pet vomit and the unit broke/shorted out. My neighbor told me to try a ""Shark"", so i bought this one, set it up and turned it on and let it go. I found the setup a bit clumsy as you have to run power switches on the vacuum itself and the base station. We set it with the recommended settings and had it set up in our main, hardwood entry room which is large.
It came with a dead battery so it had to charge for almost 10 hours (wanted to throw that in there)...
The next morning we actually turned it on and it started, i had to run errands and i was surprised to come back almost 3 hours later and it was still in the same room, and the room was very clean, problem is it never moved out of that room. We have no obstacles, the whole downstairs is hardwood floors, but it wouldn't move out of that main room.
That being said i decided to call Shark, absolute nightmare, soon as you call you are pretty much greeted with a automated voice saying your old time is at least 30-90 minutes. I held for about 30 minutes before talking to someone with a horrible connection overseas. He told me this behavior was ""normal"" and to let it run and redock at least 10 times so it could ""map"" my home. I said fine but i told him it didnt seem like it was ""mapping"" correctly since it was essentially doing circles in one room only.
I decided to try this over the next 3-4 days, i rebooted the unit, i did everything the forums and help docs said to do but it never made it out of our main entry room. Even when i placed it in the kitchen it went back to the entry room! The mapping section of the app was confusing also, the tech i spoke to on the phone was confused about it too.
When all is said and done I'm heading to UPS to send this back, this tech is very far behind the iRobot's tech, the first try with a iRobot it mapped almost my whole downstairs and redocked itself. The new robot i bought was a upgrade, the J7+ and so far its a Rockstar. I would NOT recommend anything from Shark, they just seems to be about 10 steps behind iRobot."
2,My vacuum failed out of warranty. The app is junk,"I would not buy this again. The concept is great, but the operation and longevity leave something to be desired. I have had my vacuum for 2 years. We had it in storage for one of those years to due a home remodel.
It just failed the motherboard last week while sitting on the dock. It is out of the 1 year warranty, so I am on my own. Shark diagnosed the circuit board, but do not sell them. I found one on Ebay and will try to repair. Otherwise is $400 wasted. The Shark app for the Iphone is junk. If your vacuum disconnects from WiFi, there is a good chance that it will require a profile delete and create a new one. We have all hardwood floors and a dog that doesn't shed . Our home is spotless. However the filter screen on the robot vacuum needed to be cleaned after every use. It filled with a little dust and a tiny amount of dog hair at every use that plugs the fine cloth screen. The canister on the base needed to be cleaned every 2 uses as well as the air filter on the other side of the base. So much for once a month. The software is crap for the room mapping. You send it only to a room in the back of the house and it will clean the wrong rooms first and likely will not go to the room specified. You ask it to clean the whole house and it skips rooms even though they are mapped. I deleted the internal maps and followed all directions. It never got better. I would do your research. Buyer beware.

UPDATE: I bought a refurb motherboard from Ebay and repaired the vacuum. Why does Ebay sell refurb motherboards for Shark vacuums? Shark doesnt sell them."
2,Not Great,"I purchased this robot thinking it was on sale (deal). I paid $318 after taxes. I was interested in the features of ‘large capacity’ trash container and pet hair pick up. We have a black lab who sheds like mad. For reference, our home is almost 3k square feet and all bare floor (wood and tile). We have 2 area rugs, a small one by the door and a large round one in the bar/sitting area.

The ‘large capacity’ is a joke. I have to empty the trash bin container after every time the robot runs. It’s small. It’s horrible at picking up the pet hair, just pushes it towards the walls and doesn’t pick up. One of the little collector brushes on the robot broke off the first time it ran. It DOES NOT WORK ON RUGS OR CARPET. The robot simply deposits pet hair from the bare floor onto the rugs in clumps. I still have to vacuum behind this thing. Waste of your money. Keep saving up and buy a better robot with an actual large capacity bin that will truly pick up pet hair. This one is not great. At all."
2,Shark customer service is not existent,"I purchased a Shark IQ vacuum in December of 2020. It has never really worked correctly but after 3 months it got worse and now it is totally useless. It is kept in my bedroom and even since I have owned it, any time I started it cleaning, it would clean the bedroom completely before moving on to the requested room. This was even if I only requested it to clean the living room. Now over the past 3 months it has had all kinds of problems with the mapping and now no matter what I request it clean it cleans only the bedroom then goes to the dock. The vacuum is obviously defective. It is under warrantee for one year until December of this year. I have contacted Shark 3 times in the past 2 months. The first time I was told they would update the firmware over the next 48 hours so I should try it after that. I ran an entire house clean and that worked. Then a week or so later I tried to clean only one room and and it would clean the bedroom and the requested room. Then about a month ago, t I called Shark again because it was not working correctly and after about 2 hours the map was gone in the app and the vacuum would not respond to the app on the phone. At that point the rep said they would escalate the issue and I would receive a call back. I waited a week with no reply and called again. Talked to a supervisor who could not do anything except to tell me it has been escalated and that I needed to wait for a call back. I asked when and she told me she did not know. I pushed and she finally said she would try to have them call me back within the next 3 days. Needless to say it is our a week now and I have not gotten a call back. It because apparent to me that even though the reps stated they were Shark they are only a call center and have no power other than to take messages to pass on to Shark corporate. Shark really has no interest in solving my issues. I strongly suggest if you are considering buying one of the Shark robot vacuums that you look at other brands because Shark does not provide any support for defective machines, even though they state you have a one year warrantee."
2,Started out decent enough but....,"The vacuum looks really nice and the price isn't to bad compared to other higher end options BUT...The mapping feature is decent at best, the app is a bit clunky and it sucks you can only schedule the vacuum to clean once a day. It does an ok job picking up dog hair on wood floors and maybe I'm just not being fare about it because we do have 3 dogs but even after it runs I still have to go behind it and use my cordless vacuum to really get the floors clean. Even with all of that I could live with it, but with in weeks of owning it I kept getting messages through the app saying ""my roller is stuck"" so I would go and check it and sure enough the roller was full of dog hair. So I would clean it up and a few days later I would get the same message over and over and over. Then after a few months I started getting a error message through the app saying ""help I can't empty my dust bin because dust bin is not installed, please install the dust bin. Of course the dust bin is right where it's always been. I'd have to pick it up and empty the attached bin manually each time it does this.

So between the roller getting stuck all the time and the dust bin error I would caution people about buying this vacuum and instead spend a little more and get one that's had all the bugs worked out."
2,Meh,"We have had this for 3 months. Pros: I like the noise level of the vacuumed as it roams our home.

Cons: when it empties into the bin it sounds like a jet plane is landing in our kitchen. The suction is meh, even on the highest suction. And best of all? Today I spent 20 minutes on hold with customer support because the bumper was stuck (error 6). In the video call he determined that it was unfixable and that he would be sending a new one. After 3 months!"
2,"Popular, but not current. Easily clogged with dog hair","This model came out in 2019. It lacks the updated laser / LIDAR system so it can’t run in the dark and the maps aren’t as refined. Seems like it bumps into things more than the laser-guided model I had.

This unit successfully emptied about one load from its dust cup into the base. On runs 2 and 3, the debris got clogged in the robot’s outlet and just backed up from there. I had to empty it manually, which is a hard no for a $425 machine. Just returned it."
2,Only last 9 months,"I use it about once a week and at 9 months it died. Called support and they offered to replace it since it’s under warranty. Their policy is the buyer has to pay for shipping of $25. Also, they will not renew the warranty on the second vacuum so if it breaks down I will be out of luck. This is a very expensive investment so you should look into purchasing an extended warranty when it’s offered at the beginning. Giving two stars because I expected the product to last longer than 9 months, I have to pay for shipping, and because they cant guarantee/warranty the replacement vacuum. If I have to purchase a new vacuum I will look for another brand."
2,I know robot vacs aren’t perfect but..,"This thing was especially disappointing. At first, it seem to navigate pretty well. As long as it’s in the middle of the room with no obstacle no walls and no changing surfaces carpet to wood for example. But as soon as it finds an obstacle that isn’t a perfectly flat wall, it has trouble navigating around it. There was multiple things in my house that the machine got stuck on and even when I tried to design the map of my house it still did not work."
2,Mixed Review - YMMV,"Had the Vacuum (Shark RV1001AE) for about a month. I really wanted to love this robovac; but in the end it did not work out for me.

Pros::
First off on a positive note, the robovac is extremely easy to take apart and clean. (I have owned 3 other different brand robovacs that were just a pain to clean) I recommend anyone using one of these to clean it every other week, you will get a lot more out of the robovac.
The robovac is also very strong. Never had issues with it not picking up stuff off the floors or carpets. You can definitely tell when the vacuum had been run and when it had not.
The battery on the robovac is also fantastic. It was able to do multiple runs through my house (1800sq ft) each cleaning before it had to go back and charge.

Cons::
The robovac is just extremely loud. Everything about the robovac is loud. When its cleaning its loud to the point you find yourself not wanting it to run if your in the house. The self-emptying container noise level rivals that of a jet airplane (kidding but not).

I have a few rugs that are “fringed.” This robovac constantly gets stuck on the edge of the rug. It had made me choose, either the vacuum or the rug that was passed down from generations of my family.

The last straw for me was the “iq” part of the robovac. This robovac always runs into everything. It has got to the point that it started ripping up a lot of the baseboard in my house (see photo). I don’t know if this is because I have a piece of quart-round along my baseboards, or the robot is just not as high “iq” as it claims. I just know, my whole house has lots of sections where the robovac actually ripped chunks of the baseboard out.

Conclusion::

There are tons of robovacs on the market. I really wanted to love this, but found the cons of this robovac too hard to overlook the pros. This robovac functions more like a $150-200 type robovac rather than one twice the cost. I would advice people to look elsewhere for their robovac."
2,Not for heavy shedding dogs,"We have two dogs and one of them is a german shepherd/saint bernard mix and this vacuum cannot handle his fur. All of the fur gets clumped around the metal prongs so it constantly needs to be cleaned, it has a hard time sucking up the fur so it just spits it out in clumps even after emptying. We’ve had it for a little over 6 months now and the performance just keeps getting worse day by day. It gets stuck all the time and sometimes doesn’t even notify you. The app doesn’t give you the option to run it more than once a day. It’s also running into things all of the time and continues to run into the same thing over and over again like it’s fixated on that one spot.
Spits the fur out all over the rugs and floor matts. (I miss our Neato - wish the company didn’t go out of business, it was the only vacuum that could handle the fur)"
2,Works great- when it works,"I absolutely love the mapping feature compared to the ""dumb"" robot I had before. But after a few months, it wouldn't run because it thought the sidebrush was stuck. Customer service is only open certain hours and the robot kept dying because it would run just a few inches - enough to leave the charger and then get the error again. When I finally got ahold of customer service, they agreed to replace the main vacuum part, but I had to pay $11 for the shipping. Why am I paying because their product is defective? Assuming the replacement works, I'll keep using it but my next robot won't be a shark
Update: the replacement shell came in a different color so now I have a mis-matched vacuum"
2,Great unit but…,"This product does a great job cleaning but stopped working after two and a half months. Since I bought it through Amazon, there is a one year warranty but we had to pay for shipping to return it and for the replacement which was another $60 on top of what we had already paid for the unit. In addition, I will be without the unit for about 2 weeks and then everything will need to be reprogrammed. Shark help line is amazing!"
2,Is it supposed to be this LOUD?,"I have until July 30th to decide if I'm keeping or returning. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1. Packaging was awesome.
2. Could not setup with my phone; called tech support. They tried, then said I need to call my provider and ask them to change our something... meanwhile, my husband tried on his phone (we both have androids) and he had zero issues; told me to hang up!
3. The mapping was cool to watch. Vacs well, considering we don't have much debris. Only trying out our master bedroom, bath, and walk-in closet.
4. Haven't tried my phone again, but may.
5. BUT... is it supposed to be this loud??!! 😱 My daughter has a very cheap, non-mapping robot and is a tenth of the noise! Ugh!
6. Rosie. I named her Rosie, like from The Jetsons, since my husband says my hybrid Sorento sounds like I'm from the Jetsons. Lol... that aside, does Rosie stay? Or does she get returned?"
2,Not for Large Homes,"I have used this for only 3 months approximately 3-4 times a week. My personal opinion is that if you have more than 900 square feet this is not the robot for you. I have two small yorkies, live in West Virginia in the suburbs, do not make people take their shoes off, and clean often with other sweepers. I use the robot every other day for about 1400 square feet. It continues to catch in glass door tracks although I have worked with the no go zones over and over. It's front wheel falls off all the time. It runs over small toys and socks and sucks them up and stops and dies. The sensors on it are terrible. It will continuely run into something slightly turn itself and run into it again and again. It's caused damage on my floor registers and baseboards. The machine itself already is showing wear on the rollers, brushes, and rotators. I've had the filters out and cleaned them 3 times. It does pick up dust, hair, and small debris. But it is a challenge to run it because every small pushable item must be picked up. I thought we kept things picked up pretty good in our home until this robot. It doesn't like dog dishes, small toys, laundry baskets, toy bins, small rugs, small trash cans, shoes against the wall, doors half open, small stools, etc. It does not just ever go around something unless it bumps into it about 10 or so times or simply runs over it and sucks it up. I was shocked to find it in the corner dead with a big sock sucked up in it. And btw, for some reason, I cannot register this product on shark for the one year limited warranty."
2,Don’t recommend,"It worked amazing the first few times we used it, but than it got dumber and dumber and started getting Stuck on things.
We moved its location which seemed to mess it up even more.
I tried using the app to remap the house or do something to fix it. And the app wasn’t helpful at all. Kept freezing on me

This isn’t worth the money it costs.
I do not recommend this at all"
2,It could be much better,"For the price it’s lacking. It does vacuum which is its main job, but it gets stuck on silly stuff and lacks a lot of app features that the cheaper brands have. You can only schedule one clean a day for 1 time and your choice is on or off for that date and set time. You can set weekends different than weekdays ect. The few notifications it sends are always hours delayed. I run mine while we sleep and it won’t notify me if it gets stuck until after I find it stuck in the morning *eye roll* The app also panics if you press anything too quickly and will freeze."
2,Vacuum returns to docking station at 40% for no reason.,"I wish I knew why this thing works so badly. I started it at 100%, within 45 minutes it was down to 40%, then it returned to docking station. It unloaded its material which was hardly anything. Then it returned to the room it had just left. WHY did it go back to the dock at all? It goes over spots more then once. It does not vacuum the rooms efficiently. It wastes time going around objects and then incorrectly continuing on its path. It incorrectly scanned a room and doesn't vacuum it properly. I will have it reexplore the house and if it doesnt work better its going back. Also after it scanned the house you are unable to select a room to its exact dimensions, you can only select a square and hover over the section you want cleaned which usually means your cleaning parts of the another room????"
2,Mixed review,"Some of the positives of this Shark vacuum cleaner. First it does a good job of cleaning. We typically run it 3 times (or more) per week. We previously had a Roomba and can tell you the Shark is much quieter than the Roomba. We also like that the Shark maps the house and cleans in a pattern. While the Roomba simply wanders around, bumping into everything, you can direct the Shark to clean a specific room or area. The self-emptying function is a plus and well worth it, something we did not have with the Roomba.

The bad: We purchased the Shark 7 months ago and it is now dead. While Shark is going to replace the robot, we are being charged shipping and it will be 2 - 4 weeks before it is replaced. In our opinion $300.00 is just too much if it is only going to last 7 months."
2,Mediocre at Best. Disappointing!,"Mediocre cleaning at best. Our home is mostly hardwood flooring with only 2 area rugs. I am stunned. By the vast number of positive reviews, I was expecting much better results.
This vac's wands barely gathers anything from next to the wall or under cabinet bases.
We had an iHome vac that I absolutely LOVED. My son dropped it and popped it's eye sensor out. The model is no longer available, so we have tried 2 others including this Shark only to be disappointed by their efficiency. It does clean open floor about 75%, edges only 25%. Did I mention that for the price, it's disappointing!?"
2,Lasted about a year,"It worked for about a year. Then it started having random error messages. Eventually, it got a perpetually stuck brush roll… or something to that effect to cause it to give “error number 4” at all times. I did all the troubleshooting options available from Googling, and multiple articles said that still getting the error at that point means it’s busted. While it did work, it often ran into phantom cliffs in the middle of rooms, which made the “set it and forget it” scheduling a little pointless. Does a pretty good job on hardwoods, but area rugs never really appeared to be vacuumed. The Shark app is also annoying in that it doesn’t let you schedule by room; it has to be everything. Do I regret buying it? Yes! I’ve also learned now that Consumer Reports gives pretty bad reviews of Shark robot vacuums in general."
2,Disappointed - poor overall cleaning,"I rarely write poor reviews but I am very disappointed with the Shark, I have kids and a dog. My house gets dirty. I purchased a Roomba seven months and it does a good job ( We call it the marriage saver). I run the Roomba 6 hours a day and it needs to be emptied at least 3 times a day. I wanted a self- cleaning model and the Roomba was more expensive. I did my research and the Shark was highly rated. I have used the Shark for 6 weeks and it does a poor overall job cleaning compared to the Roomba. My issues are: 1) the single roller brush will pick up hair on hardwood floors but not on carpet. 2) the one arm side brushes do nothing, so the intake must go directly over the dirt to clean. 3) Shark will go over the floors twice but does not clean nearly as well as the Roomba - the floor are still gritty and not smooth.. 4) poorly made - the housing for the brush falls off when it runs across a wire or anything on the floor, 5) almost anything other than dirt or hair will it stop the brush and shut it off.. 6) it sometimes gets lost. 7) the battery life is short, it will sometimes just shut down in the middle of a job and you have to go find it. 8) it takes at least 2 hours to charge.
I clean the unit daily to remove any hair, debris and blow out the air filter and it does not help.
This purchase was an expensive mistake. My spouse is going to throw the Shark in the trash and I will be purchasing a Roomba."
2,I’m not quite sold…,"I really want to like this and hope in time it will be useful but as of now this robot is a bit of a tease. It is scheduled to start each night at 9 pm and when it starts it just seems like a big cluster of chaos. I watch it in frustration as it tries to navigate our house which is large but only 1 story. We do not have it clean our kids rooms at all or our media room. Much of the time I even close of the master suite so it can just do well in the other areas of our house. This still hasn’t helped. It is only used on wood and tile surfaces and often stops throughout its routine with some sort of issue. It’s almost as if I need to babysit it. The mapping is not great. It does note that mapping is updated and sometime not available until it has cleaned 10 times but I do not find this to be true. I also don’t see that the map is updating or that it really follows a map. Although it has the self emptying canister, it does not prioritize time to ensure it empties before it is completely clogged and I have to swoop in to save it. It also doesn’t project how much time from its placement it needs so that it doesn’t completely deplete the battery while getting back to home base. This means I often find it dead and full in random parts of our house. I should also mention this is just a supplemental vacuum for us and I vacuum with our central vac daily and sometimes multiple times a day. We have dogs and there is hair and sometime pine needles but it just would not seem this robot is effective for even basic upkeep or even supplemental help. I’m still wondering if I should return or if it will in fact learn and get better at what it is designed to do. A friend has the iRobot and it hands down has better mapping than this machine."
2,Lost map within first month,"Neat concept, but design of app failed! Had to completely rerun to explore house to map it as the app lost its map that has been used for several weeks. Also has issues with traversing 3/4 inch threshold between floors"
2,Clean spots where it shouldn’t,"I’ve had this for a while and thoroughly enjoyed it but for some reason now after I re-mapped my house because I had move my couch around, it would go in spots where I marked off to not go and sometimes it only goes and cleans some areas of the house only. It constantly gets stuck in the areas I marked off not to go since I have ledges where it’s a little high for it to go over, and end up helping it get out. I don’t know what to do at this point…."
2,Does not hold a candle to a 3year old Roomba,"I purchased this Shark smart vac because I have found Shark products have impressively powerful suction, and the description said it could be voice controlled using the Alexa device. The app is rudimentary, doesn’t have half the features of iRobot/Roomba app and Alexa voice control does not work 99% of the time., says unable to communicate with the robot. Also, you are unable to set cleaning times for specific rooms or areas.
Basically, the Shark’s only settings are ON or OFF.
You can set it to vacuum your entire mapped area once a day every day, or you can pick it up, set it in the room you want vacuumed and turn it on, but that is all you can do.
Positives:
It does have a good suction and will complete a cleaning cycle faster than my Roomba, also it does not bump into things, and make as much noise as a Roomba because of the radar sensors.

I have used my Roomba I6 plus daily for 3 years.
I thought the Shark would replace the Roomba which is getting a bit worn out, but I am finding that my Shark is sitting in the closet, and my trusty old Roomba is being used every day, because I can use my voice or the app to send Roomba to vacuum under the Christmas tree or into the kitchen for quick clean ups. I would have sent the Shark back, had I not missed the return deadline."
2,"Can't map multiple levels, hair gets wrapped around brush roll","For the main level of our house, which is mapped, it does a good job. However, it cannot map multiple levels of the house. So you can bring it upstairs or to the basement and press clean, but it goes around randomly, repeating some areas multiple times and completely missing large areas. For the price I'm really disappointed that it does not have this feature.

It also claims to have a self-cleaning brush roll. This is definitely not true – I have to cut off hair at least once every time it runs."
2,"App needs work, vacuum has some issues","BLUF: I would not recommend this vacuum until the app is improved and more user friendly.

The app for this vacuum is very sub-par when compared to other similarly priced robot vacuums. You can schedule cleaning the whole house, but you can't schedule for specific rooms. You can't control the level of power during the schedule. You can't schedule more than one cleaning per day. When viewing the clearing history, you cannot see where the vacuum has been other than a purple blob in the rooms. I expect to see the actual path. After you have mapped the house, working in the app to identify your rooms is a very painful and unintuitive process. My wife gave up trying and it took me 30 min to finally get the rooms properly identified.

Ultimately, we returned the vacuum because of the app issues AND the fact that this vacuum doesn't properly vacuum my entire house when scheduled to do so. The attached image shows one of the whole house scheduled runs. As you can see it only vacuumed a very small part of one room... don't know why, nothing was in its way. This was a pattern on two other scheduled cleaning as well.

While running this vacuum on its eco mode the vacuum is still very loud when we expect it to be whisper quiet. It should not be as loud as my push vacuum when in eco mode.

The vacuum does a good job to get the dirt off the hard floors and the auto unloading of the dirt into the trash receptacle worked extremely well (albeit excessively loud). It would gently bump into things and not be like the battering ram of some robot vacs. I would also comment that it did a good job cleaning my carpets."
2,"Amazing when it works, awful when it doesn’t. Terrible warranty program.","I have purchased 2 of this exact model. When it works it is the best robot vaccuum I have found. I ordered 4 different models before choosing this one. About 3 months into owning it, randomly gets lost. A firmware update sorta fixed that issue. Now 3 months later I’m having issues where it randomly gets lost again. The left spinning brush sometimes doesn’t spin. Which then causes the vaccuum to stop in place and sit until it dies. Pretty frustrating. If they could fix the issues I would give it 6 stars. Because when this thing operates as designed it is amazing. Now the other bad part. The warranty is suppose to cover issues. Except they require the consumer to pay for shipping. Kind of sad spending $500+ on a vaccuum and it breaks within 5 months the consumer has to cover the return shipping to receive a used replacement. Because of this I cannot recommend this vaccuum anymore. Sharks warranty is a joke and apparently so is the software that operates the vaccuum."
2,Not for me.,"After having used a Eufy g30 for 3 years I was super excited to try shark's lineup of vacuums. Unfortunately, this one wasn't for me, and I honestly wasn't impressed by its performance. For starters it is way louder than I expected. My g30 was relatively quiet when I first received it and has specific quiet modes that work really well. Shark has 3 modes of suction which all sound equally as loud, and the wheels and brush are constantly making noise, overall making it kind of annoying to run. On top of that the home base station is SUPER loud when transferring debris. Maybe these issues are fine for people who go to work but since I work from home it was a no go. Also the thing is too tall, wont go under a lot of my furniture. Another issue was that while the instructions said it would map my whole house, it pretty much mapped a section of my house and every subsequent cleaning it just did that same section. Furthermore it would get stuck under chairs and on slight inclines and shut down, waiting to be picked up.

I suppose if you have it set to clean when you aren't home, have perfectly flat floors all throughout, and a relatively small sq footage house, this might work for you, but for me these were all dealbreakers."
2,Not so Bright and Needs Light,"Play Video
Overall, it works if it just needs to clean the whole accesible area. We have hardwood floors and it seems to get most of the dog hair amd random debris. I can't imagine this cleans all that thoroughly on deep pile carpeting, though does alright on the oriental rugs. The reason for 2 star review is due to three major shortcomings: It has to have light to clean and you can't schedule by room and cleaning by room simply does not work, it's either whole house or nothing. The scheduling could be solved with an app update or you can manually start it and specify a room UPDATE: Never mind, specifying a room is useless. Nine times out of ten it goes in the exact opposite direction. We've thouroughly mapped and made sure rooms don't overlap. So if you're hoping to not have to pick up in an area, you're out of luck, it'll peobably wander there anyways, regardless of how far from your specified cleaning area. When it does manage to find tge room it does a swipe or two and tgen goes off to clean somewhere else. The light thing is why I'm looking to buy a different model. The hope was to have the thing clean at night after we went to bed, but you'd have to leave all the lights on in the house to do that effectively. Which would basically double or triple the energy required for this thing to run. We were also hoping we could exclude the bedrooms at night and have them run in the morning after we went to work, but that point is moot. Even during the day we have a few rooms that need the lights turned on or it bumbles around like it's got a severe head injury and usually cries out for help. It also seems to regularly miss areas, even with lights on. Which means if you thought you'd never need to vacuum, think again. Definitely reduces the frequency of vacuuming though. Usually use the Dyson stick vac once a week or so to get corners and such and every month or so we vacuum the rugs with an upright and a decent amount comes up. It's alright, but looking at what else can be bought at this price point, especially with sales and I'll be looking elsewhere."
2,Really wish it worked,"I can't even tell you how much I wanted this thing to work. But I can assure that it wanders uselessly my house with no rhyme or reason, cleaning the same area dozens of times and never ever cleaning a few particular areas....like the left side of my kitchen. Why won't it go there? There's no threshold, no barrier, it is literally a plain vanilla open floorplan with nothing to block it or even bump in to, yet it goes back and forth repeatedly on the right side of the kitchen and completely refuses to get the other side. Is that where some directed energy device installed by Russian spies is beaming microwaves into my body? I have no clue, but it's mind boggling and so frustrating that I can't enjoy a clean floor in that part of my kitchen while my brain is zapped by radiation.

On a positive note, it has decent suction and got my floors clean for the parts it decided to vacuum. It's really the mapping and navigation that is major letdown, even after resetting the maps twice and letting it rediscover my house.

Definitely sending it back and will try some other model or technology. This device just does not work in any sort of consistent or practical manner."
2,Does not stay connected to WiFi,I have had problems with my robot from the start. It would not connect and stay connected to internet. I have excellent wifi. Once per week I have to reconnect and remap the robot. I have contacted shark 5 times over the last 2 weeks. I was told I would be contacted by the escalation team and gave my specific hours of availability. They tried to contact me 3 times outside of the my available hours then closed my ticket because I didn’t answer. When I called back to open another ticket I was told that because my robot currently said it was connected to the internet the escalation team will probably just close my ticket and not contact me. Dealing with their customer service has been a joke. When I pay $400 for a vacuum I expect it to work and get fixed or replaced if it doesn’t. I like the vacuum and it works well when connected but remapping and reconnecting to the wifi once per week is time consuming when the point of the robot is to take away one thing on my plate. I’m to the point I just hand vacuum because it takes less time than resetting up the robot. It does well on hard surfaces but carpet it struggles.
2,Phone App,"This product is almost impossible to connect to the phone app so you have to manually push the button to start the machine. Their customer service is worthless so don’t even try to call them. If you need help, watch YouTube videos, out better yet get a different brand."
2,"Great idea but doesn’t work well enough for the price, yet...","I’ve loved Shark vacuums and wanted to love this one but wasn’t sure so I bought several on Black Friday. I watched TONS of reviews and evaluated specs for many models.

I liked this dust bin over Roomba because it’s bagless but it doesn’t suck everything out of the internal dust bin. It’s also messy. The machine and large bin were covered in dust constantly. The internal dust bins are small since they can empty, but if you have dirty floors they have to empty more often. Shark doesn’t have a sensor so it just goes back every 30 minutes to empty.

The battery isn’t great. Need to clean about 1200sq ft and it has to charge half way through.

Suction isn’t great either. I had the Shark run first and when I ran the Roborock S6 Pure after it, the Roborock picked up twice as much.

Mapping is horrible. Ran it many times, during the day and with lights on. It would make partial maps but not a complete one. Compared to Roborock, it is a complete fail.

It’s also louder than other brands. This didn’t bother as much and if the suction and empty bin worked as I’d hoped I would’ve kept it regardless of the noise level.

The app isn’t great either. It’s enough but others are so much better.

The new technology of having robot vacuums empty is a great idea but they need some changes to be effective and worth the price.

After trying the Shark, Roomba i7 and Roborock S6 Pure I’m keeping the Roborock. I agonized about upgrading to the Roborock S6 MAXV but double the price for a little more water for mopping and upgraded suction didn’t seem worth it. So Roborock it is. The S6 Pure is a step down from the S6 but the differences are negligible. I like the mop on the Roborock too. It doesn’t replace mopping but keeps the house fresh between deep cleans. The battery is AMAZING at 5200 and the mapping is spot on. It uses lasers and you can watch it map on the first run. On subsequent runs you can see where it is. It has no go lines and boxes and the app was easy to use with great functionality.

Hoping the emptying systems get better with future models so consumers can enjoy power, mopping and emptying all in one. But for now, it isn’t there and this one is going back.

If you’re looking to learn about the various robot vacuums check out videos from Vacuum Wars or Moderm Castle. They had the best information for deciding what is best for your home."
2,Unsatisfied,"I search for the best rating robot vacuum before purchasing the ""Shark"". It had 5 stars. I was excited to get it also for the self emptying feature. But I'm not satisfied with performance. It misses places and doesn't pick up billed up hair as it should be. It just doesn't seem to have power. I regret in buying this product. I wish I can return it and get a better one that picks up the dog hair."
2,Worked ok for about 6 months - then continual error codes,"Doesn’t clean like a normal vacuume but does OK to keep a clean floor clean. Still need a good stand up to clean up corners built up dirt and debris so this by no means is a replacement.

Unfortunately after 6 months I Constantly get error code to “clean under shark logo” there is an issue with the lidar system and it does not appear to be fixable. Customer support is useless."
2,"Not great, just ok",I've had this product since July. It frequently gets clogged and requires hands on cleaning & debris clean out. If you have pets this is NOT a good choice!
2,I don't know how this has good reviews,"I've been an irobot guy for over a decade. When my last one broke, I thought I'd give this one a try. First, the app is not nearly as good as irobot. You can't schedule specific rooms and it's not as intuitive. Second, it doesn't do the entire room. It will only do little sections. The run time is limited. Lastly and most importantly , it does NOT do well with animal hair. I have had this for about a month and every single time I run it,it gets clogged and I have to take it apart. I'm keeping it for the time being but I will most likely go back to irobot."
2,Just too many flaws.,"This is my 3rd Shark robotic vacuum and, in general, I really like them. My comparison is equally on par since all are smart versions with mapping and self-emptying bins. This being the newest I thought it would also be the best. Nope.

First, this vacuum is loud. Like ridiculously loud compared to other models. The fan is loud. The motor is loud. The roller brush sounds like a dump truck rolling through the house. I just don’t get it.

Second, the battery life is much shorter than previous models. It has to return to the base multiple times to recharge just to clean the house a single time, which causes it to run pretty much all day. Start cleaning…30 minutes later back to recharge for 2-3 hours…cleans for 30 minutes…back to charge for 2-3 hours…cleaning restarts again. Geez! Just get it done already. And because of the noise, it ends up grating my last nerve by the end of the day.

Lastly, the self-emptying feature on this one regularly has problem. Nothing unusual in the bin either. Just basic dust, debris, hair, etc.

As sad as this makes me, there is no way to recommend this particular model."
2,It works,Loved the vacuum while it worked.quit working 6 months after purchase .the roller was not working called customer service. They charged me a11.00 shipping fee and a month later still have not gotten the part. Says it’s on back order so not able to use the vacuum
2,Brushroll is stuck!,Keeps coming up with the #4 error. Brush roll is stuck! Need to clean brush roll. But I clean it and it comes right back with same error. Gets between 12-16 inches fromt he home base and stops again. I have taken everything off that I possibly can to clean it. Cleaned all the rollers and or wheels. It hasn't gone more then 2 feet in 6 months!
2,Out of the box it was giving me an error,"Never worked out of the box. Instantly started throwing an error code to check bumper, bumper was fine but kept throwing same code. Trash item."
2,Doesn't last,"Overall we really like this vacuum... but now, just about 2 years it has completely lost its mind. Just circling the base, not cleaning"
2,Does not work,"I only purchased this because it says it has the capability to scan and go around things in the floor. I have an old dog, so this is important. This is false and fasley advertised. It has run over animal detriment. EVERY TIME It runs over the dog bowls and sucks up water. The whole saling point was you wouldn't need to pick up. Which meant I could run it while at work. Nope, I have to do the same as my old one and walk the floors. Save your money there is no need to upgrade to this model."
2,Dumbest smart vac I have ever had,"This thing does pick up dirt, but smart vac, no. It's dumber than an election denier. It maps however it wants, won't go around obstacles smaller than 1 1/2"" high like books or sandals. It's got drive power and if it runs into something and it moves, it will push it until it can't go any further. It would rather try and drive over anything in it's path. It will pick up poop and smear it while clogging itself. Roller gets jammed easily by socks, charger cords, paper clips, twist ties, and the dirt bin often packs full before it auto empties and then it just tries to empty then resumes its cycle while it keeps packing it the dirt and pushing it around. Don't ask it to just clean a specific mapped room, it'll just go wherever it wants and never do what you asked it to do. Tell it to return to the dock and it will...when it feels like it. Could be 3 minutes, could be 30. A stubborn child listens better. The boundary strips do work and if you pick up the dog toys prior to using, it might complete it's run. Thankfully it got snagged on a sock and stopped short of a pile of puppy turds. Otherwise it would have smeared it into the corner and all over the dock. That was it. It got turned off and I'm looking at a j7+
Does it clean, yes. Is it smart, no. I've even reset and tried to edit maps...it doesn't care. It goes where it wants if there isn't a boundary set up. If you don't have dogs that pull everything out of their toy box during the day and have a clear floor, then this is a good vacuum. If your life isn't as predictable, look for something smarter."
2,Stay Away,"Garbage product. They can't even decide what model# it is. When it worked, it worked fine, but ordering replacement brushes are a crap-shoot as you can't find OEM parts, only cheap knock-offs. Really bad decision to buy this unit."
2,Good while it lasted,Worked great for about 6 months. Now it moves a couple feet and dies.
2,Intelligence,"Had this for about 2 years now, it seems to get ""dumber"" as time goes on. Spends time visiting the same area, trying to climb the fan. And as time goes on, I've replaced the roller, brushes, filters a few times already, and it works good for a short time, they it sucks up the pet hair that it accumulates and it deposits them in random spots. On a plus side it's easier to suck up the hairs ball than operating a hand held on the whole floor."
2,NEVER AGAIN! Customer service is not helpful!,"NEVER AGAIN! Customer service is not helpful!
I bought my first Shark robot vacuum in March 2020. I loved it! It did a good job of cleaning up pet hair and dust on hard floors, and helped control the dust bunnies under furniture on carpet. It did not do a very good job of cleaning carpet, but I expected that from such a small vacuum. It mapped my house well, always found its way back to the dock, never got stuck under furniture, connected and stayed connected to WiFi easily. Unfortunately, it completely died within 90 days of purchase. Called customer support and they immediately replaced the robot unit. Things have gone down hill since then. The replacement unit struggled to map and find the dock. I mistakenly assumed these issues were due to it being a refurbished unit. I wanted a second unit for my basement so I purchased a second brand new identical unit October 2020.
I have had more trouble with the new unit. It will not connect to WiFi, it gets stuck and can't find the dock often. It repeatedly gives me errors to empty the dust bin and dock (when they are empty) or to check under the robot for an obstruction. I have called customer service dozens of times since October and 8 times in the past 10 days. Every time I call I get a new person that makes me go through the trouble shooting checklist again and then tells me try this...and call back. I call back and have to go through the entire checklist again. They apparently have no record of previous calls or records of the trouble shooting checklist from one call to the next. They can usually get the errors to clear but it will not connect to WiFi. Shark Customer service is blaming my home network for the issues. The home network works with all my devices except the Shark!
I suppose you get what you pay for. I'll be saving my money and will replace this piece of junk with a Roomba!"
2,Updated. Brooke within 2 years. Very Quiet but self cleaning brush doesn’t work.,"Pros: Very quiet. Compared to Roomba, this thing is like a ghost moving from room to room. The mapping seemed to work well and quickly and I was able to set up boundaries/rooms to keep it where I need it. I like that it has a locator feature! It self empties like a charm. It doesn’t seem to get stuck half as often as my Roomba does. It still got stuck at the top of the stairs with one wheel hanging over but only once as compared to every time with Roomba. It also doesn’t bump into walls/furniture/doors way Roomba does. It senses them and backs off. The battery is really good compared to the Roomba. I have used eco and recharge/resume modes and eco cleans for almost 2 hours and doesn’t miss a room (1200SF ish).
Cons: It doesn’t self clean the brush as advertised. I mean I think it tries to but both my husband and I have long hair and it is fully wrapped around the brush. I’ll have to cut it off at least every week. I think it could probably handle short hair or pet hair though. It is easier to clean off the brush than Roomba because it has fewer and shorter bristles but I also think that makes it a less efficient design for getting into the carpet fibers to clean, you know? I have a Kirby and you can totally tell the difference in the carpet when I use the Kirby versus the Shark. So the shark is for daily surface cleaning (which it does well!) and the Kirby is for real cleaning.
I don’t think this Shark is worth $500 but I paid $350 which seems about right for what it does. I hope it lasts at least 3 years.

Update: it did not, in fact, last 3 years. It’s got some kind of invisible blockage on one of the sensors. Nothing seems to fix it. I decided the self cleaning brush part works well enough though. Way better than the roomba. But the lifespan sucked. I’ll be going back to roomba. Those things last so much longer."
2,Missing basic parts,"Received the used version and was unpleasantly surprised to find that the vacuum didnt come with brushes or any extra consumables, instruction manual, etc. Thought it would at least come with these basics."
2,Great product - IF you never have a power outage,"I bought this robot in December of 2023, so I've had it about 3 1/2 months. It first I thought it was amazing, that is until we had a power outage. I had to reset my Starlink network, assigning my router a new password. Of course the robot was no longer connected to the network. I thought repairing it would be easy - but not so fast.

The scant, poorly written instructions say to connect to the Shark WifFi using your mobile device that has the Shark app on it. It also said the app will pick up automatically in this mode. Well, I tried. The app never picked gave me any options to connect to a network. I've scoured the app pages over and again and I can find nothing. I tried reading their manuals, but as we all know in IT, user manuals are often the item that gets the least amount of funding and are more often than not useless.

So, here we are - I have this supposedly great robot that I can control in so many ways and I am having to manually start and stop it. To say I am thoroughly annoyed would be an understatement."
2,Doesn’t have much storage capacity for dog hair!,We have 3 dogs and I run this unit room by room rather than whole house because it clogs up before 15 minutes run time. It also won’t empty because it gets clogged in the shark. My last shark I had for almost 5 years but rarely clogged. This unit isn’t as good but the gps location for room to room is great. Rarely gets stuck anywhere. I have to physically empty after every run. If don’t have dogs you should be fine.
2,Don't upgrade your wifi or you'll be SOL,"Let me start by saying I LOVED (emphasis on the past tense) this robot vacuum. I had no trouble setting it up and it mapped my entire first floor with many rooms the first day I had it. The app worked perfectly--I could send it just to one room at a time, schedule routine cleanings, change the power of the suction used, etc. Then, after about a month of cleaning bliss, I made the ""mistake"" of cutting the cable cord and upgrading my internet, which came with a brand-new router. Now, I have many devices in my home that run via wifi and have successfully connected all of them. But not Sharky Shark, despite MULTIPLE calls with Shark customer service AND with Verizon. I even went through the process of separating out a secondary wifi network that would run on 2.4 frequency (which seems to be a requisite for this device for some reason). I have spoken to 5 different customer service reps at Shark and they seem clueless about a problem that I can't imagine is novel since lots of people get new routers, etc. if they're tech savvy enough to have robots in their home. Very, very frustrating and disappointing. P.S. I am now waiting for a callback from the ""escalation"" team of experts at Shark. If they don't call back in the 4 hour window provided I'm planning to return this. Now that I know how much functionality I'm losing without the app, I feel it should be replaced with one that works properly."
2,"Half baked, not ready for prime time.","I was replacing a non-smart Neato. After doing a lot of research I decided to try the Shark. I hoped it would perform at the same level as the Neato. Sadly it was a big let down, had to return it.

Pros:
1. Easy to schedule from app. App gives you quick startup functions remotely.
2. It has three levels of vacuum suction and even low seems to work ok.
3. Tower makes emptying the vacuum easy. The tower only needed to be emptied once in the 25 days I ran the vacuum.
4. Vacuum ran in the dark and under furniture (a lot of camera guided vacs do not).
5. Battery life was excellent, around 2 hours on normal suction.

Cons:
1. This Vacuum is shockingly loud on hardwood floors, on carpet it's ok. The agitator makes it sound like a boat motor.
2. The vacuum got stuck 90+% of the time. A couple times that was my fault because it ran over a sock, but it usually it got stuck under furniture because it would not back out. It would have enough room to turn and move forward, but would not 360 out, or it would wedge itself into spaces. The most offensive stoppages were when it would slightly bump into something with a curved shape and just stop. Its bumper some how gotten slightly pressed in and down (I guess), but no other obstruction.
3. Only 50% of the time the app would tell me it was stuck. Most functions were next to useless.
4. Locating the robot was difficult because the command for location only makes the robot chime once, not repeatedly. When found and freed the battery was usually low, so I would send it back to the dock in the app. It would then go into low power mode and continue to vacuum, instead of heading directly to the dock. So the command didn't seem to make a difference except to switch it to low power mode.
5. The Map never worked! Used for 25 days with multiple trips on most days. Occasionally the crude drawing would shrink or grow but never complete. Most days no change.

Conclusion:
I wanted to like this bot. When working it seems fine. The tower function is awesome. But the vacuum just keeps getting stuck. I could not rely on it to do its job."
2,Low suction power and doesn't reach the edge of the walls,"It does not reach the edges of the rooms, and lack of suctioning power, my old zoozee generic robot cleans much better and this is not a comercial. Also the purpose of this one is low maintenance as it has a self empty base but it gets stuck every time with derbis or anything that requieres a lot of attention. Lastly it goes to base and sometimes doesn’t hook properly to the base and it doesn't charge when I need it is has no battery."
2,"Won't connect, impossible to empty","We've had this for a few years now and it will not for whatever reason, stay connected and run on a schedule. I've uninstalled and re-installed the app 100x and it wont do anything. Also forget trying to pair it with Alexa. The bin constantly comes off too when going over something like a thin rug. It's also VERY loud when it gets to dock and empties. To empty the bin when it gets full is another challenge. You have to almost pry it open and hope dirt don't go flying everywhere, putting it back on the dock is another issue in itself. Not impressed with this thing at all, looking for another."
2,Don't complicate things. Know what you are buying:,"We've owned three automated vacuums. The first two were fine. This one empties itself, kinda. Just know there are several filters that have to be changed, often, often, and often. The ""self emptying"" process starts to stink after about a week. Our old ones had one filter but needed just a bit more cleaning afterwards. This one requires very much more maintenance. It says its good for pets but its not. It clogs up fairly quickly. The smallest leaf or obstruction causes an ""error #9"". It'd probably be fine without pets or plants around your house but it clogs up easily. I'll keep it simple going forward. I can empty my own bin each time."
2,Funcionalidad,No sé puede descargar la app en Argentina
2,Where do I begin?,"OK, so I read reviews of several vacuums before purchasing. Based on those reviews, I came into this purchased with lowered expectations, as all robot vacuums have their strengths and weaknesses. This product has continually underwhelmed my even lower expectations. First -NO MAP. Ran 75 times, map would not complete. Called customer service, got firmware update, then deleted partial map (per their instruction), and started over. Ran 75 more times, NO MAP. Firmware update, deleted partial map, started over. No attempting to map a 3rd time, we will see. Without a map, many of the features I want to use are not enabled. Next - TERRIBLE ON CARPET. I have one room with carpet. Leaves visible debris on carpet, not sure if it is actually doing anything. Run 5 days a week, then vacuum carpet, and have a full canister on my Dyson. I know this robot is just supplemental - but a full canister after 5 cleanings? Is it doing anything??? PET HAIR - Bought this specifically for pet hair. Roller is advertised as designed to not wrap pet hair. This is correct. However, the spindles on the ends of the rollers clog with pet hair after 2 runs, so has to be removed and cleaned out anyway. CLEANING PATTERN - Shark touts the fact that the robot does not simply bounce around, but runs on a grid pattern. OK great - but seems to clean some rooms over and over again, while ignoring other rooms completely. Also, any mats in the floor (like bathrooms) will be a constant source of errors for getting stuck. Bought 25 more feet of magnetic boundary to just make the vacuum go around these pads completely. APP - The app is not robust. No way to edit map until it has completed mapping. No way to steer robot to aid in mapping. Map is microscopic on screen, and is difficult to read. Product gets two stars because it does some things OK, and customer support has always been friendly, but I cannot recommend this product...."
2,Meh performance for the high price point,"If you have pets, then this is not the vacuum for you. It will vacuum up pet hair, but unless you are cleaning it out/removing the hair every 3 minutes while it is vacuuming then it will stop, error out and then you'll have to take it apart to remove all the hair. The self-empty base doesn't have powerful enough suction to remove the pet hair either, so a lot of time is spent cleaning out both units. I gave up using it on a regular basis and now use it for spot cleaning. I purchased a regular Shark vacuum, and it works perfectly, so this robotic vacuum not working as it should is very frustrating."
2,Worked great for a few weeks,"Initially I really liked the vacuum and it did what it's supposed to do. I've had it for less than 3 months and it's almost unusable now. It's constantly saying there's a new error and unless I disassemble and reassemble the vacuum it won't run - this happens 3-4 times per week. When I get it running and ask it to clean the house it skips rooms and will randomly turn around to go back to the home base. Now it has started to spit out all the dust it picked up on its way back to the home base, so there's a trail of dirt and dust going from wherever it gave up to its home base that i have to vacuum with my regular vacuum. I already had to replace the battery after owning it for 2 months. Very disappointed I wasted money on a vacuum that only worked for three weeks."
2,Had to return,"Seems like a good product - when it works. Needed tech support to finally get it going. That took awhile to get it set up. It worked great the first time it ran. Then it had difficulty getting out of the room it was docked it. It would leave its base, travel in the room, hit a wall, and return to the base. Sometimes it would leave the room, travel part way down the hall, turn around and return to dock. Did this repeatedly several times. Remapped the house with it several times to see if that would resolve the problem. Again called tech support. Followed their directions, and they sent a firmware update to it via the base. Tried it again and it worked - 1 time. Now its back to where it will hit a wall in the room where its docked, then go back to the base. I made adjustments to the program in the app as the tech had me do on a prior occasions. It continues to leave the base travel in the room, then return to base. It will sometimes go into the hall, until it bumps the wall and then returns to its base.
I'm concerned that this is going to be an ongoing issue so I returned it. I have spent a lengthy amount of time trying to get it to follow its program. We will try another brand."
2,doesnt get edges clean,"Photos are under my kitchen cabinet immediately after a super duper “mattrix” cleaning this morning. Left all kinds of debris. My rug is very flat and should not have interfered. I guess my expectations for a robo vac were too high. this does an ok job but does not get edges of floors around walls and under cabinet over hangs, or corners clean. even on matrix. and it does not get edges around rugs clean--and my rugs are pretty low pile flat ones. it does do a decent job of overall vacuuming, but if i have to go around every wall of my house with my regular vacuum anyway, i'm not sure this thing was such a great deal. bought it on pre-prime special. glad i didn't pay full price. the app is not real clear on setting up rooms but after a few tries i figured it out. a few times the vac got plugged up and wouldn't clean itself out. ive been running it often, trying it out, so my floors aren't very dirty, so why it got plugged up is a mystery. no pet hair here. all in all, i'm pretty meh about it. don't think it's worth the money."
2,"After a year of use, the robot refuses to clean. Great when it works, useless when it refuses.","I purchased this unit a little over a year ago. Ran great for the first 6 months -could not have been happier with it- then I started encountering an error more and more frequently. Specifically, error #2. The unit will start up, move a few feet, the red error light will pop on, and it will proudly announce that I need to check underneath the robot for obstructions, decrying that it's suffering from ""error number two"". Until recently, resetting the robot and doing a cursory hair removal from its roller brush would be enough to fix things. As of yesterday, I cannot get this error to go away.

I check beneath the robot. There are no obstructions. The dust cup is empty. The rollers are clean. The brushes are spinning freely. I have tackled the inside of this thing with compressed air, tweezers, damp rags... everything I can do to make sure there isn't a single piece of cat hair stuck in any of its accessible moving parts.

And yet it still stubbornly refuses to move until I remove an obstruction.

I'm going to get my screwdriver set out and take the casing apart to hopefully dislodge some massive furball from the motor. If that fails to achieve anything, I'm using this unit for target practice and buying a Roomba."
2,Connected to base to fully charge only 1 time,"It only docked and charged fully 1 time. Subsequent uses, never docked and charged adequately. It would die before finishing part of 1 room. Directions are useless, no troubleshooting help. I prefer to read good directions, not watch videos. The videos I did watch didn't help resolve the issue. I can't address the other features, since the cleaner wouldn't charge enough to determine those qualities. My understanding was it was supposed to self empty into the base or not need to be emptied for 60 days-- no info about this in manual, and no evidence that it was going to work."
2,Modest Performance - Struggles to Dock,"My wife loves it. We have two dogs and this does a pretty good job keeping up after them. Manage your expectations, it’s a robot dustbuster. We vacuumed twice a week before, still do, this keeps the house in a state like the day after we vacuum. It’s not a human or a full fledge vac. It picks up wood floors pretty well, it can pick debris off carpet but doesn’t get too much hair off them. It fills the canister it emptied into in about a week, it works hard. Because it has a dump, we don’t have to empty the tray daily and if we don’t get to vacuuming this little bot has put back. It reduces our workload.

I bet the iRobot is better, it was a lot more money. I can see where the Shark struggles to dock sometimes and you can tell when it gets lost. From time to time it catches a cord or something that we forgot to pickup. It makes noise, it should or it wouldn't pick up a thing. Vacuums make noise. I used the app to set it up to run when nobody is home. The app was really easy to use. All in all we have no regrets. We are pleased with what it does and it lessens the household workload.

Update: downgrade to 3 stars after a few months of use. Shark gets lost in my house. It gets stuck easily. The wheels have damaged my wood floor in a handful of places when it gets stuck. It drives in circles around table legs when it’s lost. It skips room all the time. The vac itself looks like it beat up because it drives into all my stuff to sense things. Eventually all my stuff is going to be beat up too. Despite all this, very time I empty it is full of dirt so it does work.

Update 2: Just don’t buy one of these. I’m tired of sending back for warranty repairs that don’t get fixed. I have to put it on the dock every day. I have to empty the cartridge. It’s easier just to vacuum the house then let this joke try to do it. It lacks the sensors and intelligence needed to do what it’s advertised to do. Shark tried but at the end of the day they made a Chevy Cavalier and marketed it like it was a Toyota Avalon.

Update 3: Shark bot is still going. It’s still painful to watch it take 30 minutes to dock. I can tell the firmware of the unit has changed as there are things it does differently since I bought it. Christmas week it decided to vacuum the house 3 times a day. It’s a random performer, you never know what it’s going to do or clean."
2,front wheel fell off - less than 2 months old,"We were happy with this model. Scheduling and mapping were great. The parts are easy to clean and the self-emptying dock is great.

BUT - the front wheel just fell off. It still cleans but it can't dock properly."
5,"Listen, hold your breath....can you hear the thundering silence of me not having to vacuum?","Where to start?
With the bad, let us get that right out of the way. The mapping is abysmal, truly, we have run Bruce (if you can name a Shark branded robot vacuum, what other name than Bruce would you choose) 25 times, he is nowhere near mapping our house, compared to my brothers robot from a competitor who rhymes with BOOMBA, which did it in three runs. This Shark does not even play the same sport....this prevents me from doing room specific vacuuming. And that is it. Unless you have a multi story house, where this feature is a must have, set Bruce and he will clean you house. Wonderfully. Next, the not so great, Bruce is so mentally challenged. For a smart device, he is pretty dumb, but you want to know something, Bruce is determined. He will get the job done. He may have to fumble and bumble his way about, but he will get it done, and, if you watch, he does get a little smarter each time, just a little, but it is noticeable. Bruce used to do the house in large, long swaths, now he breaks it into one half of the house, then the other, and just the today, a new feature, he went around the perimeter of the house, cleaning the base boards. Small steps.
As for his vacuum, top notch, perhaps too good. Bit of advice, if you get your own Bruce, run the beast on low suction for at least the first 4 or 5 runs....another con, Bruce does not know when he has eaten too much, and like a greedy guppy, he dies...locks up and cries for help... remember, I told you Bruce is not bright, but he is a work horse. When this happens, you cannot tell Bruce to restart, he has to start over, and hopefully one of Bruce's engineers will fix this, since Bruce will never know how much he has consumed, he has not the ability. Perhaps a command to send him to his base to empty himself, or a shorter duration than the 30 or so minutes it defaults to.
Oh, and the base, the self empty….I am sure robot vacuums before the base were fine, if tedious, since you had to clean them every time….but the base, oh the base is pure genius. Bruce’s base is perfect, we take up with a button, and open it with a button, and never have to touch the refuse. No bag to buy, just push a button, the bottom opens and all that stuff drops out.
If you have not noticed, but this family loves Bruce, we are now looking at getting Bruce a skin, to spruce Bruce up a bit…We have had Bruce for a week now, barely, but already Bruce has made an impact. I absolute honesty I cannot recommend this product enough, it works, it has quirks, but it works, and very well.
Bit of advice
Turn on all your lights until your Bruce gets a good map of the area, he is a camera based robot and needs to “see"" the ceiling, mostly, for landmarks.
Run it on low the first few tries, while Bruce bounces around the first few runs, then move to medium and so on. Remember, Bruce has no sesnor in his bin, he uses a set algorithm that tells him to go back to his base and dump his load. It is terrible. But his vacuum is great, so he gets too full too fast. I can manage it a little for the quality of his cleanup.
Because our house is neither toddler nor robot ready, we did not have all our rooms ready, and so we began mapping with the bedrooms and bathrooms doors closed. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, the mapping is not great, but it does move forward, slowly. Bruce stared being more efficient in our great rooms’ right about the time we added the bedrooms and bathrooms. Our house, 3 bedroom, 2 bath, 2 great rooms and a heart kitchen, Bruce can do it on one charge now, I think because we basically added one room a day after his initial runs.
I think you can tell, Bruce has been a wonderful addition to our home, truly, a robot vacuum was a luxury I didn’t think worked. It works and now I know what gift I will give every new home owner I know. There a lot of options out there, some a lot cheaper, and if those meet your needs, get them, some a lot more expensive, and aside from one specific feature Bruce does not have,( multi floor mapping) I cannot imagine they are better.

UPDATED 2/19/20
Mapping works now, had to delete the map once , run it three times, and bang! house mapped. Room specific vacuuming unlocked! Suggestions to others having issues. Delete the map and ( and I think this part is important) run the vac with every light you can on. The robot ""see"" and makes its map on your ceiling, the more light, the better it see's.
To reiterate, my little robot, Bruce, has literally changed my house...cannot recommend enough.

Updated 2/5/21
A year later and no regrets. One of, if not, the best purchases I have made for my home. I will state again Bruce is an addition to the house and family, he is almost a pet....a very dumb, but very hard working pet....he is like a toddler...he seems to always want to be where you are... He cleans your floors and carpets...If you are on the fence about buying a robot vacuum...let me put you at ease...buy one, this is no longer a luxury to my home, they are a requirement, utterly worth every penny. As for a Shark...I love mine. Works great, does what it is supposed to do. The only house I wouldn't think this is perfect for is multi floor homes. Short of that... a must have.

4/28/23 Still the best purchase we have made for our home cleaning. No change there...but a small observation...recently replaced some furniture and changed the layout of our home. We had to move the dock from a north to south orientation to an east to west...and, I swear, it now navigates even better than before."
5,"Great little robot cleans all our hardwood floors. Great customer service, too.","When my wife and I downsized to a home with about 1000 square feet of living space, we knew we wanted a robot vacuum to keep the 80-year-old white oak floors clean. We wanted four things from our robot: A self-emptying dustbin and charging station, to have it connect to Alexa so we could verbally have her tell the robot to start cleaning, and to be able to tell it to go clean one or more specific rooms.

Roomba and Shark both have systems that can do all those things. We chose this Shark IQ system because there were lots of reviews saying they did a better job on hard floors and because the Shark vacuum is quite a bit less expensive.

We have no regrets. The Shark IQ is a great system for our needs. It will clean all six rooms on our main level and our two small hallways on a single charge, it efficiently navigates its way back to the self-empty charging base to empty its dustbin when it fills up, then returns to where it left off and finishes the job and returns to its base to empty again and recharge.

Alexa integration is pretty good, too. When my wife or I leave for a long walk or to run errands we ask Alexa to, ""Tell Shark to start cleaning,"" then tell her, ""Rosie Jetson"" (the name we gave our Shark), when she asks, ""Which robot?,"" and off Rosie goes. By the time we get back the vacuuming is done. Yay!

Some reviewers have claimed their Shark was not able to map out their home's floorplan. We didn't have that problem. After about a week of cleaning our home Rosie Jetson had mapped our floor plan. Once that was done I spent a few minutes outlining each of our rooms in the Shark Android app, gave the rooms names (kitchen, dining room, etc.), and that was it.

Once our floorplan was entered we could ask Alexa to, ""Tell Shark to clean the kitchen."" Then, after clinging to the left wall of our living and dining room and navigating around our dining room chair legs, Rosie makes it to the kitchen, vacuums, and returns to base. Job done. Awesome!

OK. Now it's time to tell you the sad stuff. Rosie was not our first Shark IQ robot. The first unit we received from Amazon was a refurbished unit, and it was defective. Our first Shark would not connect to our home WiFi, so it could not communicate with Alexa, my smartphone, or map out our floorplan. We called Shark for technical support and, after trying to troubleshoot our robot for 30 minutes, Shark Tech Support declared our original unit dead-on-arrival and sent us a brand-new replacement self-emptying Shark system. The replacement works like a charm and Shark's customer support was excellent.

There are also some things Rosie doesn't do well. She doesn't sweep nto and vaccume all the way into corners and other spaces she can't fit into including a cornet next to our sofa that has an end table with legs that are too close together for her, she gets tangled up in lamp and extension cords (more on that in a moment), we have a set of lightweight nesting occasional tables that she pushes around an inch or two each time she bumps into them,and my wife's tennis shoes, which live under our dresser, get re-arranged and pushed to the back against the wall when she vacuums.

I addressed the problem with lamp and extension cords by buying a cord protector/cover and will build a little wooden square of 1x2 furring strips to put under our dresser so my wife's shoes don't get pushed to the back. Simple fixes, but you should be aware that robot vacuums aren't smart enough (yet) to avoid these shortcomings.

So here's our bottom line: We're really happy with Rosie Jetson, our Shark IQ robot vacuum.

Pros:
* Does a great job of vacuuming our hardwood floors and the carpet mats at our two entries.
* Maps the floorplans and can be told to vacuum a specific room.
* Self empties its own dustbin into the charging base.
* Cleanings can be scheduled using the Shark app.
* Responds to voice commands to ""start cleaning"" via Alexa or Google Home.

Cons:
* Pushes lightweight things around sometimes.
* Cannot clean into corners or tight spaces, so you'll still need to vacuume manually now and them.
* Dirt doesn't just disappear. You have to empty the self-emptying base now and then. You also occasionally need to clean the floor brush, particularly if you have household members with long hair.
* Rosie Jetson, the Robot Maid from the Saturday Morning ""Jetson"" Cartoons I grew up with, could dust, too. Our Shark robot doesn't even try.

Maybe next year, Shark people?"
5,Can't say enough about how awesome this is!,"Let me start by saying I HATED robot vacuums before getting this. I had bought an early model from another brand, and it would randomly run until it hit something turn and repeat. This was basically useless. It never really cleaned, and was constantly stuck, or ran out of batteries before finding its way back to the base. This couldn't be more different.

Setup: I was tentative from the start. But, I told it to start mapping and forgot about it. 15 minutes later I saw it on the base and assumed I never started it or it failed, so I opened the app and saw a highly detailed map of my house. I was amazed. It had mapped and returned to the base so quick I assume it didn't work. I used my phone and assigned room boundaries to the map, put a DO NOT GO zone over the basement stairs to be safe, and setup the app to auto vacuum at 6am on M/W/F.

Running: I have had only one time it needed intervention. It sucked a small cat toy into the roller and detected the strain on the motor and stopped, asked for help. It took about 60 seconds to open the roller, remove it, remove the toy, and put it back together. It resumed the process and finished. I have had it for months and that is the only time I have intervened.

Vacuum quality: Each time I empty the bin I am horrified at the amount of dust and cat hair that it is picking up. It is running 3x a week, and in one week it takes a kitten worth of hair off the hard wood, and enough dust to make you queasy looking at it. It is a powerful vacuum, it gets the entire house when it runs, and does a great job, but it is quiet enough to run without waking anyone up.

Pros: Setup, simple. Set and forget. Empty once a week or two or three. Almost no human intervention required. I don't prep for vacuuming, don't tidy up, don't do anything. It just works and works well. Lidar constantly updating the map, it rarely touches anything, so it doesn't scratch walls and furniture, it uses sensors and lidar to ""see"" the obstacles and work around them.

Cons: It takes a recharge to fully do the house. We work from home and I can't tell it the order to vacuum. So sometimes our offices are the last rooms, and by the time it runs, recharges and starts the second half I am already working and it wants to come vacuum my office. If I could set the order of room vacuuming it would be literally perfect. That is the ONLY con I can possibly think of. Seriously, it is THAT good. I don't know what the $1000+ models can do that this can't."
5,So far so good! *30-day Update* (See below),"I'm no stranger to smart vacs - I have 4 robovacs, two of them self-emptying, mapping robots. My other self-emptying one is a Roomba i3+ (which by now is 3 or 4 year-old tech), so I naturally am comparing this Shark to that one. There's a lot to compare and report on, but I'll just quickly touch on some categories:

- General cleaning power
The Shark seems to be right up there with the Roomba. Suction power and brushing is very similar (even though the Shark has only one brush to the Roombas two), with the Shark having a minor edge in suction power.

- Mapping
The Shark seemed to map my house much faster than the Roomba. It apparently uses its lidar to do so, while the older Roomba had to physically travel over the floor area to include it in the map. The Shark map appears a bit more accurate than the Roomba's.

- Cleaning style
The Shark, like the Roomba, cleans in neat parallel rows, and they both do it well. But the Shark has the advantage of Matrix Cleaning, which covers the area twice - in two directions - and that's a great option. And I also like the spot cleaning option, as well as the ability to set keep-away zones with the Shark.

- Flexibility
Both machines allow the user to direct them to clean certain specified rooms via their apps, and both do it well. The Shark seems to go to rooms faster, while the Roomba has to think about it a lot before proceeding. Both apps are intuitive and work well.

- Noise levels
Sound levels are about the same to my ears, although they sound different. The Roomba has a sucking whine, while the Shark has a slightly rattling sound.

........................

Some negatives for the Shark:

Maintenance - The Shark uses a bagless sytem, whereas my Roomba uses a tidy throwaway bag. While bagless may seem like an advantage, it requires you to clean the dust collection container instead of just pulling out the bag and tossing it. The bag also serves as a filter, meaning that the Shark has to have multiple internal filters (3 in fact), which have to be periodically cleaned or replaced.

Object Avoidance -While it doesn't bang into walls and objects as much as some vacs, it can be too cautious and stop 3-4"" from baseboards, leaving an uncleaned zone along walls. Looks like I'll have to pull out the old upright vac every so often and vacuum the perimeters.

Profile - Its lidar module on top extends higher than on many vacs, making it tend to get stuck on low clearance furniture. It makes a very good effort to avoid these situations, though, so it's not a major issue.

Dock - While it's a lower-profile dock than some vacs, it's also wider, so it takes up more wall area. Leaving the recommended amount of free space on either side is hard to do, so placement might be challenging.

............................

All in all, this Shark self-emptying smart vac is a great tool. At full price it might seem a little pricey, but it's on sale from time to time, and might be worth waiting for a good price. In today's smart vac world it's a solid contender, and it earns all 5 stars from me in spite of some minor shortcomings.

............................

*Update* - I've used the Shark for a month now, and I'm very happy with it. It seems to avoid getting stuck better than all my other vacs, and it has no trouble finding its dock and docking itself like some vacs. I can send it to rooms clear across the house and it just obediently goes there and does its job, then comes back.

Matrix clean is awesome. Cleaning our carpet in one direction and then coming back in the other direction is genius. What it doesn't get going north-south it gets in the east-west direction. It doesn't seem to allow me to select more than one room at a time for matrix, but I can deal with that.

I've been a Roomba fan for years, but this Shark is changing my mind!"
5,Great helper for a bad back. No APP necessary!,"Some basic information that I couldn't find when I was shopping around to choose a robot vacuum: This item, the Shark IQ Robot Vacuum with Self-Empty Base and Wi-Fi Home Mapping is basically two vacuums. There is a robotic vacuum cleaner that travels around cleaning the floor and there is a docking pad where the robot goes to recharge. The docking station has a second, larger vacuum cleaner built into it that removes the waste from the traveling robot. The biggest limitation I can see for this set of vacuums so far is that the instructions call for a clear area around the docking area with three feet to left and right and five feet in front. This is to allow the robot to line itself up properly with the docking station, so it can be successfully emptied. None of this information was particularly prominent on any of the websites I visited and it's sort of important. You might have to rearrange the furniture to make space for this thing. (It's worth it.)

Now, on to the actual review...

Firstly, this vacuum is great if you have back trouble. You don't have to get all the way down on the floor to empty the canister. There is a button at the top of the handle that disconnects it from the base of the docking station, so you can empty it much easier than if you had to bend all the way over to pick up the robot unit. The robot itself is not very heavy, but it is pretty low to the floor. I'm glad I won't have to mess with it very often.

Secondly, I am totally against having unsecured wi-fi connected devices in my home, AND I was concerned about some of the reviews complaining about the APP and the robot's mapping features. Personally, I didn't want to use a stupid APP anyway, so I was happy to find out you can just push the Clean button on the robot with your toe & it'll go clean the whole floor with no app necessary. Unfortunately, the robot has an 'open' wi-fi connection and I wish I could disable that - maybe I'll email customer service about it.

As far as the mapping goes, I have no interest in telling it to only clean one room - I'll just let it do the whole place. I have only had my robot for a day, but it has already learned my 1,000 ft downstairs area. It finds its docking base very easily & it has only been stuck twice, because I underestimated its tenacity and it got past a threshold I thought would stop it. The trick for helping it learn the area is to pick it up if it ever gets stuck and bring it back to the docking station, so it can start over from a location it knows. If you pick it up and put it down a foot away, it will be confused and the internal map will get messed up. Same thing if you move your furniture around - it'll have to relearn the layout of the room every time something gets moved. I have learned to leave it alone for best results. Even if it 'appears' to be lost, it isn't. If you just leave it alone, it'll eventually clean the whole place - it just makes decisions differently than a human being and it's also limited by its battery life. Unless it spouting error messages, just leave it alone. Even if you think it's stuck, don't bother it until it actually stops & gives an error. I watched it get itself into and back out of some pretty weird places under my office chairs. It took about a 103 point turn to get out, but eventually it figured it out.

The robot goes right over thresholds, from carpet to tile and back with no problems at all. It's slightly louder on the tile than the carpet, but it is MUCH quieter than a regular hand-operated vacuum cleaner no matter what surface it's on. I can hear the TV over it without needing to adjust the volume. That's not to say I would want it running right behind the sofa while I'm in the middle of a suspenseful movie, but it means that normal life doesn't have to stop just because the vacuum is going. I can continue doing whatever I want, while the robot works around me. The vacuum of the base unit is much louder than the robot itself, but it only lasts for a few seconds.

As far as cleaning power, this is not a Bissel nor a classic Rainbo vacuum that can pick up a bowling ball - it's a lightweight vacuum, just like any other. If you're a cement worker, it's probably not going to do the job for you. However, in my thoroughly cattified home, it has been doing a great job. It picks up Swheat Scoop litter that my cats track all over (so gross). It grabs dust bunnies from under the edge of the sofa, and it does NOT try to eat cat toys or shoes. I was just as impressed by the things this vacuum doesn't try to pick up as I am with the things it does. It's smart enough not to eat cat toys. Great!

After doing the math for the cost of a cleaning company, and considering how much it hurts to vacuum manually, I figure this robot has already paid for itself, and it's only been one day. Personally, I don't care if other reviews say it ""isn't as good"" as the Roomba. I didn't want to risk fifteen hundred bucks. I am glad I didn't, because this Shark is perfectly serviceable. It's well designed, reasonably 'smart', reasonably quiet, picks up the types of dirt present in my home, and seems sturdily built. So far, I am extremely happy with it! Now, I don't have to choose between a dirty floor or a terrible back ache from using the regular vacuum cleaner. What a relief!"
5,Best purchase for our home so far,"Since we bought this in late November, which I suggest getting since it was newely half off its retail price of 600 (gotta love black Friday), I have only had to get out the old vacuum once. I was worried that we would have to get it out more than that to get under our cabinets in the kitchen, but that is luckily not a problem. If I see something under there now I just push it to the middle of the floor if I know shark is going to clean that day.

So here we go...

Pros:
-it literally cleans about 95% of your floors. Hair is not a problem, tangling on the roller is not a problem, larger debris is generally not a problem (I had some things here and there get missed the first go around, but I mostly see that it has problems on carpets, which we have mostly hardwood floors so not a big deal).
-it mapped out our first floor, which is sizeable, in about 2 go cleanings. I was worried about this as a large amount of reviews stated that it took 30 or more cleanings to map their house out and it still didn't map it correctly. The one thing I noticed about these reviews is that they are mostly from from a year ago, so I'm assuming that there has been a software update since then to address this issue. It was super efficient at mapping.
- I see this as a pro, but some might not, is that it teaches you to adjust your cleanliness behaviors. You need to keep the floors free of obstacles (as much as possible) in order for this robot to do its job, which means moving your shoes, picking up toys, moving chairs, etc. It was good for my wife and i to adapt better habits anyway and this was a good way to Kickstart that for our household.
- if you have allergies, this thing picks up a ton of dust. Since we don't have a pet (yet) it mostly picks up some food, hair and dust on the floor. Man does it help. My allergies have been much better over the past 2 months.
- some people gave the app negative reviews, but I found it helpful overall. It is simple, easy and quick to make adjustments on.
-you really don't have to empty this but once a month. And, honestly, I could get away with maybe once every 2 months instead. Don't forget to do a monthly maintenance check and clean the filter, but this is a 5 minute routine once a month. Much easier than busting out the bulky vacuum all the time.

CONS
-speaking of the app, it needs a no go zone feature. The magnet strips, while great, don't effectively help in managing the bots path all the time. Make sure to tape it or use 3m sticky stuff to keep it on the floor otherwise your bot will try to suck it up and take it for a ride with it. The no go zone feature would be helpful for wire areas, furniture, or kid play areas. I hear it is supposed to come along sometime in the future, hopefully soon.
-carpet cleaning is a little bit of an issue. We have a giant area rug in our living room and it sometimes has issues with picking up stuff. Luckily, the bot does 2 or 3 sweeps, which most times gets the debris or fuzzies on our carpet, but not all the time. This is indicated on YouTube reviews that I watched before I purchased this, so I knew what to expect.
-it is slightly noisy and takes a while to clean. I advise to make the schedule while you are not home, because it can change your daily routine pattern. Generally, it takes about an hour and a half to clean our 600 square foot first floor. I keep it on normal mode, but there is a higher power suction mode that is louder. So get ready to turn the volume up on your TV. I did hear from a roomba user though that this bot is quieter, so I guess it's subjective.
-this is more if a personal gripe, it might not be a big deal for you, but I was hoping to have a meet the Jetsons vibe when I connected it to my alexa. I wanted to say ""alexa, clean the kitchen"" and it do just that. Unfortunately, it doesn't do different room commands, it just does its normal full routine. You can do this through the shark app, which is simple and easy enough. So designate room names and tell it to clean just that room. Still, if you have a kitchen mess and you want to use verbal commands through alexa skills to do something while you are continuing chores or cooking, it would be a nice touch if it did it. Oh well, that's just me.

Overall a great purchase. Currently, I got mine for roughly 315 and I am doing monthly payments with Amazon, which I love this feature of Amazon's payments. I pay it off in March in monthly installments of 64 bucks. It is worth the money compared to those roombas that cause double or triple the shark bot. I did a ton of research on different vacuums and this one is in the top 5 (as of right now). I highly recommend this to anyone with similar lay out as us (mostly hard wood floors with area rugs). I found the cons to be just nit picking at its performance, and overall it makes our life 80x easier. I give it a 4.5 out 5 for my personal home and I hope this review was helpful.

1 year update:

Dog hair: Still going strong and still highly recommend for those with mostly hard wood floors or linoleum. In fact, I recommended it to my mom and dad and now they have one and love it. We did finally get to test it with some serious dog hair. We had an Australian Shepard (which has super thick and clingy fur) and another dog that visited for several days. Both are extremely active and were all over our floors and our one carpet area. They left a ton of fur and it did take 3 or 4 cleanings to get up about 80% of the hair. Whatever was left over was bunched up on the carpet and was easily removable thanks to shark. Just be prepared to wait a few days for the fur to be cleaned up in the carpet. If it's hardwood then it is cleaned up instantly.

Hair and roller blade: I have not had any issues with the roller blades and hair tangling. I had to untangle some hair that rolled to the center twice. It is an easy fix. Take scissors and a quick snip and boom solved the problem. The big thing is that it doesn't hinder the cleaning ability of the vacuum.

Parts: I haven't had to replace any of the parts yet on it. Just keep up with monthly maintenance and it will hold up. Clean the filters and the dust cup monthly and it will run smoothly. The battery life is still the same too. No issues with battery degradation.

Errors and software stuff: so the errors are minor with this robot. It is the occasional bumper is stuck and that the dust cup needs to be emptied, which is nice if you forget to keep up with maintenance. The only issue I have with the software is that it used to be able to clean specific rooms when I originally got it, but now it doesn't allow me to do that at all. It's a bummer since sometimes I still stuff in the kitchen and I just want it to do that room, not an entire cleaning again. Also, and this is a small gripe, but I wish that I could have the robot automatically go to max suction mode every cleaning. Instead, I have to go to my shark app on my phone and change it from normal mode (which is its default cleaning mode) to max.

Overall, I would still say this is a 4.5 out of 5. Minor issues, but still totally worth it."
5,Proof is in the Pudding!,"I don’t normally write a lot of reviews, but when I take the time to write one, it exceeded my expectations. This is no different. As many have probably done, I picked this up on sale. And with the 10% cash back on the prime card, it was an easy decision. I’ve researched these for years, but the tech never felt “ready” yet. For me, the wait is over. The setup out of the box was simple, and it did’t take long for the unit to map our house. After mapping, you can clean the whole house, or select which rooms. I watched it for its first mission. I was amazed how it reached every crevasse. It really tries hard to reach each corner, and my experience is that it did just that. At times, it looked like it missed some areas, but it reached every section before returning to the base. Others commented on how it’s not as loud as other units. Definitely quieter than a standard vacuum. We have pets, so you can select a setting to return to the base to empty every 30 minutes. It then returns to the exact location to resume. If it’s cleaning, and the battery is running low, it will return to the base to charge up, then it returns to where it left off. When evacuating the robot, that’s the loudest part, but the base has a hepa filter to avoid the dirt causing odor, or re-entering your floors. The receptacle releases from the base with the push of a button, then one little switch to dump in the trash. Take a look at the pic. That was from only 2 rooms. It was able to easily navigate under the bed, which is always hard to clean. If you have pets, this is a must have. Outside of just turning it on to clean your floors, you can schedule your cleanings daily while you’re away. Nothing like coming home to see clean floors, and the robot back on it’s base charging, and see the trash it picked up through the little peephole. I also linked it to Alexa. Another cool feature is naming the robot. We named ours “Karen”. If you’ve ever watched SpongeBob, you’ll know why. 😀. If an area in your house has an immediate cleaning need, you can say, “Alexa, ask Karen to clean the Kitchen”, then off she goes. Easier than getting a broom or vacuum for sure, and don’t have to leave your couch. Probably not good for exercise, but for someone with mobility issues, I see this as mandatory. It even has a “spot-clean” feature. For high traffic areas that need extra attention, you can select spot-clean on the app, zoom into the area on the map your robot outlined, then off she goes to only clean the section you zoomed in on. Pretty cool. I’ve seen older versions operate, and I was never impressed. I’m glad I took the plunge with this Shark Unit. If you’re on the fence like I was for years, this is your unit (Especially if on sale again). My thought was, if it didn’t get the amount of pet hair I would expect, I would return it. Well, that’s not going to happen. Karen is now part of the family, and we’re considering bringing in a brother or sister to mop the floors. I’ll be researching what Shark has in this arena, you can believe that. Well done, Shark. Well done."
5,I'm pretty happy with the performance in the first few weeks.,"I haven't had this very long but I bought it to replace an iRobot S9 Plus that I bought and returned because it would not manage my tile carpets. This little shark can get over anything. It avoids obstacles, and has not had any trouble except for one small light clothing item that got sucked into the wheel and brush. The vacuum signaled me on my phone that I was having a problem, beeped to tell me where it was, and after I removed the clothing item, it knew where it was and was able to return to the base for a charge, then continue vacuuming. The base is bagless so it's easy to grab it, walk over to the garbage, and tip the dust out. I'm using a program to have it start a couple mornings a week, and another couple of programs to start in the day and evening when we are typically not in the house. It handles leaving chairs and other obstacles around fine, knowing that it's not going to vacuum under a spot if we have a big box or something like that. We happen to be vacuuming four times a week. That's adequate. Maybe we could get by with less, but since we don't have to think about it, we just let it do its thing. I realize we're still fairly new owners of the shark, but so far I'm pretty happy. The app seems to work well. The robot made a good map of the house on the first try. Setting up zones and rooms was pretty straightforward. If you have really odd shaped areas, you can make them by creating multiple rectangles, including some at angles if needed, and merging them. We haven't created any no-go zones, but that seems to be a pretty straightforward process also. If we don't want it to go into a space, we just don't select that space when we create the job."
5,This is a game changer!,"I've had several robotic vacuums over the past ~15yrs. The others are simply toys compared to the R101AE. It just 'works'. I know. Amazing. A consumer product that does what its manufacturer claims it will do but, it seriously does!

When I saw the self-empty option was available (Shark Infomercial), I went out to the site to check out the specs. It was just so quiet in the videos. There had to be some trickery going on. Robot vacuums are loud, clunky and slam into things constantly. At least that is what I had come to expect from vacuum products from a certain robotics company. Prior to getting the R101AE, I would either have to suffer through a very loud robot cleaning vacuum session to get mediocre results or if I was brave, start the cleaning process, leave the house and NOT enable my alarm. You see, my previous robot vacuums would set off my alarm banging into things and just generally being obnoxiously loud in general.

Say hello to the Shark IQ R101AE (specifically: I have the R1001AE). Its a game changer! Being the inpatient type, I had pre-installed the app on my phone and waited anxiously for the robot to be delivered. I unboxed it, took off the protective wrap, placed it on the charger for a good 20 seconds before starting the setup process. I got it connected to wifi, scanned its code, enabled the 'Recharge and Resume' and 'Evacuate and Resume' features, set it up with my Alexa and Google Home, and then sat and stared at the robot - consciously willing the battery to charge!

""Alexa, ask Shark the status of Sharky...""
""Your robot is at its dock and has 45% battery.""

OK. I've been patient enough. Time to see thing in action! Mixing things up a little, I used the app to tell the robot to start cleaning. I thought for a moment that something must be wrong. It doesn't sound like the vacuum is running. But, it was working. Placing my hand along the left side of the robot, I could feel an impressive amount of exhaust air blowing at a slightly upward angle. Nice Job Shark! Vent upwards so you don't blow dirt and dust around in areas that haven't been cleaned yet.

The robot started awkwardly finding its way around my house - in nice North/South lines. It ran for about 30 mins when I saw the battery light turn red. It was physically only about 10ft from the base but, it was blocked by a couch and loveseat configured in an ""L' shape with the base being at on the other side (outside) of the ""L' where the horizontal and vertical lines meet. This was going to be interesting.

The bot tried its best to squeeze through the slightly-too-small gap between the couch and loveseat. It could 'see' the base. It just couldn't get to it! Drat! Well, after a moment, it turned off its vacuum and turned around and started in the opposite direction. Low and behold, it drove out of the ""L"" trap, made half a lap around the dining-room table and then made a bee-line towards the base.

It lined up and backed itself into the base. A few seconds later, it self-emptied into the base. I thought, thats a useless exercise. I had run my other robot vacuum only an hour or so before the Shark IQ arrived. The floors were already clean. Well, apparently not! It had picked up an impressive amount of stuff that the bot from that robotics company had missed! Nice!

I sat down and turned on the TV, knowing that the bot needed to charge for a while - hoping that the 'resume' feature worked as advertised. A while later, engrossed in some prime-time thriller on TV, (that's code for asleep on the couch) I was startled when the bot bumped into my foot that was dangling off the couch.

Not only had it resumed but, it had come right back to the spot it had left off at... It was obvious that some 'Ninja' had also been added to the design because although I am an extremely light sleeper, it had managed to sneak up on me! It really is that quiet!

Today is day #2 with the bot. When I got up this morning, I asked Google Home what the status of the bot was and when it responded it was on its base with 100% battery, I told it to start cleaning. I just want to accelerate the mapping process.

The bot cleaned for about 30mins, returned to base and emptied, resumed cleaning for another ~50mins, returned to base to empty and charge, resumed cleaning for another 50mins and returned to base to empty and recharge, declaring the job complete. I checked the app and although it says the map is not complete, it has covered 100% of the area I expect it to cover.

It was impressive to watch it delicately navigate its way through the maze of chair and table legs to clean under every chair at the table in a very methodical manner. It did the same thing with the bar stools, coffee tables and end tables. There was no slamming into furniture, no getting stuck at the fireplace threshold, no getting lost at some random corner of the house and giving up on life itself. It just works! This is a game changer!"
5,Carson !,"We’ve had Carson, (had to give it a name) a month now and it’s performing way above expectations.

Setting up was easy. We worked out the best and most out of the way place its base would be situated and then we just followed the clear setup instructions.

Carson did his mapping and we ensured prior to that we had as much stuff off the floor as possible in order for as complete as possible mapping of our home would be done. It’s something I’d highly recommend be done before it’s sent out to map.

Carson we have scheduled to clean three times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Every Monday we remove as much stuff off the floor as possible so we get a thorough clean. Especially after the weekend.

We are amazed how much dust and hair is collected when we empty the base station each week. Our floors have never looked cleaner. We have hardwood floors with some area mats. We also have a dog that sheds a lot and no longer do we find a tumbleweed of dog hair lurking along the skirting.

As the main level of our property is 1500sq ft Carson does have to go and recharge for a few hours ( you can opt to turn this off ) half way through, but it’s no drama. We also have it periodically empty itself during the cleaning process which only takes a matter of a few minutes.

We purchased a few spares just in case but we do clean the filters each week to ensure maximum efficiency.

The noise level is minimal and not a problem. The dog whilst scared of it at first has no issues with it now.

Things we would like to see improved with Carson
1 It could be slightly shorter to enable it to get under more units.

2 More brushes, there are two, might be better if four. But I’m sure the designers would have looked into thar.

3 The scheduling in the app could be better. You can only schedule it once a day. Whilst it can be sent out to clean separately via the app it would be nice to have a few more scheduling options.

4 We take it to the other floors on the house where it does its own thing, and it does a good job but it doesn’t map the floor areas on those levels or generate a report for those areas. It would be good if it could generate a report and produce a map not just for the main level. It does however let you know when it’s completed the clean of those areas so we can go and take it back to the base station.

Overall we are delighted with Carson and we highly recommend it. Our home is a lot cleaner as a result."
5,Very Pleased! Works much better than expected.,"[update May 18, 2024] I'm even more pleased after Buddy has been on the job for six months. He's just a joy to have around. Yes, he has a name now. Buddy has gotten stuck no more than four times while cleaning at least part of the house every few days. I'm still amazed at how much stuff (mostly cat fur) is in the base station when I check it every month or two, because to me the house looks like it's mostly clean all the time now so I don't expect that much ""invisible"" debris to be collected.

The self-cleaning brush roller isn't completely maintenance free, but I never expected it would be. The worst culprit isn't the cats, but my wife's hair. Fortunately it's extremely easy to pop the roller out and untangle the stuff, which I do about once per month. You can hear when it needs a cleaning.

The only thing I really wish for is a single-room learning update. No way I want to update the whole house again, but there are one or two small pockets where Buddy just doesn't go. I'd like to be able to update just that one room without having to re-learn the whole house.

But, I have to say, this is one of the most unexpectedly satisfying purchases I've made ever.

[original review]
I can't compare this robot vacuum to any others because it's my first. I will say that I didn't expect it to work as well as it does. We have two rag doll cats that put out an amazing amount of fur. It's either vacuum all the time or just put up with it between vacuuming. Not any more! Sure, it can't get everywhere the fur likes to go hide, but surprisingly, it does get most of it.

We have wood floors with area rugs. I was afraid it would choke on the thicker area rugs. They're a pain to do even with a regular vacuum, but it handles them like a champ! It's so refreshing to see the floors so tidy. I'm embarrassed at what we put up with before. Another nice thing is if I make a mess, such as in the kitchen, I no longer care. I just whip out the phone and order up a room cleaning.

Now for the big advice. Spend as much time as needed getting the initial exploration, map, and room creation process as perfect as possible. Move everything you can out of the way so it doesn't mistake something like a bathroom scale as part of the house geometry. After the first few tries, there were areas it just decided weren't part of the house because it couldn't get there when exploring. It simply wouldn't clean there even if not obstructed! Once I went through the house thoroughly and got everything I could out of the way, it made an excellent map. When you put things back, the map will remain but those things will just be seen as temporary obstacles. Seriously. It's worth the work.

My biggest ask for improvement would be single-room learning. After going to all this trouble getting a good map, I really don't want to re-learn the whole house if I, say, rearrange the furniture in one room. But for now that's not an issue. I initially took off a star for these initial shortcomings but have put it back up to five stars. Overall it's fine.

I can't say for sure, but I think it's getting smarter. For sure, it hugs the walls really well now, where it wasn't doing that before. The only downside is I can't say this thing is saving me any real time yet because I end up following it around the house just to watch. lol!"
5,Great vacuum system,"I was skeptical about the vacuum’s mapping but let it try several times and it did a great job. I even moved it to test its ability to be put in a closet. I was very happy when it mapped the house again and could go back to home with about an inch on either side while going to home in the closet. See Image ( The manual indicates it needs much more room but I didn’t like it out in the open)
The vacuum really helps keep the dog hair and kid dirt down.
We have had it over a year and I would still buy it today."
5,LOVE this Shark Vac,"OMG!!! #1 I’m a first time home owner so of course I had to ask multiple people about the robo vacs they have in their home.. I must say I LOVE THIS VACUUM!!! I’ve read all the reviews and need to say I’ve had zero issues with this vac. It mapped my house perfectly in one run. I was even able to customize the map and block off the stairs since I have a bi level home and was afraid it would fall down the stairs. This little bot does an amazing job!! It goes back to the dock when it’s full and empties out and goes right back to the spot it left off at and continues cleaning. I have to mention I have all hardwood floors and no pets (yet) so it may be a little different for others. I also have small rugs all around my home and in my bathrooms and I’ve had no issues with it getting stuck or trapped on them. The battery doesn’t die like some have complained about but again I’ve also only had it for about a month so I can’t speak too much on that. Overall great investment, the AI mapping is great, it’s super quiet and very efficient. Pls note I’m a paying customer, no sponsors and I was not paid to leave this review."
5,A major game changer!,"It’s wonderful. It has changed my life completely! I have always been very picky about my floors and I realize now it was my biggest stress annoyance and time sucker I was constantly vacuuming and sweeping. It was never done and always needed to be done. Not now I feel like I hired a maid! My floors are clean all the time. It has taken one huge load off of me! It’s amazing how I can be at work and push a button for my phone and it will vacuum my whole house while I’m gone. I come home to clean. But I tell you I just love the things so most of the time I have run while I’m home. It’s still so amazing to me this robot vacuum. It’s very easy to use once you have it set up and it maps out your house. It sees itself, which is the coolest thing. If I were to say one negative about it is when it does empty itself out it does smell of dust in the air for about 15 seconds or so. It doesn’t smell good and I don’t like it but oh my God it’s my new issue compared to what it does for me my life. Once again it’s a game changer of quality it does not mop, which is what I thought it did first, but now I’m kind of glad that it doesn’t because I have found throughout the years that if you get a machine that does more than one thing that complicates things and they’re more app to break one thing cleans the floors and it does very well I hope it lasts forever !"
5,WAAAAY better than my *never* vacuuming! There's no going back.,"This is a robot vacuum cleaner. It is not and will not be as good as my canister vacuum. However, I used that vacuum about as frequently as I had guests over and in 2020 that dropped to 0, as the time I spent on my carpet doing yoga increased drastically. As a result I decided to take the plunge and I LOVE my bot vac.

FACTS ABOUT MY USE
- I have three short-hair cats
- I have a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house with some spare rooms
- My house is ""2 stories"" with some other weird levels
- I have primarily carpet, but some tile, some laminate, and some sheet vinyl

QUIRKS/TIPS
- The errors don't always make sense. The ""something stuck underneath me"" error is the most common red herring. Look at the tutorials for cleaning the front wheel (you have to pry it out of the little case), and the main brush (it doesn't get super tangled with hair on the middle, but pet hair does get stuck at each end.
- The mapping feature really does just take a bunch of patience and not paying attention. Let it run several times and the map will eventually sort itself out. My bot vac still does some weird patterns on the floor... so I just imagine it's training for the bot-vac olympics floor routine and those unusual paths are worth bonus points.
- For me, a dense dusty buildup (gross, right?) started to accrue on the short bristles of the main roller so that then they didn't move like independent bristles. And then I noticed it wasn't as good at picking up pet hair. I combed that off of the bristles and it's unsurprisingly much better at picking up pet hair.
- It's pretty dang good at regular cleanup if you take care of it (I do a quick clear-out of the brushes and dust bin after each run, it's pretty darn easy), but it's not stellar at corners and edges especially if you vacuum as infrequently as I do/did. So I got my canister vacuum out and cleaned the edges and corners. No biggie!

MY COUPLE OF GRIPES
- My map randomly deleted itself one day? I was annoyed because I'd set up some very clever no-go zones that I was pleased with. The bot vac did, however, remember the automatic schedule. Go figure? This was frustrating but again... the bot vac cleans my floors twice a week. It's worth a weird map glitch to me.
- One of the latches that you pinch together to hold the dust bin in place is now kinda sticky and doesn't pop back into place. I wiggle it to get it to re-latch. Annoying but again... not the worst fate ever

NIFTY FACTS/FAVORITE THINGS
- You can have a map of the main floor you use this on (near the docking station) but you can ALSO then pick up the bot vac and take it to another floor or a room that you don't want cleaned on the regular and it'll clean that without forgetting the main map (see above for map-related oddities... unrelated to moving the bot vac). It just returns to where it starts and then sends you a sad message that it can't find the dock until you pick it up and take it back
- This isn't a feature of the vacuum so much as it a bonus side-effect of the automated schedule. I keep the floors in the main area much tidier now then I used to because I know the vacuum runs twice a week and I don't want to have to quickly dash over and pick stuff up so the vacuum has free reign
- THE BAGLESS COLLECTOR IS AWESOME. It is so nice not to have to deal with the consumable bags from my canister vacuum, and to not have to worry that it'll fill up if I don't empty it all the time!

I've had this now since early December 2020, cleans are scheduled twice a week, and once each week I carry the vacuum to the upstairs or the back room to run, so plenty of cycles, plenty of square feet, and so far so good!

I am SOOOOOOOOOO glad I finally got my bot vac and once I worked through some of the quirks, I am very happy with it!"
5,"Five Stars for the vacuum, no stars for the Cleaning App","This is a follow-up review of the Shark IQ Robot Self Empty XL RV 1001AE Vacuum ( 3 months review)

Follow-Up Review -3 months later

The vacuum itself has earned 5 stars. I have used it almost every day in the past three months and it has been up to the challenge presented by three pets and two humans. The floors have never been so clean and the unit is much quieter than the previous iRoombas that we had. I will definitely buy another unit when this one wears out. However, that being said, we have found the Cleaning App to be useless.

Cleaning App- useless

For us, the cleaning App has been useless. We programmed our router to only have 2.4 GHZ WiFi into the house so we know that is not the problem. The ONLY way to have the unit communicate with the iPhone or iPad is to unplug and plug in the router, which causes a reboot. At that point, the unit and iPad communicate just fine for TWO RUNS and then communication is once again lost. What this means is that I must physically push the clean button on the unit and it will then proceed to clean the entire house. I have used the recommended metal tape for no-go zones. It cleans for 30 minutes, empties and resumes cleaning. After this cycle has repeated three times, it recharges and finishes cleaning the house. It would be nice to have the option of selective room cleaning and scheduling, but, without the App, that doesn't happen. Consulting the non-existent technical support is not an option. Hope this helps people in their decision about buying this product.
We bought this unit from Amazon on Dec. 24th, 2020 and it was delivered on Dec. 28th, 2020. In summary, a great product but with zero manufacturer support.
PROS:
• Unit is very quiet.
• Self-empty feature is great.
• Good You-Tube videos on set-up and use.
• Price is 1/3 to 1/ 2 of similar iRooma unit.
• Two ways to mark off no-go areas: lay down non-adhesive magnetic ribbon or program no-go areas through the Shark Clean App.
CONS:
• Horrible manufacturer customer service. (This is the Shark Customer Service, NOT that of Amazon, which is very good.)
• I was told Shark does not have any U.S. representatives. The people I did speak with were difficult to understand and simply read from scripts. After spending quite a bit of time taking down my information in order to register the unit, they said they were sorry, but due to technical difficulties at their end, they were unable to register the device.
• If you have any problems, don’t expect any help from Shark Customer Service. You are on your own!
• App is unstable. System keeps losing contact with network after a few days. None of the nine troubleshooting protocols listed on the app ever worked.
• The only solution that I figured out is to delete robot from app and start over as if it is a new robot. The problem with this strategy is that all of the maps, which took several cleaning trips to create, seem to be lost. For some reason, after the robot had cleaned the entire house, without a map, the old maps reappeared. The device seems to lose communication with the app after a few days. This has happened twice, now.
Overall Review: Such a promising product but clobbered by non-existent Sharp customer service. I am quite tech-savvy and actually told THEM about my work-around as it wasn’t listed on any of their protocols. I suspect the main issue is that the app and/or the device needs to be reprogrammed to accept 5 GHz Internet, which is quickly becoming the standard in many places. Right now, the app is restricted to 2.4 GHz. My Spectrum service says it can do both frequencies of 5 and 2.4 GHz, which may account for the app’s instability. You really do need the app to avail yourself of the great features like no-go zones and selective room cleaning. The Amazon representative did her best to rectify the situation, so no complaints with Amazon, but, unfortunately, the problem lies with Shark. I will post another review in two weeks to say whether we decide to keep the unit or not."
5,Pros and cons,"I bought this so it could keep our floors clean between weekly vacuuming sessions. With 2 kids, 1 dog and 2 kittens, our floors are constantly in need of cleaning. It does really well with crumbs and hair and fur and even picks up Legos, friendship bracelets, litter, winter salt, etc. I do need to empty the bin at least 1x a week and at least 1x a week I get a notification from the app that something is stuck in the dust bin and it’s preventing it from fully emptying itself. Usually it’s something big like a Lego. I will say it takes WAY longer to clean the areas of the house I want it to. It usually takes at least 3-4 hours to clean around 900 square feet. In that time it has to travel back and forth to empty itself every 30 mins and then will sit on the charger for a while to recharge, as it cannot do the full 900 square feet without charging. It also waits to get back to 100% before continuing, which means it takes longer to charge. It does get itself caught under our couches so I have to put things in front of them so it doesn’t go under them. I refuse to stick down the barrier strips because they have to be stuck there permanently and I don’t want them on any of my floors. It doesn’t have any trouble with the top of the stairs, it does detect it and doesn’t go down the steps. We have an area rug which has permanently rolled up sides and it does well getting over those too. I have seen it go over clumps of dog hair without picking it up, which is weird since it picks up Legos. I do like that it goes row by row so it covers an entire area. I don’t like that it misses things like the aforementioned pet hair. I also hoped that the app would let me send it to one area of the house to clean it - namely the room the litter boxes are in. However, every single time the robot runs it re-maps your house. You can see the history of where it cleaned and that also means seeing where it did NOT. So when I check the map a lot of times entire rooms are missing (like the room I want the litter cleaned, or the kitchen floor) or only partial rooms show up. Half the time I get sick of it and delete the entire map so it had to remap the house again and hope it gets to more areas. It is nice to be able to send it out to clean even if I’m not home, but I haven’t done that very often as I usually have to do a quick scan for toys, etc before letting it loose. I’ve also learned I have to flip it over and open up the compartment where the brush roller is housed - there will be so much hair/fur where the roller brackets are attached that it slows down or fully stops the roller. Once I pop the roller off I can remove the clumps at both ends and then pop back together quickly, but just another thing to think about. All in all I’m glad to have it, it does a mostly good job on the areas it does hit, leaving very satisfying vacuum lines and giving us some sort of baseline of clean before the weekend when the big vacuum is used, but it takes way longer than I expected, and the problems with the map/sending it to a specific area to clean bum me out with the money I paid. Oh! I will say if you ever have to call customer service with a problem, they are really helpful in getting the issue resolved."
5,Worth it. Wish I bought the one that mops.,"Been keeping our hardwood clean for 6 months now.

⭐It has a very intuitive app that goes along with it. After it maps your house, the app displays a diagram of what exactly it managed to scan. Kinda scary how accurately this robot can see.
But its neat because after it scans the house, you can section off individual rooms and have the robot vacuum them individually through the app.
You can also set a 3'×3' area through the app whenever a small accident happens, which I never use since its easier and much quicker to just grab a broom. But people who are physically disadvantaged would definitely appreciate that feature.
⭐You can schedule times for the robot through the app. Ours turns on everyday after everyone goes to work. Takes about 6 hours to clean the entire house, stopping only for an hour to recharge before finishing for the day. Empties itself out at its charging station about 5 times before needing to recharge.
⭐Doesnt bother our pitbull or yorkie. It doesn't use an actual vacuum, it uses brushes to sweep things up, so the dogs dont really care much when they see this things in motion. They'll nibble on it when it sneaks up on them however.
⭐Has 3 modes you can activate through the app. The powerful mode has woken me up several times, a few of which I was irritated enough to get up and press the home button. But the eco mode is easy enough to sleep through. Can't really tell if the power mode is any different than the eco mode in terms of cleaning power.
🤷‍♂️It speaks several languages, which can be changed using the app. Which isnt really practical in anyway because it only speaks when you give a command through the app or when it gets stuck.
⭐Notifies your phone when it has a problem. So when you're at work it will let you know when it sucks on a shower mat.
❌Its a hit or miss with rugs. With heavier and flat rugs its fine, but expect an occasional hiccup with rugs that are thin, fuzzy, decorative, or just dont stick to the ground well.
⭐It has about a 1.5"" clearance from the ground. If you have any transitioning trim in between rooms then you dont have to worry about the robot struggling to climb over.
❌ Recharge station is loud when the robot goes to empty out, you can hear it from several rooms over. Probably wont be a problem for most people, however for graveyard shift workers it might be annoying if you set it up nearby where you sleep.
❌I recommend buying a spare parts kit as along with your Shark. It doesnt come with enough.
⭐ Maintenance and part replacement is easy. No tools needed to remove panels, replace brushes and filters. All panels are marked and give instructions on how to open them. You can easily clean out the robot and replace filters/brushes in less than a minute. Emptying out the recharge station is easy too, although hopefully you're okay with using your hand to do that part.
❓As for frequency of maintenance, Ive untangled enough hairs to say that it happens quite a bit. However, its never really a hassle, takes only a few minutes at most. Mysteriously lost a few brushes as well, probably got sucked up by the robot. Im the type to enjoy it though.
🤷‍♂️ This robot doesnt totally clean perfectly, however it does enough to make you realize that you havent swept in weeks.

Its pretty much like having a pet that pays for itself, by giving you minutes of your life back that you otherwise would be sweeping. We called ours Wonton, and he earned his place in our house. Hardest working roommate we got."
5,Entertaining and super functional!,"Alright, so this is my first VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Location and Mapping) robotic vacuum. Usually when i see ""shark"" i see ""as seen on tv/beware"". That being said, this guy works super well! Right out of the box, it picked out the direction of the walls and started running running lawnmower stripes on the carpet. Cleaning is great, i've so far run on Eco and Normal suction, have yet to try full power, but results are great. This thing's gotten into nooks and crannies i did not expect it to cover with very few missed spots. The only gripe about actual cleaning that I have is the device's tenacity towards missed spots. There's a fireplace in my house with a raise stone surface just in front of the mouth of the fireplace with an angled wooden trim surrounding. This is raised just enough so the section that is on carpet is marginally low enough for the robot to get onto in the right instance, and the section adjacent to a wooden floor is too high, causing the machine to loudly hump the stone for a few minutes as it backs off, look for another way to the spot, and fail/succeed. Also of note is the general noise. Because of Shark's de-tangle system, there's a clicking noise in time with the brush spinning.

The base and charge-and-resume functions are also incredibly cool. I put my base on the pad in a carpeted living room, and the shark reliably finds home, drives up, pulls a 180 and backs in. The vacuum base is pretty slick, and takes about 8-10s to clean out the bot, which it does twice in a cleaning cycle for me, once at the 30 min mark to empty the bin, and once when its been running for an hour to re-charge. The resume was a tad annoying the first time I ran it however, as the machine had previously been run around 5pm, and stopped its run at 6. By the time it recharged at 10pm, it was ready to go back to humping the fireplace, which would have been nice to have known in the app. And yes, a full battery charge takes roughly 4 hours, which is fine. While LI-ION batteries should be able to charge faster, a slower charge will preserve functionality.

On the software side of things, the app is nothing to write home about. It works fine, but you have to refresh the app (close and open) to get data to update sometimes, like charge percents. A refresh button would be nice for those of us sitting there watching the battery charge.. Get used to the little GIF of the shark bot making three passes, and the circular loading icon. Even with a Note 8, it still takes about 10s for initial load. The thing definitely knows where its going, but it takes a while to draw the map! So far i'm on run number 4, and its at 20% drawn, though the history gives me a very accurate idea of where it has been. As for scheduling, it works, and it will start exactly when you ask. the bot will run for an hour and stop, and as far as i can tell, you can't change how long it runs for. You also can't change power levels for scheduled cleanings, only while the cleaning is occuring, which is a huge gripe. I'd love to be able to tell it to clean the carpeted rooms in the house with extra power, but i'd have to be watching the app from home to do that.

If you're buying this for the Alexa integration, don't! Its just a skill. so you can tell Alexa to make the shark start, stop, and go to base, but thats about it. Grouping via the Alexa app, to turn on the applicable lights when the robot is out of the dock? nope. Scheduling via Alexa? nope. I don't have mapping done yet, but i could assume telling alexa to ask the shark to clean a certain room doesn't exist.

So yeah, the robot does a great job at cleaning, the base does its thing well, but the app is meh, and alexa integration is a joke. If you don't have a smart home and want a robot that cleans well without having to disassemble the bot daily, this is a good contender.

Pro/con list:
+Great cleaning
+VSLAM works great,
+Vacuum base is awesome
+finds home and docks reliably
+App allows you to control bot from anywhere
+maps of cleaned area even before an official map is generated
Battery life of 60-90 minutes
four hour charging
a little noisy, audible clicking
-lack of scheduling options
-amazon Alexa integration is a joke
-app takes a while to load, close/open sometimes faster than waiting for charge and status data to update"
5,Happy feet!,"I love this robot vacuum! We had an early roomba model, but haven’t used it much because 1) we were victims of a dog poop incident and 2) our floors are never clear enough to run it. We are a neurodivergent family and it’s always a mess, but we also have lots of sensory sensitivities, and feeling all the dirt on the floor is torture.

I recently deep cleaned the house and I’m trying really hard to maintain it, so I decided to upgrade our robo vacuum. I got this on sale and it’s quickly become my new favorite thing! Here are my favorite things about it (in no particular order):

1) It works! I thoroughly vacuumed with our Dyson upright before I started using it, so I didn’t think it would have much to pick up (although we do have 3 pets, 2 little boys, and me who makes a mess in the kitchen). I just emptied it after a couple days out of curiosity and was amazed by the amount of stuff it has been picking up! The pictures are from when I emptied it after about 4 days. It makes me feel so much better about walking around.

2) On that note, my feet feel so much better! Between the cats tracking litter around, the kids dropping crumbs, and the dog tracking dirt and grass from outside, our floors were always full of different textures that were not fun to walk on. Now I just feel the floor!

3) I love the app and the map feature! After reading reviews (and the manual), I let it charge fully before running it the first time. It mapped my house perfectly in one go and I was able to immediately label the rooms. It’s really nice because if one room is a mess, I can still run it in other rooms.

4) The self emptying feature is awesome. I love that I don’t have to remember if I emptied it already before running it.

The only real issue is that it doesn’t seem to connect to Echo devices like it claims. Apparently I’m not the only one who has this issue. For me it’s not a deal breaker, but I understand how that could be an important feature for some, particularly those with certain disabilities. But for our ADHD family, it is a very welcome addition!"
5,Does a good job,"I have had this vacuum for about a year now. We have used it in 2 different homes. It was able to map the entire house in the first go. In both houses we had a den with a step down; All you have to do to vacuum that room is removed it from the dock place it in the room and press clean. The only thing that I'd say is ""rudimentary"" is the scheduling; you can only schedule the whole house, not any particular room. However, you can directly command via the app. to clean a room or a select group of rooms. This is ok for me considering the price is relatively affordable."
5,Love love love,"Update: I have it set to run every other day during the week and Sat, Sun. It has been great and I am still very happy with this vac. The cats love hearing it start and watch to make sure it is doing its job!

Sturdy,set up was easy. Seems to have good suction. I have three cats and needed something to help stay ahead of the hair. The app is easy to use and keeps me informed."
5,Great Vacuum,"Great vacuum, great suction, does a good job in every area.. my dog sleeps under the bed.. it cleans up the hair great. It did clog up on the first few tries.. but I believe that was because the hair was so thick.. not its fault! I sleep better knowing under the bed is just as clean as the rest of the house. Thank you Shark!

Ps. I have not owned any other robot vacuums to compare.. but no need to look further."
5,Does a great job!,"I bought this Shark a couple of months ago. I have some arthritis so it was getting harder to use a vacuum cleaner. I am so glad that I did. It cleans beautifully, even gets close to the walls. I use about once a week. I do dog sit twice a week in my home and it completely picks up dog fur. One of the best purchases I have made and I am so happy not to cause pain to myself trying to use a regular vacuum."
5,Pretty easy to set up and operate.,"I did a good bit of research before deciding on the Shark. We have a Shark upright and another dustbuster size Shark so we are very positive about their products.
I chose a spot for the dock that doesn't really comply with the instructions but it hasn't affected the operation in the least. It is under a side table in a bedroom. Works very well from there.
I used the app to map my apartment, which it did very well. I closed the doors to rooms i didn't want it to go - either because i just want them cleaned more thoroughly by our cleaning service or i thought it might get stuck on the rugs. It handles rugs pretty well, though.
Minor complaint that others have mentioned: it doesn't take the same route each time. And it goes over the same areas more than once.
The first time it ran, it got itself stuck under a low riser dresser so i now put a stool in front of the dresser to prevent that.
I think the app is pretty slick and easy to use. You can set it to vacuum every day or any odd assortment of days. Ours runs twice a week to be sure the cat hair gets cleaned out.
First run complaint: since it was vacuuming under beds, it was probably going places that had not been vacuumed in a long time. So that first time, it filled the bin with cat hair and just stopped in mid run. I had to take it back to the dock but even then it couldn't off load the hair. It was too full and compacted so i had to remove the bin from the robot and clean it by hand. That hasn't happened again though. Just be aware if you have any areas like that.
The app lets you do the whole house, just one room, or a selected 5 ft square space. In the app, choosing Spot, it puts a square in the middle of the screen with the house map over laid. You choose the spot by moving the map under the square until it is over the area you want cleaned. It's not intuitive, but once you see it, you know how it works.
I read many of the older reviews that mentioned a magnetic strip to keep it from going certain places like off a step. I was wondering where those strips were because mine did not come with any. I almost returned it before the first run because i do have a sunken room and was concerned about it going off the step but it ran right up to the edge, stopped, and then ran along the entire width without a problem. Pretty impressive.
It will obviously have trouble negotiating table and chair legs so if you want those areas cleaned you will need to move the chairs.
It would also be nice to know how to deal with the sunken area of our home. For now, i take it off the dock and carry it to that room before turning it on. It does the room completely and returns to the starting point where i again have to pick it up and return it to the dock. Then, i have to use the app or the button on top to tell it to return to the dock, which works ok. Im just concerned if this confuses the mapping of the rest of the house. I wish the instructions addressed this issue."
5,Alfred is my hero!,"I LOVE my shark. His name is Alfred, and let me tell you, Alfred has become part of the family. I feel emotionally connected to him, like he’s one of my cats. I think he’s adorable.
You cannot beat the convenience of coming home to a clean house. You can schedule cleans or clean right before you get home. I’ll typically set up a schedule, but if I’m leaving for a few days, I’ll turn it off and do a clean right before I come home so my kitties don’t get freaked out. Alfred does a great job, especially with the litter dust that my cats track everywhere. He even gets the clumps of fur! I think the only place that he misses are underneath chairs and right against the counters.
I saw that many people had issues with mapping. I didn’t have a problem with this. Getting my vacuum connected to the wifi was a little frustrating, but everything else was easy to set up! He needed to map it once, and I haven’t had an issue since. The interface gets smarter every day.
My cats took a few days to get used to it. They HATE regular vacuums because they’re so loud. Alfred is pretty quiet! They didn’t like him because he would come towards them while they were eating lol (I probably shouldn’t have scheduled the clean so close to their feeding schedule!). They would run away and jump on the counters to stare in fear. Now they don’t bother with him and just stand there while Alfred bumps them.
Overall, this was the best purchase I have ever made. I tell everyone about my third cat, Alfred. This was worth every penny, and I will never buy a traditional vacuum again. The only thing I would suggest is making the app have more features like vacuum tracking (it doesn’t show you where it is). If you’re debating it, buy it!"
5,Love her!!,We have named her Hazel and she is now a part of our family. She does a really good job sweeping the floor. We live out in the country so there’s always dirt and sand that comes in on our shoes or our dogs. Hazel doesn’t mind at all. I set her to clean twice a day and we can now walk barefoot in our house again. She’s really quiet so we even let her work while we are watching tv. She first maps out the area and then cleans the center. The only thing I would change is for her sweepers to be longer to reach a little further under the furniture. This was a very good purchase.
5,clever little gadget!,"We love it! Does a great job.... push the button, and let it clean! it even recharges by itself (if need be during cleaning)... and dumping the garbage is a sinch!

We loved it so much, we purchased a 2nd one! Way to go Shark! :c)"
5,Highly Recommend!,"Absolutely love this robot vacuum! I have 3 golden retrievers and 4 cats so my house is always covered in fur. I had many Roombas for many years, but the quality has went down downhill lately, therefore the search for a new robot vacuum began. What sold me on this specific model was it did not have the mop attachment and the self empty base.

Pros: Set up was very easy and not time consuming. The home mapping is amazingly accurate, plus you can label the rooms and set boundaries. It alerts you if stuck or any obstacles are in it's way. Plus, my favorite function is you can set a schedule for when to run!

Cons: Can be noisy when it's emptying itself, but overall pretty quiet when running."
5,Very impressive machine,"I bought this for my wife. We have small kids so we have kept carpet throughout most of the living areas.

We found out our youngest is allergic to dust so my wife and I (mostly her) have been vacuuming almost daily.

I bought this for my wife for her birthday and she said it was the best gift I've ever given her. We literally just say ""hey Google, tell R2D2 to vacuum the living room"" and bam, off it goes.

It sucks up an impressive amount of dirt, dog hair, and random snacks. Overall I'm pretty impressed. Well worth the money."
5,Little sharky,"I hardly writ reviews, but my little shark needed to be reconized! This thing has become part of the family! The kids all look forward to his schedule and motivates them to get there things out of the way.
For the price, this unit will work hard! And does a fantastic job on hardwood and carpet. I thought my house was ""pretty clen"" but everyday that machine picks up so much hair and dust..I am surprised.
It finds it's way around the house and thru the chairs with surprisingly accuracy.
How long will it last? I hope forever..we would truly miss it."
5,Amazing Vacuum - Worth Every Penny!,"I don't typically take the time to write reviews, but I thought this one deserved my time. We recently adopted a dog, bringing out pet count up to 3 with two cats already at our home, along with my partner and I both having long hair. Even with a house cleaner weekly, I decided I was done sweeping/vacuuming every day and it was time to splurge on a robot vacuum. I did tons of research and asked around, read every comparison review I could find and finally landed on this vacuum. I have only had it a week and I can't even begin to explain how excited I am about it.

We ran it the day after we got it, after we had given it a full charge and a new home in the laundry room. The directions say 3 ft of space on either side and 5 ft in front, our definitely doesn't have 3 ft on either side (it does have 5 ft in front) and it seems to work just fine. The first day we ran it, it did a pretty stellar job of mapping our house. It got confused a few times but eventually figured it out (after cleaning my office 5 times, not complaining) and the map looks pretty spot on. We are working to break it out into rooms now.

We have run it TWICE so far, and the amount of dirt and hair it has picked up is absurd - good absurd in the sense that the vacuum is doing it's job, bad absurd in that ew.

I read some reviews that this machine was loud, which is a joke. Whoever thinks this vacuum is loud has clearly never used an actual vacuum before. It runs so quietly my cats don't even run away from it and as long as it's not in my office it doesn't disrupt my work calls at all.

I wanted all the features of the roomba i7 without the price and this definitely delivers. I wanted mapping as we have tons of furniture and stuff for it to navigate around and I didn't want a vacuum that would only clean my office forever, eventually it had to figure it out. I wanted one that would resume cleaning because our house can be tough to navigate and I didn't think it could cover the full floorplan in 90 minutes, and most of all I needed a stationary dust bin for it to return to and empty before it resumed cleaning as - given the amount of hair - I knew I would spend all of my time emptying out the vacuum bin if it didn't self empty. This vacuum hit all of those nails on the head and does a great job at all of them.

There are obviously some quirks to this vacuum, to assume it can be entirely self sufficient is getting a little too expectant of a robot vacuum - it doesn't have AI programmed into it. We have already had to clean out the vacuum once, as there is hair that gets wrapped around the spool and sometimes if the dust/hair clumps it has trouble sucking it up the bin station. The positives to this is the vacuum docked rather than me searching the house for it, and it immediately let me know there was a clog and I was able to very easily take the bin out, pull the hair out, and throw it away. I was expecting this and am completely okay with this, knowing we have an above average amount of hair and dirt in the house.

Overall I think this vacuum is worth the extra $200 that sets it apart from it's lesser models for all the needs it fulfills as listed above. I think the cost benefit analysis of how many times i have to drag my clunky vacuum out and run it through the house (not even able to hit the tough to reach spots the shark is able to get) versus the $500 that this vacuum cost is no contest. I will update this review after a few months to comment on the longevity of the product, but as of now I'm absolutely ecstatic about my purchase and would highly recommend this vacuum to anyone who asks."
5,Better than new version for hair,The new version has moved the comb from the removable cartridge to under making this one super easy to clear the hair vs new version where roller and cartridge and then clean the vacuum
5,Well worth the investment!,"I'm so glad I decided to take the plunge and get this Shark (baby shark) robot vacuum. We have 5 dogs which 3 shed massive amounts of hair. I've got her (my robot) set up to do the livingroom and connecting dining room. I was concerned the dogs would be freaked out or think it was another toy. Happily enough they sit in the couch and just watch. The only real noise it makes is when returning to the dock to empty. I only have to dust mop along and behind the furniture. It does a great job transitioning between the hardwood floor and area rugs. It goes everywhere it can reach. The suction is very good and I don't have to go over the floors again with a manual vacuum. Easy easy! I LOVE this robot vacuum. I'll add the kitchen, hall and bath later. I just can't say enough good things about this Shark robot vacuum."
5,"Was sceptical, but now LOVE not vacuuming 1-2 a day!","The purpose of purchasing this was not to expect a spotless house, it was for me to not need to vacuum two times a day bcos I own 2x 100+ lb giant dogs 🤪

My specs in looking for a robovac: Pet hair was a must item it can tackle, and hardwood floors with rugs, also an affordable price point…

After 4days, I will say GAME CHANGER. I love I can run it in different areas and rooms, and make certain rooms/spaces “ultra cleaned” — one of my other favourite things is that it goes under my bed and reaches, dust and pet hair I can’t reach with my Dyson stick vac and swiffer (picture attached of hair from first run in our bedroom).

Things to consider and note:
• You need to pick up anything you have like cords, toys, shoes etc. before running it to maximise its clean - my dogs love pulling toys out and normally have 5-10 across the lounge/entry way.
• it is kind of louder than I expected, but so is the normal vacuum, and vacuums have noise regardless and tbh, I’ll take it if I’m not the one doing the cleaning…
• I chose this model and brand due to the hair roller thing that spins, because of my long hair dogs and own hair — i like you can remove the roller and clean if needed (robovac got in a pile of pillow stuffing my dog ripped up) and it’s easy to unclog or unwrap hair.
• Battery life is actually really good
• It maneuvers really well on rugs, around objects. Couldn’t deal with something bonking into every item to get where it needs to go. It also climbs up on higher pile mats and my tiled fire place.
• it’s sensor does well to return to dock and avoid things like the dogs or items like bags that may be in the way.
• self empty bin, it does not require bags and holds a decent amount - I choose to empty daily due to dog hair - also, it has a filter too so similar to the dyson self empty.
• you do need a space in your house with nothing 3ft either side of the unit or 5ft in front of its base/home — I have an older and more intimately spaced duplex so this was kinda a struggle where the outlets are located but I made it work.
• the app, I wish you could see where it is at in its clean (tells you an eta for time to clean rooms or house) but cannot say what % it’s at of the clean — maybe they’ll make this upgrade this in the future.

This is my first week and I’ll update this review if it doesn’t live up to my expectations. But overall, for the price point (scored during Black Friday at $299 pre tax) and it’s easy usage, functional settings and smart (enough) capabilities I’m happy. I also dig that it is white/silver, not a massive fan of having a black unit in my walk way. It’s cute and works great! Definitely recommend.

Also, I read reviews and blogs to research best options… please consider your own personal expectation of these appliances. If you’re looking for a deep cleaner, hire a cleaner. If you don’t want to vacuum all the time like me, I hate the feeling of sand and dirt under my feet — this is the gadget for you!"
5,Great Robot Vacuum!,"This robot vacuum has been a life saver for me. We have dogs and the only way to keep the house clean is to vacuum every day. However, my life does not allow that nor do I want to be chained to a daily chore. So, after much research I decided to give the Shark a try since I loved my Navigator. The reviews mentioned it was good on pet hair, it has a self emptying option, used Matrix clean and it worked off Wi-Fi and not Alexa....all facts that appealed to me. Now, I am kicking myself for waiting so long to purchase an item to make my life easier.
My house is 124 years old and has lots of raised thresholds so this was my first concern. I have all heart pine floors with many area rugs so I wanted to make sure the transition was smooth between the two. This vacuum has exceeded my expectations. My floors remain clean and debris free and we are loving life! I have the app on my phone and choose which rooms I want vacuumed. It worked great while I had company at my house for week. I could kept the floor clean while and set it off early in the morning or when we went to bed and left me plenty of time for entertaining.
Now, If you think a robot vacuum will 100% replace a regular vacuum, I do not see that happening. I pull out one of my manual one to use at times (especially when I intend to mop) but what I empty is far less than I used to. Still, I highly recommend having this product in you life."
5,Best purchase in quite awhile.,"We recently added a black lab to our family. We also have a 3 year old long-haired cat. I could not keep up with the pet hair. Enter this Shark vacuum and my stress has melted away. We have named him Bruce. He makes my heart happy when he goes to work at 8:30 am daily, tirelessly working away to give us clean floors."
5,STILL WORKING SO WELL,Four years later and the Shark never disappoints. Each time it cleans it is as is I mopped floor. Works so well picking up on our hardwood floors!!!
5,It’s great!,I love this little robot vacuum! I am able to vacuum by room or my whole house. Hair does become tangled in the roller and needs cleaned out often but overall this has made my life a lot easier especially as a mom who is always on the go!
5,Game changer!!,"If you’re on the fence, don’t stay there. Get the vacuum. I would pay almost any amount of money to get the relief this thing has given us from the pet hair. We have four dogs, two of them shed. And when I say shed, I’m talking two Saint Bernards who dump BUCKETS of hair all over our clothes, carpet, shoes, basically every item in our entire house. I DID NOT KNOW DOGS COULD EVEN SHED THIS MUCH. We were going crazy, and constantly frustrated vacuuming the floors, couches, lint rolling everything. I honestly didn’t even know if I could handle keeping the dogs, the hair was so bad! I bought this vacuum a month ago and already, our lives are changed. I run it multiple times a day, with just one push of a button. It picks up so much hair! Before I would find wads of hair in every corner, just minutes after I already vacuumed! Now, I know there’s some hair in the house but I don’t really see it or notice it much. My floors seem to stay mainly hair free. I walk into a room and see vacuum lines and a clean floor. It’s so amazing I almost cry every time. It gets under all my barstools and couches, and in places I didn’t even think it would go. It’s agile! Oh, Did I mention we also have four little kids?! Ya, there’s a lot of crap all over our floor, and this thing picks up all of it. I love running it at night and waking up to a cleaner house than when I went to bed! The fact that it empties itself and keeps cleaning is the single greatest thing about it. Seriously, if I weren’t married I may consider wedding myself to this dang vacuum, it’s that good!! Buy it!!"
5,Love this vacuum,I researched several robotic vacuumes before purchasing and ultimately decided on the shark and love it. Easy to set up and use the app and great cleaning capabilities. My boyfriend has cat allergies and started using this when moved in together and he has had no allergy issues!
5,"Very satisfied, Great value, great price, great product!","We’ve had our shark for just about 48 hours now and could not be happier. It is still painting the map of our house, but it is getting really close.

I have run it 6-7 times so far, and only once had to interrupt it due to getting in a precarious area of our den, but the map is getting more and more accurate. I have learned through other comments and reviews that it is best to turn OFF recharge and evacuate and resume modes while the bot is painting the map. This has helped a lot. I let it run about 45-60 minutes before having it head back to base, and have found this to be the best way to get a complete map. Once the map is completed, I will turn those modes back on.

We have 3 dogs, two of which shed a lot of hair, and were our primary reason for the purchase. I am very satisfied with the amount of hair that is collected. There was a little that was stuck within brushes, but I feel that is mostly due to to some areas we have neglected before that has some build up. That only happened initially, and has not been ongoing.

We were concerned with some other reviews about the noise level, but I have run in all three modes, and find the noise to be acceptable. Like many of us these days, I work from home and host many conference calls and have not found there to be any issue. Of course if the bot is running around your feet in max mode, you will have issues, but not in normal or eco modes. If this was a typical corded or cordless vacuum I doubt you could say the same.

Talking of comparison between a regular push-pull vacuum and the bot, you are not going to get the same suction, although I don’t know that any manufacturer is yet close to make that claim. However, I feel like the shark does it’s job and does it very well. It is picking up the hair, dust and dirt we hoped and expected it to. I am ready to purchase a mop equivalent to follow our bots footsteps. I know the Roomba has it already, but I have not searched for the Shark version yet.

Talking of Shark vs Roomba: We did extensive research online and found the comparison reviews to be very comparable in performance, quality and ease of use. Our main deal breaker was price, and that, above all made our decision. However, with that said, we have also been loyal to Shark over the many years as we have always been happy with their quality. But will also admit that we have yet to purchase a Roomba to compare it to. But feature for feature, we found the Shark to be half to price of the Roomba, and that speaks for itself.

Again, overall, we are very, very satisfied with this product upon initial use. Our only fault was not following provided instruction initially, but have learned from others user experience. We have a two story house, and now we know it works on one floor, we are ready to purchase another for the top floor. The ease of use and the time we save, and the areas the bot gets to above what we would get to with a push-pull vacuum, we feel like it is a great investment... With that said, I only hope I am not having to update this review in the next few weeks/months with any issues, but definitely, so far, so good!"
5,Daily vacuuming was never easier!,"I’ve had Rosie about 6 months and is programmed to run through the entire house every morning. Getting under beds was a major concern for me. My house is very dusty from being close to 3 major highways and a mile from a major international airport. The daily vacuum prevents dust buildup and helps to keep my house cleaner and with a lot less dusting needed throughout the house. I am disabled and appreciate having a resource that will do these tasks. I use the daily scheduling but don’t talk to the vacuum. It empties regularly on its own so that is a bonus. The main compartment will hold a lot of dust. It won’t last 2 months with my excessive dust but it is easy to empty the bin. Connectivity has been lost a few times but it doesn’t seem to be a regular problem and has not stopped Rosie from doing her job. The app for Rosie is easy to use and helps to keep track of your vacuuming results. It takes about 90 minutes to vacuum my small 3 bedroom house. Halfway through her task she returns to base to empty. She is usually about 15% battery when she returns to recharge. After she recharges there is usually about 6 more minutes of vacuuming to finish up and she does that once she is fully charged about 2 1/2 hours later.
The vacuum goes under tables and chairs and beds easily, but not under my couch and chairs and ottoman or dressers that have a lower profile.
I don’t have problems so far. I’ve had to replace a brush after it got caught on a rug, which was simple, and I’ve had to clear the brush roller a couple times. All was easy to accomplish. I’ve used the matrix clean room cleaner and the no-go zone feature. Both worked well. (You need the app for these functions)
If you accidentally kick your vacuum or it gets knocked off the base, it will return on its on. You can easily use your vacuum without the app, there are controls for cleaning and docking on the top of the vacuum. The app helps you program daily vacuum or a certain time. That is convenient for me. The only thing that could be a problem is where you locate the vacuum. There should be 5 feet of clearance on both sides and the front for the vacuum to have space to realign with the base.
When I bought this it was not reviewed yet, and in spite of my hesitation, I do not regret my purchase. I paid just under $400 for my vacuum and I highly recommend this product."
5,GAME CHANGING PRODUCT!,"Have you ever purchased something just for ‘you’, selfishly, knowing you probably don’t ‘need’ it, but really WANT it?

After working weeks of 12 hour days, 6 days a week, I decided I was sick of vacuuming; especially all the kitty litter dust my two fur babies left all over the carpet. I have two long-haired cats who I adore, but they shed and leave trails of kitty-litter all over my apartment. I hated stepping on it.

After living in this apartment for 5 years with two cats and a crappy vacuum, and my lazy self, I bought the Shark robot vacuum, hoping it could bring the carpets back from grossville.

One time, I brought home the Rug Doctor and hurt my back trying to rejuvenate these old carpets, and all I got in the end was an empty wallet and sciatica. Well, maybe I felt a little less germy for a bit.

This is going to sound like a late-night TV infomercial, but I cannot believe the difference the Shark robot vacuum has made on these old carpets in just two weeks! Literally, night and day difference. I now wonder if I’m actually allergic to my cats because I’m no longer sniffling, having runny eyes and sneezing like I used to.

The Shark has pulled so much cat hair and kitty litter dust from these carpets that it’s disgusting to think what I was living with before.

Now that I own a Shark robo-vacuum, I realize it wasn’t an item I just wanted, so I didn’t have to vacuum, or a new toy to amuse me and the cats, but a powerful tool I actually NEEDED in keeping my home clean and allergy-free.

Get one. I promise you will love it."
5,Game Changer,"We bought this & set it up only a few days ago but so far it’s been a game changer. We had a VERY old Roomba several years ago that was handed down to us and it was okay, but nothing we replaced when the battery finally died. It was probably one of the first generations, but it swept haphazardly and filled easily so would stop until we emptied it. This Shark is obviously much newer with better technology, and we love it! I cant imagine not having one in the future. We have 3 kids, a big dog, an asphalt driveway, and live in the woods so the dust, grit, and dirt is constant. We’ve programmed this to run every other day and our floors are so much cleaner! We LOVE it.

We did not have any trouble with mapping like some others did. We read a few reviews on here and turned on every light in the house and picked up toys before it mapped and that worked perfectly. We only had to do it 1 time. The app is helpful to see and set your rooms after mapping. We also have it synced to our Google Home app. I’m amazed at how persistent our little shark is at getting under cabinets and around end tables. We love the matrix feature for our floors. It was pretty impressive to watch it ultimately make the grid pattern. My best advice is just to let it go - don’t move it or reposition it while it’s sweeping. Trust the process and it’ll get smarter each time. You’ll end up with perfect straight lines. Pretty impressive.

The battery has good charge for our home. We have it sweeping about 1,600 square feet of our main floor and no need for it to recharge in the middle. It emptied about 2 times, but it goes right back to where it was sweeping afterward like a good little worker. It goes from carpet, to rug, to wood floor seamlessly. It’s quiet and not disruptive. The empty sounds like a bit of a jet, but it’s brief. You do need to have a 3 ft area around the front of your base so it can back itself in and turn around, but it’s not an eye sore. And honestly, this thing is so helpful that I don’t even care. My husband and I watch in amazement. We said it’s like getting a color TV for the first time - we want to have all our friends and family over to watch and share the excitement!"
5,LOVE,"Massive upgrade from the previous generation shark robots. The smart AI actually functions as you would expect this go round and the suction seems 10x better (old shark would pick up debris but leave dust behind).
The mapping and session options have been massively upgraded and I love that you can set ""no go"" zones through the app.
Set up and control is incredibly simple and the build seems more durable than the last."
5,Works Great,"It appears that a lot of the complaints people had about this may have been fixed with an update, because I am not having any issues.

Mapping: A+
It mapped my entire house in one run and it created a very accurate map of my home.

Cleaning: A+
Does an amazing job on hardwood for pet hair. Also cleans our low Pyle carpet really well - sucked a ton of dust out of the carpet. Cleans way better than the previous vacuum we had.

App: B-
- The app is very simple to use and allows you to spot clean, whole house clean, etc. You can create separate rooms in the app and then clean rooms one at a time if desired.
- You can create No-Go areas - I did this for the one place in our dining room where our dog sometimes has accidents. I wish you could make smaller no go zones, because right now I have to use half my dining room for my poop free no go zone, instead of just the corner of the room for a no go zone.
- The app does not show progress during a clean. Other brands have apps that track the movement of the vacuum and draw lines on the map as it cleans. This would be a great update, as the current functionality is sub par.
- You cannot remote control the vacuum from the app. Roborock vacuums can be remote controlled with the app - a really nice feature if you want to clean a very small spot.

Dust Bin: A
- The vacuum empty’s automatically into the dustbin. Only problem here is that the process is very loud and might wake light sleepers if scheduling night runs.

Navigation / Getting stuck: A+
- So far my vacuum has not gotten stuck, but I did have to move some cords off the floor for fear it woul.

Overall for $299, this is a great vacuum. The app is a bit behind other competitors’ apps, but it works fine and gets the job done for now. The excellent cleaning and dust bin make up for anything the app is lacking. I do wish it could avoid dog poops, but there’s only one vacuum on the market that does that and it costs $999."
5,Works great!,Works as described absolutely love the self emptying feature. Works great with the app.
5,Even Goes Under the Beds!,"We love this little vacuum! She did a great job when she mapped out our house. The first time she cleaned, it took a little longer for her to acquaint herself with the layout. I am able to set her cleaning schedule via the SharkClean app. She cleans every other day. I added a couple of ""No-Go Zones"" to help her avoid areas that might be difficult for her to access. She does a great job (I've been shocked at how much dust/dirt/pet hair is in the bin when I need to empty it!) And she even cleans under our beds! 'Nuff said!"
5,Great product,The area I had cleaned was the center of my house. It did a great job. If you look at the picture next to the room layout You can see what it picked up. The are cleaned was 1149 ft. 121 min. Works better than my swifter pads I will not use as many. I threw something on top of it without thinking. It is a Keeper.
5,Best appliance ever,"If I had to evacuate… this would come with me. Makes my rug look brand new every time I use it. Wonderful suction and it empties into a separate canister I can see what it picks up. I have a white cat so it gets to the hair before my clothes. Gets to aces I don’t even get to! Love, love, love"
5,Awesome Robot Vacuum!!!,"I HIGHLY recommend this robot vacuum!

To give you some context of the surface and space we are using this robot vacuum for, our house is laminate wood, we have 2 children and 2 dogs that shed. I run our robot vacuum at least once a day. I do make sure that all toys, clothes, and other items that could get sucked up and cause trouble are picked up before I run it.

For years we had a Debot robot vacumm. It was good and did the job but I frequently had free it from getting stuck under the edges of furniture, sucking up things that would cause an error, and I had to clean it often.

After it finally died, we bought the Shark. It was on some kind of really good sale and we got it for a little over $300. I was nervous because that was a lot more than our previous robot vacuum but it promised to do much more.

After having the Shark for a couple months and running it every day, I can tell you that it is WELL worth the money.

FEATURES I LIKE:
1. Run time:
love that this thing will clean for a solid 2 hours. The running time is far superior than the vacuum we had previously.

2. Doesn’t get stuck:
I have not had to rescue this robot a single time. It can get under our furniture just fine and it never gets caught under edges of things. It also can get over obstacles in a room. For example, if I forgot a dog or kid toy out, it can climb over things with no problem.

Brush Protection:
This vacuum does not allow for as many things to get sucked up and cause an error code. It has some protection over the brush to keep this from happening. I have had to get one child sock out but that was my fault. On my previous vacuum, I was having to get things out that were stuck ALL the time.

4. Self Emptying Feature:
The self emptying feature is awesome. The Shark will clean and empty itself if it gets full and then get right back to work. The vacuum on the home base seems very strong and does a good job of extracting the contents from the Shark itself. The Shark never has a problem with finding its home base. I used to have to empty our previous robot daily. Now I empty the main container from the home base every week or so.

5. It stays clean:
Our previous robot vacuum would accumulate dirt and hair in the crevices of the robot. On the Shark, I have not noticed this to be a problem. I was ALWAYS have to cut hair and remove dirt from little spots on the Debot.

All in all, I LOVE this robot vacuum. I would definitely not bat an eye at paying more than $300 for this thing. I cannot speak to the rest of time but it wouldn’t surprise me if this lasts a long time."
5,Good value for the money,"I have about 2,550 sq. ft. in a single level home. mostly tile with carpet in bedrooms. Through out the living area we have three different tables with chairs, couches, bar stools and other normal furniture. This is a challenging home for any robot vacuum. I have used the ""I Robot Rumba 700 series"" for about five years before purchasing this Shark IQ vacuum robot.
The Shark set-up was pretty easy and after charging I began operations. I knew that it would take many runs to map my floor plan and it certainly has. After about sixteen hours run time, it shows only 22% mapped. Part of this I caused by picking the unit up and moving it to another room. I probably confused the heck out of it. I have had two conversations with tech support about the firmware version and dropping WIFI connection. The tech support was very helpful and with my MAC address, they updated the firmware. When you get your robot, you should check the version of firmware and have them update if necessary. Mine cave with version 1. The current is (V3.4.11-20191015). The WIFI issue was addressed by simply deleting the robot from the app. and reinstalling it. The Tech advisor told me that the map is stored in the cloud and I would not loose it, but I'm not sure that that has not increased the mapping time.
The robot is well built, operates well and is not any louder than my other robot, not bad. Although the base does a good job of evacuating the robot dirt container, there is still a need to clean the screens that are in the robot dust container occasionally as they do get lint covering them. I don't know the impact of the this but it seems to me that keeping it clean helps the suction of the vacuum. The Shark is good about navigating itself back to base when the battery is low. It is my opinion that the battery should have longer duration capacity. In my house, the robot can not complete cleaning the house before needing a recharge. It takes about four hours to recharge before resuming where it left off for cleaning. We like to run it while we are away from the house so this creates an annoyance for us. I have not yet determined how well it finds the location to continue the cleaning. The robot has done a very good job at finding it's way back to base and rarely does it get stuck between chairs or under cabinets etc. I do like this the Shark very much and I do recommend it to friends. My assumption is that the unit will only improve with software updates as it seems to be built well and does a good job cleaning.
UPDATE: I have been operating this robot for about 3 months now. There has been a recent improvement to the mapping capabilities and I could not be more pleased. I knew that it had some deficiencies mapping when I purchased it. I was anticipating improvement and I am very pleased to report that Shatk came through. My robot is performing almost without flaw. It cleans very well, cleans selected rooms, rarely gets stuck and always returns to base. Good job Shark!!
Update: I have now been operating this robot for about eight months. It is operating flawlessly. The mapping has been great, defining the rooms works very well, I am so impressed that hair does not wind-up on the brush. I generally send it out to do a couple of rooms each day. I do not make any adjustments in furniture, chairs etc. I feel that the robot should work without forcing me to make any adjustments and it has worked very well. It finds it way back to base every time and just doesn't seem to ever get stuck. This has is a great asset and would not want to be without it. I have not been using it at night. I don't know if it would be able to navigate without light, I should try it."
5,Best robot vaccuum yet!,I love my Shark robot vaccuum!!! Saves me so much time! We have a German shepherd and a husky and there's always dog hair on the floor. I run this everyday to keep the floors clean and only pull out the real vaccuum (also a shark and also love it) maybe once a week now just to get the stuff if hard to reach places. I can run this and then immediately mop that's how good it works. Love the self emptying feature. Although that part is pretty loud. Otherwise pretty quiet (compared to a previous Roomba and off brand I had before) . Mapping worked great first time! I love the app and ease to be able to tell it from anywhere what floors I need cleaned. This little thing is persistent too. It goes over my bathroom scale lol. Very Happy I purchased!!
5,Oh my gosh!,"So much better than my iRobot last vacuum, plus the pricing is so much better. Very happy after switching to this new brand for me. Luv my new robo vac"
5,The best vacuum robot I ever tried - reliable and cleans like no other,"I was trying several vacuum robots from companies specialised in these robots. What should I say: they all were a disaster. My biggest disappointment was with the iRobot Roomba S9 - what a piece of overpriced wannabe vacuum robot. When the shark robot was on offer at Amazon, I ordered it and was very certain that I would return it again. Shark doing robots? Nope… I was sooooo wrong! Setting the vacuum robot up was super easy and intuitive. When I started the mapping run I thought it would take hours, but in less than 30 minutes my floor was completely mapped and as accurate as it could be (the roomba s9 was taking hours for the first mapping run and even after a 2 weeks cleaning period the maps were still very off). I have the Shark now over 1 months and this is not only a perfect robot but a superb vacuum cleaner. Compared to the roomba s9 this thing sucks all the dirt out.

I was one week on vacation and set the robot up to do daily cleaning runs (to get rid of the hairs of my cats). This never went well with my “old” roombas (“your roomba is stuck”). Not with this shark. Cleaned every day and never got stuck. Is there anything better than returning from vacation and find your home clean?

I can only highly recommend this robot. Definitly beats all the other once I tried and the price is amazing!"
5,Best Amazon Purchase EVER!,"This thing is worth every single penny! My floors are luxury vinyl planking throughout my house, so I can’t attest as to how it would do on carpet, but on hard floors it does exactly what it’s supposed to do. But there’s so much more to it than that! Ugh, where do I even start? Okay, first of all, my household consists of my two teenage daughters and I. Females typically shed a lot—we are no exception. On top of that, we have an indoor dog who, though short-haired, also sheds like crazy. I’ve had this vacuum for three months now, and it sucks up hair, dirt, glitter, whatever just like a vacuum should. Second, I’ve only had to remove the brush three times to remove something that had bound it, and even then, it was wound up on the very end of the roller and just pulled off of the end like a little cap…no cutting and unwinding like with all the other vacuum rollers I’ve ever wrestled. Okay, next, my girls will tell you—you gotta be tough to survive in my house. No hothouse flowers here, and if you need special attention, you better plan on giving it to yourself—I ain’t got time for that. So, no, I don’t prewash dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, and I ain’t gonna go around picking everything up off the floor before I run the robot vacuum, either. This thing is great at going over cords, rugs, etc…heck it even kicked it in 4WD and climbed over a bunch of shoes my daughter had left in the floor to take to the thrift store, and it regularly climbs on top of the bathroom scale and vacuums it. So, yeah, it has no problem tackling rugs and that sort of thing. It also navigates obstacles like kitchen table and chair legs with no problem, as well—anywhere it’s found its way into, it’s found its way out of. And speaking of finding its way, when it’s time for it to go to its charger, it goes straight there and hasn’t failed to successfully dock itself a single time. And that brings me to my final point: even in a house with four shedding mammals, a house where nobody is doing any extra floor cleaning to help it out, a house that is very much lived in—there’s tons of cooking, planting, crafting, etc going on up in here—when this thing said 60-day capacity on the waste receptacle, it meant it. We didn’t have to empty it for the first time until we had had it more like 70 days. This thing over delivers on every promise it made!"
5,WOW! THIS THING IS A GAME CHANGER!,"Love love love! Upgraded my plain jane shark to this one. We've had it a few years and we've gotten our money's worth. We decided that we needed a new one and this new one has not disappointed yet! We have a dog and 3 kids, but you can't tell at all with our CLEAN floors! 10/10!!!"
5,Absolutely amazing; I haven't manually vaccumed in weeks and my house is very clean,"This thing far exceeded my expectations. We have a dog and that means hair everywhere. I programmed this thing to automatically vacuum every day and it does a great job. It's not very loud and does an amazing job. We had 3 dogs for a week and it even kept up with that. Of course, if you leave socks and bras on the floor it will suck them up and get stuck but you shouldn't do that anyway (I'm talking to you, honey!). It navigates around chairs, goes under the bed, etc. Of course it can't get into the very corner of a room but it gets very close.

The only bad thing is that it can only map out a single floor. My house is one level with a sunken great room; to get it to clean other floors you just carry it to there and press the clean button. Not terrible, but it seems like an obvious feature that is missing. You also can't program it to clean more than once a day. Still, have I mentioned that my house is ALWAYS CLEAN? It's awesome--like having a maid but you only have to pay once. I rarely recommend products to friends, this one is an exception."
5,"Somewhat skeptical at first, but overly impressed! Immediately ordered a second.","After researching and reading a bunch of reviews across multiple brands and price points of robot vacuums, I ultimately decided on this vacuum due to the features and price point. I wasn't looking to spend over $800 like most robot vacuums with a self-emptying base. I was able to get this on Prime Day for a great deal, so I decided to pull the trigger and purchase it. I don't typically take the time to write reviews, but this vacuum is so good that I had to.

At the time of writing this review, I've had it for about a week. Before ordering this, I already had a super cheap robot vacuum that did not have a self-emptying base and wandered around aimlessly while cleaning. It didn't have a roller brush and was worthless on the carpet. I have a dog that sheds, and it's super hard to keep up on vacuuming with a busy day-to-day life. Needless to say, once I ordered this, I was very antsy to put it to use.

The setup was super easy, and I was impressed with how quickly and well it mapped my house after I had charged it up. I set up rooms and zones on the app once it had mapped my house and then started to put it to use. This robot vacuum immediately blew my mind!! The LiDAR and other features are no joke with how well they work. It did great at picking up hair and other debris on the carpet, which was one of my top concerns prior to purchasing it. It covers every inch of the floor and is so efficient with its ability to go back and forth in straight lines. It cleans exceptionally on hardwood as well. The self-emptying base is priceless. Not having to empty the vacuum itself before every cleaning makes it so convenient. If you have pets, this vacuum is a must. Yes, you'll have to vacuum your carpet with a normal vacuum occasionally, but this robot will minimize that and keep your floor looking clean every day. It's such a time saver, and I look forward to getting home to clean floors daily.

This vacuum is so good that after using this for about a day, I ordered another one for my downstairs. There may be better robot vacuums out there, but the price you pay for what you get with this vacuum is extremely hard to beat. I can't recommend this vacuum enough."
5,It’s Love,"I ordered mine on Prime Day for what I feel was a great deal. I’d been looking at robot vacuums for a while and was leaning towards a Shark or a Roomba. I am sooo happy with my Shark. It does a great job cleaning. It is pretty quick and efficient as well. Set up was easy. My concerns when ordering were some reviews said it was loud and some that that the suction wasn’t great. It is absolutely not loud. I can have it running while watching tv or while my kids are doing schoolwork, and you barely notice it. Especially on carpet. We personally have very little and are about to remove it, but you can’t even tell it is still running when it goes in a carpet room. My kitchen has ceramic tile (also coming up soon just because I don’t like the color). That is where it is the loudest. It is just the sound of it rolling over the ceramic that makes the noise. I’m going to guess that would be he case with any vacuum. And the suction has also been great. I notice no difference between its cleaning and cleaning with my Dyson. I’ve been really impressed with it. Another personal concern was hair. Not pet hair, but our hair. My regular vacuum (Dyson) gets hair wrapped all around it. And apparently we shed a lot, because I could have just vacuumed and cut hair off the roller, and it still gets wrapped in it when I vacuum again. I have not had any hair get wrapped on the Shark rollers. It has gotten some strips of my daughter’s yarn and thread that has gotten under the bed where I couldn’t see it. The robot alerted me, and I removed it. It also sucked up a couple of small toys during the first couple runs. It stopped, alerted me, and I removed them. Which brings me to my next pro. It goes right under my couches and beds. Those are places I don’t normally get everytime I vacuum, so that is a big plus for me! It doesn’t take up much room which is also great. The bin is easy to empty. The only feature I’m still working on is mapping because I deleted the map it initially created. The first couple of runs I sent it back to the dock before it went over the whole house. And it ended up creating a map that wasn’t showing my bedroom. But it is getting every room when it cleans. It gets every nook and cranny it will fit in. But I want to get my map created, so I can label my rooms. So, all this to say I am currently very happy with my purchase. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a robot vacuum. I probably wouldn’t have splurged on the self emptying bin if it hadn’t been for the Prime Day deal, but it is really nice to have. I have it set to come back and empty and resume cleaning if needed. I also have it set to return to the dock, charge, and resume if it doesn’t finish. That feature does work. It goes right back where it stopped. It also finds its way back to the dock very easily."
5,Exceeded all expectations! Highly Recommended!,"My wife and I had talked about buying a robot vac for a while, but when she fell in the garden and broke her arm, I was pretty overwhelmed with caring for her, working my job and handling cooking and housecleaning all at once.

So, I decided that this was one way that we might have one less chore to be concerned about. We live in a single story log cabin with wood and vinyl flooring and a couple of area rugs. So, I think we're probably the ideal target for a robot vac. I did some research online and decided on the Shark IQ for several reasons: 1) It was self-emptying. When it fills up, it returns to the dock and empties itself.; 2) The dock was easy and not messy to empty (at least according to the reviews I read); and , 3) It has a mapping feature and ability to schedule as needed. So, we went ahead and ordered one.

When it arrived, it was easy to set up and the first time it did the job, I was a little concerned with the erratic path it took. It seemed to jump from one area to another but eventually went back and covered the area that it missed. I noticed that the map it created didn't seem complete, but the instructions said to allow time and as it did its job multiple times, the map would improve. So, I let it go for the first week and just scheduling it every other day. Well, sure enough, after a few days of use, the map did improve and I used the app on my Android phone to identify the areas (all you can do is draw boxes ... so, I basically divided it into four sections: Living Room, Kitchen (including our open Dining Room/Kitchen/Mud Room, Master Bedroom and Office.

The map allows you to specify cleaning any room when needed and it works great because I don't want my office cleaned when I'm working and on conference calls, etc.

I guess the Shark IQ (we named it Sharky), passed the test when my wife was satisfied and remarked that, when she's looking at the sun coming in across the hardwood floors, she doesn't see any dog hair (a major issue we have with Rocket, our Jack Russell Terrier.

The Shark IQ has 3 settings (Economy, Normal and Ultraclean). It was set by default on Normal and that has been fine for our needs. It maneuvers around just fine and hasn't gotten stuck anywhere and is smart enough to return to the dock to recharge when it senses it is getting low on battery. Once recharged, it will then pick up where it left off.

To say we are satisfied would be an understatement. We're kicking ourselves for not buying one sooner. Highly recommend the Shark IQ!"
5,Worth Every Dollar,"The Shark Al Ultra Voice Control Robot Vacuum with Matrix Clean Navigation. What a mouthful! Look folks, this vaccum will be worth the price you pay. Might I venture to say even the $600.00 price tag at full price. Personally, I picked this up for $350.00 on sale and it has been more than worth it.

This vaccum sports state of the art 360° LiDAR vision. This makes the vaccum easily navigate your home with almost zero hassle. With this vaccum, you will be able to fully map your house where the vaccum has access to. Connect the vaccum to the SharkClean app on Android or IOS, and activate the ""Explore"" mode. This mode will retrieve an almost completely accurate reading of the floor your vaccum is on, enabling you to later have the capability to select 1 room at a time!

This vaccum also offers a ""Matrix"" mode. This option provides grid-like coverage to the area being cleaned! I tested this lastnight and it worked beautifully.

There seems to be no lack of suction when it comes to this vaccum! So far, it had exceeded expectations. I went to clean the dust bin on my vaccum station and the Shark itself this morning, when I noticed the vaccum's dust bin had a grape tomato in it. That to me, shows this vaccum is more than capable of competing with other products.

The only thing I wish this vaccum features was an on the go mapping update. While cleaning, this vaccum will not update the saved map to the device's profile. With this being said, if the map needs to be updated, you must delete the current version, and re-explore your house. However, the time to map a roughly 800sqft apartment is approximately 30 minutes. It is very reasonable.

If you are on the fence about purchasing this product, make the jump! It will be worth every penny!

[This is not a paid promotion/review of this product. This is a personal review of my purchase on this product.]"
5,Great for dog hair!,I have fluffy golden retriever so this has been a life saver! It can’t get hair that’s trapped in the corner of a room but that’s to be expected. It is pretty loud when emptying itself out but I can’t complain because it saves me from vacuuming everyday!
5,I love this robot vaccuum,"This robot vaccuum is a workhorse. It has made a significant impact on my household. I have two cats and we run it a couple times a week. We still vacuum once a week with a Dyson (instead of every couple days like we used to), but the robot vaccuum is great for maintenance and improving air quality due to lessened dander build up."
5,Best purchase,I have wanted one of these for years. They were kind of expensive so I was never able to get one. When I was able to buy this one it was because it was on sale for 55% off. I love it. I want multiple. I recommended one to a friend and she ended up buying it too and loves hers.
5,Very pleased.,"We already had a robo-type vacuum that randomly bumps around the house. Our dog is a Lab and a hair manufacturer, so the vacuum would be filled with hair daily. We decided to upgrade to this Shark vacuum, and we are really pleased we did. To initialize the Shark, it will roam the house, creating a map. I am not too impressed with the quality of the map (viewed on the Shark app), but it seems to work for the vacuum. One feature I appreciate is that when it determines it is full, it will stop where it is, return to the docking station, empty itself, and then return to the exact spot where it stopped to continue cleaning. I really like that it vacuums the entire area, leaving nothing behind, rather than randomly traveling around the house. There is room to improve the scheduling feature; currently, if you use the schedule, the only option is to vacuum the entire house. It would be better if you could schedule particular rooms. Regardless, the Shark is doing a great job and gets five stars from me."
5,Awesome little worker bee for a two-dog household (German Shepard and Aussie cattle dog)!!,We have two dogs - both shedders. I have run this Shark AI ULTRA Robot daily (full main floor of our home 1100SQ FT+) every day since we got it. The mapping was very good and this unit cleans and finds lots of fur every day on both plush carpet and hardwood floors. I am now very familiar with EVERY place to empty/clean on a daily basis. In addition to the dogs we were sanding our wooden deck and even with windows closed there was a LOT of redwood dust picked up in the house for the 5 days this went on (ie rinsing/drying the foam filter daily as well). The only down side of this is that it needs to recharge after doing about 75% of the floor - and that takes 3+ hours before it returns to finish up. We love the ability to schedule the whole house cycle once a day (still working out staring at midnight or various morning times) and the SPOT cleaning feature is great for where the dogs like to hang out on the front entry carpet. This is not a 100% replacement for vacuuming once a week with our Shark upright (max suction there) but keeps all the hair dust bunnies well under control on a daily basis!!! Best purchase in a long time! (Now if Shark could just create a model that could go up/down the carpeted stairs I'd be buying that ASAP!! :) )
5,Good product,Cleans floors good
5,Needed in every home!,"I was not paid to review this! I review ad nauseam if I spend more than 50.00. I have an old Roomba at home. love it but it gets stuck EVERYWHERE. We have a vacation home that is often rented and even though it was recently cleaned, a guest commented on the dust on the floor so I decided to get this when it went on sale. love the new wifi connection and the dumping over my old Roomba. couldn't wait to get it set up (still working on the no zone parts of the house ) and it doesn't seem to trip over rugs nor do I need the wall sensors to keep it out of spaces. first few times it was used, I was happy that there was little dust or pet hair to be picked up. After 5 days or using it. I decided to check out the trash bin that it dumps into and says it holds 60 days worth of debris. OMG! it looked like there were 6-78 dead squirrels in it. I could not believe the amount of matted pet hair, dust and more gross stuff that this thing picked up. I thought my house was clean and was horrified to find there were at least 4 toupees worth of stuff on the floors. This is a keeper, folks, It's easy to use and it really works especially if you have pets. .and mine are non shedding..."
5,Shark-My go to brand from now on,"This bot cleaner outperforms any Roomba model that I have ever owned..and I have had many. I have 2 ladies with long hair. After using this Shark for a week straight ONLY ON CARPET I gave it a full inspection. NO HAIR was trapped in the roller…Roomba rollers required combing rollers after each use and was a struggle each time. The carpet appears to rebound better each day…how you can see clearer rows of the fibers AND its predictable pattern it leaves behind is amazing…something my Roombas never did. I can stress how many times I’d be in one room, cooking or what have you, and Roomba in a another room, to just moments later tripping over it randomly…yet constantly…like it’s purpose was to annoy the hell out of me, in which it did. Last thing so amazing about this Shark is the LACK OF NOISE. For something that has WAY MORE SUCTION power and to have a FRACTION OF THE NOISE that my Roombas make. I can barely even hear it running…seriously! Thanks to Prime Day I scored an amazing deal on the cost. But if ever given the choice at having to pay full retail between this and a discount on a Roomba, I’d choose this Shark on any day ending in Y."
5,I love my shark!!,Wonderful for vacuuming the floors on the busy days when you just do not have time!! I still use my upright vacuum maybe once a month for the carpet and to get where this can not go.. I would buy it again!!
5,So much better than expected,"I bought this to supplement my usual vacuuming routine, but I haven't done my own vacuuming since It arrived. My house is all wood flooring and my rugs are all low profile jute or woven style so it really is ideal for this type of vacuum. It's windy where we live and we have a short hair dog. So the daily dust piles up quick. This Shark Robot has exceeded my expectations of keeping the floors free of the daily debris. The app is very simple to use. You can set a time to run or you can start on command to do whichever rooms you want. You can also select a spot clean if you have a high traffic area that needs more attention. I would buy this agin, happy with my purchase."
5,Replaced my old iRobot Roomba S9+ and I am more than happy!!!,"My old Roomba S9+ had basically decided it wasn't really a vacuum any more. It would just trundle around a bit and then get stuck somewhere. I had replaced tires, one of the wheel assemblies, even the battery, and it was still more stuck than vacuuming... Wasn't really expecting the Shark to be much better, but boy, was I WRONG! The Shark - I named mine ""Jaws"" - is way better! It is quieter, doesn't get stuck, seems to vacuum logically and not charge around in seemingly random patterns, and the self-empty feature works very, very well. I have emptied the bin a few times now, and it is clear Jaws is doing a very good job. I like that this vac has TWO brushes, one on each side, unlike the single side brush of the Roomba. I bought replacement side brushes and the main center brush, but so far have no reason to replace either. Only time I've had an issue, was when Jaws swept up a small twig that couldn't make it into the bin container - it was obvious from the change in sound. I have Jaws programed to start cleaning at 6AM and most often has completed my 2000 sq ft first floor by 10-10:30AM. Very happy with this unit. Recommended."
5,Great time and back saver!,"We are so glad we bought this...very impressed from the first run on...we are 5 days into having consistently clean floors and carpets. We both have back issues and vacuuming and sweeping every day has been a problem for us. We have three long hair cats and both of us have long hair so it has been a struggle to keep the floors hair and cat gravel free.
Our house is single story 1200 sq ft and here is our experience with the robot. It took a couple of days for the robot to learn our house....be patient with this little dude, he'll get it pretty fast and you can use the room settings to send him to any room he doesn't catch at first. I set the vacuum every morning to pick up the cat gravel in the laundry room and to freshen the kitchen. The cats are not afraid of this unit at all and they are terrified of the loud upright vacuum. He picks ups the crystal gravel tracked out of the box by the cats without any trouble.....our stick vacuum shoots the heavy gravel around the room....this robot picks it right up. We used ultra clean the first two days to get a deep clean....be sure to set the Evacuate and Resume and the Recharge and Resume features to On in the app....it took a recharge and two empties for the ultra clean setting doing the whole house the first day. We did find that hair was trapped in the wheel mechanism after 2 days of ultra clean and 1 day of regular clean ...the robot told us (yes it talks) to check under the unit.....and we had to remove hair from the wheel axle area.....so we will check this area every few days with daily use. We just let it do its thing during a clean...don't move it or touch it....it gets around everything on its own...hasn't gotten stuck at all....goes around cat toys, under our couch, and over floor register covers and thresholds. We do a quick check of the floors before we unleash the kraken....we have seen pictures in reviews of floors with all kinds of obstacles for the robot to have to move around (usually with poor reviews) ..can't imagine you would get a good result in that case but if your floors are picked up and there is a good path through every room you should be very happy with the work it does. We do not have three feet on either side for docking as recommended and were a little worried about that.....but docking has never been a problem....he has plenty of room in front to line up to the dock. A seriously great tool for any household!"
5,Not bad,This was a first run thru after mapping. I remapped because I didn’t do it right the first time. It didn’t give me a problem what so ever. What I’m surprised about is how long it takes to vacuum my whole house 100 min for 1500sqft. Living room instead takes like 75. Which is where all the dog and cat hair are. I have it scheduled to vacuum the living room everyday. Overall I’m happy.
5,I love not having to sweep the whole house!,"I have a stick vacuum to spot clean my house BUT, sometimes the whole house needs a cleanup as when there's a layer of duster where you don't walk.

The first mission it does it to map out your house, as you see in the picture.
From there, you can select a room to clean or just do the whole house.

I love coming home to a cleaner home.
It even gets under the bed!

It does tend to bump around into things and will get caught on the smallest of obstacle but it does what it can.

It will choke on ear buds, get stuck on things so you'll have to identify those obstacles and remove them so you don't have issues.

When it docks to recharge, it sucks out the junk it has collected into a bin you can shake out into the trash bin so, no bags to purchase. Love that."
5,"Best Robot I've Had, Just Remember It's Not a Human!","I've had multiple robot vacuums and this one is by far the best. We have three large shedding dogs so I run it basically all day long. If I wait too long I will need to get hair out of the bottom roller, and you do need to move obvious things out of the way but it's ability to go over large cords and navigate small doorway bumps and things is quite impressive.
Negatives: 1) if you have more than one floor it can only keep a map of one floor, and 2) you can only have it do a timed run (for example, while you're asleep) for the entire map, not specific rooms. Other than that, I really love it and I'm quite particular.
The 60-day bin only lasts a few weeks for us, but that's expected given the massive amounts of dog hair, and totally fine with me. Overall very, very happy with it--just need two more for each level of the house (it's one story but two rooms are one or two steps down)."
5,thank you thank you thank you!!!,"first off, I like to thank shark, and anyone else involved in the dream come true development of this robot. Second of all, I would like to thank Amazon for the amazing deal I got on it. To say more: I named my robot Xara. I set up routines in my Alexa app for her to run for me every night. And even though she’s an inanimate object, I still thank her for doing such a good job for me every night. I can’t thank shark and Amazon and Xara enough, it’s quite overwhelming. when I bought her, I bought the kit with the replacement parts and filters, and I noticed that the side brushes that they have in the kit, is better than the one that she came with. So I wish that those types of brushes would come with the vacuum. even if it is just one. It does a better cleaning job, then the one that she came with. Other than that, everything’s good. I do a full cleaning maintenance for her every month. And she’s worked like a charm for the past two months. the only issue I have, other than the minor, one with the side brush, is how, inaccessible the shark clean app is. I was able to connect her to my Wi-Fi, connect her to the app, and connect her to my Alexa. But the only way , I can use her to clean on the correct settings, is through the routines section in my Alexa app. I can understand why the map, in the rooms option of the app would be inaccessible for me, because I’m blind, but it claims to have a whole host of other features, but I can’t access any of those either, because, voiceover doesn’t recognize whatever’s on the screen. I prefer her to clean on Max, but when I go into the app under clean, I can swipe around and see the different power levels, but clicking on them does nothing. And if I just do direct touch, it doesn’t even show me the different power levels, it just says power level. So I have a lot of trouble with the app. I have tried using the Alexa skill, by giving Alexa commands, and that worked for a few days, but then it started crashing and having a lot of problems with that, so that’s when I started using the routines in the Alexa app. Now everything works flawlessly."
5,Great robot but here is some advice,"Here are some thoughts/suggestions that I haven’t seen in other reviews.

We are very pleased with robo/vac which takes 90 min. to clean our 1300 sq foot (one floor) condo with hard wood floors. It is especially fun watching it on the first couple of runs as it “figures” things out and maps the area.

While I had 5 ft in front of the home station, I only have 2 ft. on each side and that works just fine.

It is a good idea to go from room to room ahead of time and make sure the vac can access everywhere you want which may mean moving a few things, pulling up corner of bed spreads, remove problematic small rugs, sweep dust/dirt away from hard to access places, etc.

I don’t know why the instructions don’t tell you this: You can operate the robot vacuum initially to see if it is working OK without downloading the app by just using the buttons on top of it. Push the “clean” button on top and the vac will make it’s first run, so you can check to be sure it is functioning properly.

If the vac continues to clean longer than necessary, just push the “dock” button on top and it will stop what it is doing and return to the home station. Be sure to let it recharge completely after it returns to the home station.

The robot vac will not get everything on the first run. It takes 2-3 runs to get a more complete map of the rooms.

The app contains some useful features. For one thing, you can name the rooms on the map (Menu—>map—>Edit map—>+Add. Move the highlight by hand and size it to the room, then click on “label,” select appropriate name, and click on save.

Initially, the robot stopped exactly after one hour and returned to its home station before it has finished. I found that if I go to the app’s Menu—>settings—>your robot—>”Recharge and Resume is on,” which is a setting for places larger than 1800 sq ft. I had to turn “Recharge and Resume to off,” so that it would do the entire 1300 sq ft in one run before returning to its home base. Later after the vac finish, it went back to some rooms a second time. I found that in the settings, ""Extended clean is on"" so I turned it off. Again, these are features you find in the app.

The first time I connected the vac to Wifi, it went smoothly, but after a couple of weeks, it failed to reconnect. I tried all the instructions for reconnecting, but it failed to connect. I found that I had to delete the robot on the app and start over with instructions to connect to the app. That worked and the map was not deleted along with the vac."
5,So Far I Love This Little Vacuum,"I have only been using this for about a week now so I cannot speak to the longevity of it - I will update later if my opinion changes. But, so far I love this robot vacuum.
Setting it up was super easy and once it was done mapping the area I use it in I was able to separate out the area into different rooms - very helpful when you only want one or two areas done or if you want one or two done more frequently.
The best part is I can turn it on from my phone which has been great so far. I simply set it up to clean while I am out and about and I come home to a cleaner house.
It does fairly well with hair but I have not used the deep clean function yet so my guess is it will do even better on that mode.
It has gotten stuck on one rug that had a thread out but it simply paused there and the app alerted me there was an issue. It was easy enough to find the vacuum, unclog the thread and put the vacuum back in its dock.
The auto empty is great as well but it only lasts about 5 cleans before the bin needs to be emptied. Although the title does say 60-days I am happy to empty it more often as it means the vacuum is picking up lots of dirt and hair.
I held off for a long time before getting a robot vacuum but I am so happy to have one now."
5,Does what it’s supposed to do,"This robot vacuum does its job as long as you do your part as well. Make sure the floors are clear of big debris objects and cords and you should have no issues. The only time the robot ever got stuck was when I left socks or cords laying out, go figure. It’s surprising how much dust and debris is emptied out of the container when I do empty it. It picks up under my couch and other places I might have otherwise missed when sweeping. I got it on sale for when it was nearly half off but I wouldn’t mind paying full price after owning it for a few months."
5,Best Robot Vac yet !!,"I have a long history with robotic vacuum cleaners dating back to the early red color iRobot units. From that to a newer iRobot then to the Dyson back to another iRobot and now this Shark IQ with self empty base.
I have found the iRobot units to wear out their brush modules rather quickly requiring you to purchase their 'upgraded' module as a replacement. My question is why don't they include the 'upgraded' module from the start if it's so much better ??
Also, they seem to have a difficult time finding the docking station to recharge. Out latest iRpbot was maddening trying to get it in just the right position so it would charge. Moving it just a fraction of an inch one way or the other was an exercise in frustration so it would charge.
The Dyson Eye was a great unit which mapped the rooms and did a great job on cleaning. Always found the recharging base and the only reason we still don't have it is Dyson recalled them all as they feel there was a design flaw. They did a total refund including all taxes and shipping on the unit. I can't speak highly enough about their customer service and how we were treated as customers with Dyson. I was hoping that they would have introduced their next generation unit as we would have certainly purchased it.
That brings us to the Shark IQ. We've had it about a month now and are quite pleased with it. It has superior suction to the iRobot models we've owned, does a good job of creating a map of the house and NEVER has a problem finding its charging base.
The self cleaning feature of the base is great and totally removes all the debris from the robot. The base is easy to say the least to clean. Just press a button to release the canister, walk it over to the trash, press the 'open' button and out comes all the debris it picked up.
We have several dogs, A Husky which seems to shed year round and a German Shepherd and the robot keeps ALL of the loose fur cleaned up nicely. It transitions well from hard floor surfaces to carpet and does a better than iRobot job on carpets.
Best of all, the beater bar on the Shark IQ NEVER gets hair wrapped around it unlike the iRobot!! iRobot 'solves' the hair wrap problem by selling a tool which you have to use to clean the hair off of the bar. Why not just make a design change like Shark has ??
The Shark app is easy to use and set up schedules or manually start, stop, or instruct the robot to return to its base. We have also enabled the Shark skill on our Amazon Alexa devices which gives us full control over the unit as well. I have read reviews which state the Shark is too loud but I find it to be lower in volume than any of the other robots we have owned. There are different settings for the amount of vacuum suction power and even on the MAX setting, it's not loud at all.
All in all, I would definitely make the purchase again and highly recommend the unit over any other robot (except for maybe the next generation Dyson!)"
5,Amazing,"If I had Walmart to describe this vacuum, it would be amazing. It sucks up bigger stuff than I thought it would. Super easy to clean and I love that it’s backless you literally empty it like you would a regular vacuum. The only issue we had was getting it mapped correctly for our house. We had to do it a few times to make sure it went everywhere but after about the third time it was mapped perfectly and it keeps my house super clean!"
5,Picks up dog hair daily,"When I bought this, I was actually going to send it back at first because I was thinking it wasn’t working well. After running it daily for two weeks (not emptying the bin) the amount of dog hair that this thing picked up that I had no idea was even on the floor, is actually disgusting. Definitely a keeper. At first, my dog was terrified of it and now he won’t leave it alone."
5,Excellent Vacuum,"We had a older entry level robot vacuum that did not have any bells or whistles - it just moved around aimlessly and turned when it ran into something. There was no mapping, room assignment, etc. It was always getting stuck in places and became more trouble than it was worth. We loved the idea of being able to vacuum at regularly scheduled times to fit our family's schedule and as needed. We have a large dog that stays inside and she sheds a lot, so vacuuming daily would be preferred to keep dog hair in control. After a lot of research I settled on getting this shark robot vacuum. It is just what we were looking for, and it does a great job vacuuming (good suction). It mapped out whole house accurately, and with room assignments and marking specific areas as ""no go"" zones, it does a perfect job. Get this when it is on sale and you have a great product well worth the price. I highly recommend it!"
5,Immediate peace of mind!,"I am so happy with this purchase. The setup of the vacuum was incredibly easy, and the app walks you through the whole process. The mapping of the house was pretty accurate, and after only 2 full cleans it has even gotten to more spots in the rooms. Being able to schedule the cleaning is a huge weight off my shoulders. I'm starting my day with the floor already taken care of. The vacuum is decently quiet. I was able to watch TV while it was running no problem. It even let me know when a cat toy was stuck in the roller and it needed help.

It takes about 2 hours right now for the robot to clean the entire floor, about 1,200 square feet. As it learns the environment I'm sure that will improve. It is able to easily find its dock when it needs to empty or recharge. I love that, if the robot needs to charge in the middle of cleaning, it automatically picks right back up where it left off when it's ready to go.

I had a different model of robot vacuum years ago and it didn't work that well, so I've been hesitant to get another one. I'm so glad I decided to make this purchase!"
5,I have 7 animals!!,"2dogs over 100lbs, two long hair cats, 2 rabbits(yes they free roam with the cats and dogs) as well as lizards, fish and two humans. My only complaint is it doesn’t hold a full 60 days like it says but most people don’t have so much hair in their house😂😂 I have it set to run daily and I empty it about every 2-3weeks otherwise it gets clogged and won’t hold anymore. It has a clear window so I can see how full it is and that’s definitely a huge help at keeping it from getting clogged."
5,This little thing has been fun,"My cats harass the heck out of this poor horse shoe crab of a cleaning robot. That being said, I absolutely love it. It's not perfect and it has its flaws but it's somthing I can look past because the results of its hard work are glorious. I enjoy that I can mark no go zones aswell as have it spot clean. The app leaves alot to be desired and the small changes they could do really wouldn't be that bad. If you have a long haired cat, the 60 day dirt holder and robots dirt holder arnt gonna last. I empty its dirt holder out once a week because the base just can't suck the hair out but I think for most people this robot will be great. The first few weeks can be rough learning what it will and won'teat. That you left on the floor, what it will get stuck on and ect."
5,love this robot,this little robot works very well. when your 81 years it is saving a lot of back acks and really does a good job. shark is the best brand. i have 2 of them...the self-empty ones
5,Great cleaning companion!,"I’m writing this review after 5 days of use.
We started years ago with a Deebot that was such a pain we threw it out. The last 2 years we’ve had an Eufy 11S that ran 1-2 times a day and we really liked it. We decided to move the Eufy to the basement and get something self emptying and easy to schedule because I now travel for work.
The shark was extremely easy to setup. It’s first run was impressive, no ping ponging around the house randomly, it worked methodically back and forth in rows. It seems to get smarter every day and the map was pretty complete after just a couple of runs. I like that I can see exactly where it ran in the app as well.
I did empty the base after The first run just out of curiosity. I emptied it again today so the picture here is from 4 days.
The picture of the bottom is today after 5 runs. I haven’t touched it. Our deebot and Eufy had to be cleaned after every run, usually with scissors to get the hair off the roller.
I have 4 dogs. One is a mastiff who sheds a massive amount and another is a mutt who also sheds a lot of undercoat. We have 3 acres and the dogs are in/out all day long tracking dirt in.
I used to run the Eufy twice a day but had to start it manually (I gave up on trying to use their app). Now that I travel for work I would get home on the weekend and find my husband and daughter forgot to run it most days. Now I can come home knowing it’s clean.
We have vinyl plank flooring. My office has an area rug. We also have a few throw rugs. It has only gotten stuck once under our plant stand which is next to its base. I think the battery just ran out. The Eufy was always getting stuck on a rug, under the fridge or on something random.
I also can’t believe how quiet it is. I run it on the highest power and am able to be on conference calls. It even self emptied while on a call and I asked and no one heard it.
I’ve scheduled it for 7am and was pleasantly surprised how quiet it is. Didn’t even wake us up on Sunday when we wanted to sleep in.
There is only an option to schedule once a day though. I think if we have a really dirty day I could run manually in the afternoon or evening.
Our main floor is around 1300 sq ft. It seems to clean 770-950 each time which makes sense with furniture (and my daughters bedroom door is nearly always closed).
This is well worth the money and I’m so happy with it so far."
5,Great Vacuum!,"Play Video
I’m so impressed! Have seen these for years! Resisting the urge to purchase and finally broke down when I got this one 50% off. Wish I had done it sooner.

Some have said it is loud. To me, it isn’t. I can hear my TV over it but I turned the sound down so you could actually hear it.

Unboxed and within 10 minutes I was set up. I have StarLink Internet and live out in the country.

Your internet service may be the reason for some having issues during WiFi connect.

I did let it charge a good 8 hours before trying to connect to my phone and then it wasn’t until a couple days later I did the “mapping”. The video I showed was it doing that procedure. This thing is AMAZING.

Within 25 minutes the areas I wanted mapped were done!

It returned to the dock and emptied out the empty out procedure is a little louder but I expected that. I didn’t initially map each bedroom. I closed the door to any areas I didn’t want mapped.

We actually have a pretty high threshold between the kitchen and living area but it made it over no problem!!

If you have been waiting, DON’T! We don’t have children at home and only 1 small chihuahua dog so it doesn’t get too dirty but getting older I just don’t have the energy for cleaning every few days anymore!

So glad I purchased this!"
5,Love this Robo Vac!,Bought this after having a Roomba and there is no comparison. The Shark vac performs above and beyond the Roomba we had.
5,It vacuums while I watch TV. 5 stars!,"What can I say about my robot son Marvin? Is he perfect? No, but what child is? Have I had to unwedge him from underneath a dining room chair a time or two? Of course, but who of us hasn’t had a similar experience after a particularly rousing weekend with friends? Have I come to love him like a member of my own family? Absolutely! In all seriousness, if you are someone who wants every nook and cranny cleaned every time you vacuum, no robot vacuum will be right for you. One of the main caveats to adopting a robot vacuum is that your furniture placement remain largely the same forever. So, your Shark will not be able to get into every corner, and you will see this. And as the tips suggest, picking up any non permanent objects will be immensely helpful in your Shark being able to make an accurate map of your floor plan. I even make sure our dirty clothes baskets are basically in the same place every time Marvin runs so that he doesn’t get confused. (One time he trapped himself in a corner of the bedroom because he first pushed the empty laundry basket out from under the bed, and then went behind it.) So there’s a learning curve for both human and robot participant. But I now have a good prep routine and it’s literally a 5 minute sweep of the house making sure everything is where it should be. I have a feeling this may be part of the problem for some people who say it seems like their Shark can’t get an accurate map no matter how often they run it. ALL NON PERMANENT OBSTACLES NEED TO BE PICKED UP. This is crucial. That being said, it will take your Shark quite a while to make a complete map of your home. I have appreciated one update to the app, which now shows the ongoing process of the map being made. This is helpful because you can now see if there seems to be a problem area for your Shark and you can correct it early on in it’s mapping process. I do wish you could manually program one room at a time. Currently, you tell your Shark to clean, and until it has a complete map of your home, it can only do an “entire house” clean. Even though it would be a little time consuming at first, I feel like it would be helpful if you could put your shark in an area, label it whatever, and then have it map that specific area. I feel like this would also help you ensure you’re getting a more accurate map. But, at this point, that isn’t an option. So the mapping does take a while. On actual cleaning ability, I feel like the suction is fine. It does tend to blow lighter dust around a bit and so sometimes dust bunnies can get missed because they get blown out of the current cleaning path. But I definitely feel like my floors are clean after Marvin makes his rounds. I also strongly suggest buying the self emptying base. It is a bit loud when it kicks on, but it is simply more convenient than you having to empty the little compartment on your own. The bottom line is, he vacuums while I watch TV, and so in my book, that earns him 5 stars."
5,Great Robot,"I bought this robot vacuum to clean my floors after I broke my foot. I had a little trouble downloading the app; but once I got that done, I mapped out the house and put it to work. It did a great job of maneuvering around the rooms and left them looking nice and clean. I resolved one situation that happened in the middle of the night that woke me up. I thought I heard someone in the house and immediately woke up my husband. We heard the noise again, and I grapped my cell phone ready to call 911 while he got up to investigate. Right away he found ""Bruce"" in the office hard at work cleaning the floor. We got a big laugh out of that, but the next morning I opened up the app and found that I could set up a ""do not disturb"" time, which of course I did. I would definitely recommend this vacuum. It even knows when to go back to the base to empty when it's full, then go right back to work. Excellent value for the money. I also bought it when it was on sale."
5,Technology,We can’t live without it. Set to auto at 12pm daily. Excellent
5,Does a great job,"So have watched these machines since they came out. All makes and all models. Wondered just how capable they were at REALLY cleaning well. After all they can be very expensive. What features are a must? Will they really NOT fall down the stairs?

We have a few friends with different brands and have watched them all. Most are at least a couple of years old or older. Most do not have the self empty dock. Most just run randomly around the house, miss spots,go over some other places multiple times and they don’t seem that efficient. Even most of the owners aren’t really impressed with their purchases.

Now comes the Shark IQ R1001AE. Oh and prime day!!

Bit the bullet and ordered one. I must say we are quite impressed!

Unboxing and setup is extremely easy. READ the directions and follow them and all goes well. Download app, set up dock and place the robot there. LET IT CHARGE to full THEN send it out for its maiden voyage. Ours hooked up the first time to WiFi and the interactive app is easy to setup and navigate. It has push notifications to alert you should it find that lost sock under the bed or dresser and suck it up. It allows you to send it to specific rooms should you choose or perform a total house cleaning. Also you can through the app, schedule days and/or times for it to rum.

The robot needs to run 3full runs to “map” the house. Then you can go in the app to the map and “make” and name the rooms. The more the robot runs the more efficient it gets. We’ve had our about a month and a half and now one day it will run the rooms north and south, the next time east and west. It make nice straight lines in the carpet and it’s easy to tell it’s not missing a strip. Our other vacuum is a Dyson Animal and a one a week cleaning with”it” yields a good amount of debris in the bin. We do have animals. Now with the robot running a couple time a week there is hardly anything in the Dyson.

There are 3 suction modes, eco, normal and “super suck”. Our house is 1400 sq ft and on normal it will head to the dock 3 times to empty and will have to recharge before it finishes. However after about 3-4 hours it will resume on its own to finish. We now run it in eco mode. It will finish the entire house easily with a single charge and still does a really great job.

The no clogging brush roll is a true. There are no “bristles “ on the brush roll and it so far has not had anything stuck to it except the occasional panty hoe or nerf dart or hair tie.

All in all we are really impressed with “this” robot vacuum and I do recommend it highly."
5,A Must Have Product for Semi-Lazy Households (READ THIS BEFORE SETUP),"Ever since Christmas Eve when I was probably 12, I’ve never been so excited to have a product show up at my door. I check my front porch every 20 minutes on the day my Shark was supposed to arrive, just to see if it had came in yet, but that’s beside the point. When unboxing it, it was very heavily protected by packaging, so I wasn’t worried at all about it being tore up during shipping. After setting up the “Home Station/Dust Bin Base” I started with the actual setup within the app. I kept on running into issues when trying to merge the vacuum’s WiFi broadband, to my actual WiFi. I read plenty of stuff online saying “Restart Robot, Restart Wifi, Restart Phone” and none of that worked. The vacuum must be connected to a 2.4gHz WiFi broadband, not 5g, but that still wasn’t my issue. I read a Reddit thread saying that someone had tried it on and iPad (I was using iPhone), and it worked flawlessly. So I charged up my iPad and downloaded the app, tried setup again, and it worked just fine. It took me every bit of an hour and a half to figure it out, which almost had me pull my hair out, but it worked out in the end. Kind of inconvenient that I needed to use my $1200 iPad to finish setup, but it worked. I started my first clean and it takes several times throughout the house to get the pattern down, but it works just fine. We have a $500 Samsung vacuum that we thought was the bees knees, but this shark put it to shame. Having the shark clean our home on a routinely basis has also helped up maintain a cleaner lifestyle as we now make sure that we don’t leave random stuff sitting around the house on the floor. I’ve only ran it through maybe 4 or 5 times so this is a fresh review, but I will post an update. Charging takes a while, I would guess a few hours of charging from a completely dead battery, and it used about 60-70% of the battery cleaning our 1200 +/- sq ft home. The transition from hardwood to carpet and or rugs was no issue at all. Definitely impressed, but will still vacuum manually every once in a while to a help make this vacuum live a long life."
5,My Most Favorite Purchase Ever,"I don't know if I've ever left an amazon review, and I am a prolific user, but this is probably the best purchase I have ever made. I had one of the OG Shark robot vacuums that was about 6 years old and stopped holding a charge. This Shark was on sale so I went with it and the improvements that have been made since the first one I had are amazing. I love that it maps the room and you can choose places it can't go. I love that you can just clean one room. My dogs hair and my hair do not get caught in the brush roll at all. And the best part of all, I don't have to empty it. It self empties once half way through a run and then at the end. It is much more thorough than my last one and has not gotten stuck where as my old one did. I cannot express enough how much I love this vacuum especially the price I paid compared to competitors."
5,It has made my life easier especially with having pets,I absolutely love my machine thank you thank u
4,After 6 months & shed season,"TLDR: Been a lifesaver on hard floors, not a replacement for vacuuming on carpets. You do have to clean the vacuum parts every once in a while. will get stuck on fabrics on the ground (clothes, dryer sheets, etc)

After having this for about 6 months I would recommend the vacuum for someone who has a lot of hard floors or regular dry messes but not to someone with spills or a lot of carpet-to-wood floor changes if they have heavy shedders. It's helped tremendously with the dust in our house as long as we clean the dust filter regularly.

With shedding: We have three almost 100 lb dogs which are heavy shedders and live in a very dusty place. We run it every day and even through shed season, our floors looked great! It doesn't get the hair as much off our carpet so we still vacuum the carpets once a week or every other week. If we had done that before it would have looked like a hair storm went through our house! The brush roll did get stuck quite a bit at first but some WD40 and popping both ends off the roller to clean them helped. One end of the roller does not want to come off at first but once you get it, it's easy to clean. With the 60-day tank, we dump it about twice a month so I think for a normal household it would last 60 days.

Initial setup: it was frustrating because it didn't map the house how I wanted it to. I must've mapped the house 4 times before getting one that was similar to ours. It helps to push the manual button to clean and it helps it map much better.

Carpet vs hard flooring: It functions great on all our tile, wood flooring, and even cement( escaped into our garage one day when on ""clean mode"" not mapped). The main issue we've had is the transition onto the carpet, the brush roll cleans off all the hair so all the rooms we have carpet in now have a line of dog hair entering the room. I think it would be pretty good for someone who has fewer dogs. Once it's on the carpet it works great, even makes those lines in the carpet. Picks up dirt very well on carpet and hard flooring.

Noise: It's a background noise when vacuuming much like a dishwasher but when it's clearing the vacuum dustbin into the base it sounds like a normal vacuum.

App: works great. I do wish there was a feature to run certain rooms every day or different areas on different schedules. I think it would help a lot with the carpet-to-hardwood hair issue."
4,"Navigation is excellent - dustbin cleanout, not so much.","We just received the robot yesterday, February 3, 2023, so this is a preliminary review. Setup was straightforward as was connection to wifi and the app on my phone. My biggest concerns are with the app, not the Robot itself.

First, there are few directions within the app. Thus I had to search through the various menus and randomly press buttons in an effort to find something. Then on several occasions I found the item I wanted to find wouldn't show up at all until the robot completed it's first full cleaning. It's a learning curve I know, but they could have helped a lot more than they did.

Then after the robot completed the first cleaning, magically, a map of the house appeared and once I got the image turned rightside up, it was simple to name the rooms. But herein lies a small issue. The app provides a list of room labels to choose from, but there appears to be no provision for customizing names. Hence, my wife's sewing room became the ""Playroom.""

I knew there was a place to set the robot's suction power (Eco, Normal, Max) and after 20 minutes of re-searching, I found it. However the setting appears to apply to all the rooms to be cleaned. This is fine if you have all carpet or all smooth surfaces. Most of our floors are smooth but the master bedroom is a rather deep pile carpet.

The app allows you to name each room and send the robot off to clean all, several, or just one. This is nice. But having that capability without the ability to set the suction level for each room separately seems rather brain-dead!

That's my compaints so far. Lets move on to the more positive aspects of the robot.

I mentioned, the fairly deep pile carpet in the bedroom. The robot handled it with aplomb. There was a noticeable change in speed and ease of operation but it pushed through without a whimper. I had it on normal power and would prefer ""Max,"" but will try that later.

The map it produced was remarkably good for a single cleaning run and I could easily determine which room was which, once I got it rightside up.

"" a single cleaning run"" could be misleading. Two full charges were needed to complete the cleaning. The app does provide a decent report of the robots activity. It started cleaning at 9:56 am, then briefly docked 30 min. later (orientation ??) and resumed cleaning after emptying its dust bin. The battery ran low (about 30%) after 83 minutes of cleaning time. 3 hr. and 15 min. were required for the battery to recharge. It then cleaned (with an intermediate docking) for nearly 2 hours where it died in our bathroom with 5% charge showing in the app. We carried it back to the docking station where it exhausted the debris and began recharging. 6.5 hours were required from staart to finish. This isn't good, or bad, It;s just information for you.

The app says 2276 sq ft were cleaned. This is about twice too much. About 1350 sq ft (gross outside dimensions) were available, but that includes closets, furniture, bathtubs, etc that block the robot. I did notice that it systematically recleaned numerous areas on the second charge, So I don't think their numbers are wrong, just duplicated.

Its ability to navigate appears to be excellent. It does travel in long, precisely straight lines when it can. Though it seems to turn around at about 20 ', regardless. When it approaches a wall or furniture, it will slow and gently tap the barrier, or turn just before reaching the item. It typically turns corners around furniture efficiently, though there is sometimes a bit of wasted spinning around.

Except for the time where it ran out of juice, it effortlessly relocated the dock to recharge and empty the onboard dust bin.

We have a pet cat with 2"" fur, very fine fur, that sheds constantly. There is no reason that cat isn't totally bald! The roller brush and side brushes seemed to handle it well. Both were relatively free of her fur. I know I will have to clean the axels and the roller every few weeks but it should be tolerable.

If I think of it, I'll add to this review at a later date.

So here is an update. It's now April 21, 2023 and I'm still very pleased with the machine. It seems to do a good job on our hard surfaced floors as it seldom misses visible debris. The degree of cleaning on our carpets is harder to know, but the dust bin always contains an abundance of cat hair. Speaking of cat hair, the roller NEVER clogs with cat hair. However, the axles on the roller do collect hair. I have to clean them every 2-3 weeks as the machine stops and says ""my roller is clogged."" That said, the roller axles are very easy to clean. No tools are needed since the roller cover just snaps in and out and the roller then lifts out nicely exposing the axles and housings. Though a small pick is needed to clean one end of the axle.

The shark never gets caught in a corner or tight spot when there is a path out. Our Neato used to get caught frequently for no good reason. The shark has gotten caught a few times on cords, shoe laces etc, and twice has run up on the track of our patio door and gotten stuck but it is vastly better at returning to the base station than our Neato.

I have the ""Extended Clean"" option turned on which tells the Shark to continue cleaning until it needs charging. Lately it has run out of power a few times and had to be manually returned to the base station . I will try it with extended clean ""Off."" This may cause it to take longer to clean the house but may increase reliability.

The attached photo illustrates the depth of pile in our carpet as well as the manner in which it cleans. The shark is quite systematic when cleaning but it does sometimes cover some areas twice.

We have some open grates on our floor and the Shark traverses them without issue. The Neato would stop on them and discontinue cleaning so we had to use the magnetic strips (supplied) to avoid this issue. The shark recognizes the magnetic strips, but they aren't needed for the grates.

I empty the dust bin on the base station probably once every 3 weeks which works fine. That's all for now.

Here's another update,. It is now January 10, 2024 and the Shark has 11 months under it's belt. It started doing weird things/errors after about 6 months so I replaced the battery which was needed with our Neato and it took care of our problem. It continues to perform well until it picks up a small rock or pea sized chunk of dog food, which happens frequently now that we were forced to change our little dog's food for medical reasons. The shark does pick up these items but they fail to exhaust into the dustbin and lodge either in the throat of the dustbin or get stuck in the spring loaded door on the Shark. When that happens an error occurs and the shark ceases operation. This issue is simple to fix. However the most annoying thing is after clearing the blockage, the Shark doesn't pickup where it left off. I have to select the rooms that were missed (very nice capability by the way) and tell it to start cleaning again.

May 14, 2024
The shark, as near as I can tell continues to function normally. However, the dustbin's failure to empty and subsequent error messages that prevent the unit from continuing to clean has finally pushed me over the edge. It is rare that the entire set of rooms get vacuumed. Most days I have to restart the machine at least once during the cleaning cycle and then it ""forgets"" where to restart. The bottom line is it's too frustrating to use now and it's going in the trash."
4,New to Robot Vacuums,"Since I can't leave a 4.5 out of 5 stars, I'll go ahead and just round down and here is why:

Let me first preface this by saying I had a huge bias against purchasing a robot vacuum. I honestly thought they were useless, unable to adequately clean the house, and would be built to be more of a remote control car than an actual cleaning device.

Well....Prime Day comes along, and this bad boy is on sale, and I figured I'd take a shot at it. I have a husky, and I spend most of my evenings sweeping the floor - CONSTANTLY. It would get so bad, especially during the summers where I'd just be exhausted from work, gym, and dinner that I would avoid sweeping until the next day or the day after. I eventually transitioned to using my vacuum, which helped a little, but I found myself going through the process of still sweeping, then vacuuming to pick up any missed particles of hair, fuzz, or dust.

So...I bought this guy, and omg it's been a godsend. I run this bad boy every three days, and my house is noticeably cleaner and smells better. I can literally relax and play with my dog while the robot is cruising around the house picking up everything!. I was impressed by the amount it picked up. As a result of the frequency, I find less and less hair/dirt/fuzz on the floor. Don't get me wrong, I still use my broom and hand held vacuum, but that's usually on the weekends when I do a much deeper clean of the home. However, it takes less time because there is so much less mess on the floor. I still speculate that the robot isn't 100%, but I guess neither am I. HAHAHA

Pros:
- Cleans my 900 sqft home in about 40 minutes. Able to pick up dust, fur, dirt, and crumbs from the floor with no issues. (haven't tried larger objects)
- The wheels are like hidden monster truck wheels and are independent of each other so that it can traverse over carpet and other slightly elevated areas.
- The app allows a full map of your house, as well as creating or sectioning off your home so that the if you want to vacuum specific areas (in my case the kitchen and game room where my husky usually sleeps or hangs out) it will clean the area and be done.
- The speed settings are pretty nifty too, and can be adjusted to get a much thorough cleaning.

Cons:
- This could be my fear, but due to the warning about liquids on the floor, I have to do a preclean to make sure there isn't spots of drool from my dog, or areas where I may have dropped water from washing dishes, etc. I also have to ensure that all the wires, and stuff on the floor are put away to make sure the robot doesn't get caught.
- The battery seems a little bit of a drain. One cleaning reduces the battery all the way to 60%, not sure if that's normal, but I figured since it's new, it'll be at maybe 80% or have a power save function.
- The collecting bin should come with some cleaning instruction, I want to make sure this bad boy stays with me for a long while, so I like to learn how to keep the seal that keeps the bin closed tight, remains in tact. It's made of like a soft sponge material, and feel it'll degrade after a few dumps (we'll see).
- After researching a few models, I wish this also had the swiffer pad attachment or something so that it could polish or mop the floor as well. I know it doesn't always pick up the super tiny dust bunnies, but that pad would be amazing

Overall, I give it a solid 90%. I've only had it for a little over a month, and I hope I have many years with this thing. If you haven't given a robot vacuum a try, I'd definitely recommend it....coming from someone that despised them."
4,Senior Citizens Little Helper,"Arrived on time. Packaged very well. Sale price was awesome. I purchased the vacuum two weeks ago and wanted to wait before I made a fair review.
The first thing you do is plug it in to finish charging up the battery. I didn't use it until the next day. In the meantime, download the app and connect the vacuum to the internet. This was the most difficult part for me. It kept saying to reboot the modem, reboot the vacuum, reboot... But after several times, it finally did connect to the wifi, so be patient. The app itself is user friendly. I played around with it just to figure it all out. (And you get to name your vacuum as this point.) The next day, I let Jaws map the house. He was fun to watch as he went from room to room, turning, stopping and going, spinning and looking around. After he finished mapping, he went back to the dock. This is when you label the rooms and make no-go zones in the app. Just a tip about no-go zones. Pinch the map to make the area larger so you can clearly see exactly where you want to put the no-go zone--otherwise it's too small to see where you want it. Once you are satisfied with that, you can send him out to clean a single room, multiple rooms or the entire house. And you can choose the power level of cleaning. In settings, there are a few other choices like do not disturb, recharge and resume, evacuate and resume, etc. I sent Jaws out to clean a room at a time just so I could see where he went, what he cleaned and if he missed any areas. When that was all done, I realized that I had to remap the house again. This is a minor flaw with the app. You have to map the entire house and can't map one room at a time. There were some areas that he missed but I think it was more my fault than his. In the app, trying to distinguish exactly where one room ends and another begins is not exact. Instead of labeling every single room, for instance, I made my master bedroom with adjoining bathroom and adjoining walk-in closet as one huge room. I did that also for the guest bedroom--the hallway and guest bathroom and the guest bedroom were mapped as one room. You will know what I mean once you are actually in the app and mapping and labeling your rooms. But if you want to, you can label every single room, large or small, especially if you think any of those rooms need a touch up more than others. By the way, after cleaning three fairly large rooms, the battery only went down to about 70%. The vacuum picks up surface dirt: crumbs, dust bunnies, cat fur and litter, etc., and some deep stuff. I still own a regular vacuum for very deep cleaning but now use it less often. Otherwise, I use Jaws every day. I am a senior citizen and don't want to spend my retirement thinking about dragging out the big vacuum. I love it. You learn after a few runs what you need to pick up or move out of the way beforehand. I found that out after Jaws went into the kitchen for the first time and attacked the cat food and water bowls. But you learn all this as you go along. I ended up making about five maps all together before I was totally satisfied knowing that most, if not all, of the rooms were getting cleaned. For some reason, it misses a very small 2'x2' corner in my bedroom. Doesn't want to go over there. It might have something to do with a no-go zone close by. Rather than make another map of the ENTIRE house, I am ok with the map that I ended up with. Other than that small area, he cleans the rest of the house to my satisfaction. Jaws spoke to me today and said to clean the filter. There was a clump of dust bunnies and cat fur blocking the poop door. Smart fellow. Almost forgot: I attempted to set it up with Alexa to use verbal commands but for some reason, it wouldn't work for me. I could have spent more time trying to figure it out but it's just as easy for me to use the app. Money well spent. I also purchased a two-year warranty so I'll end up with three years of protection. And I bought a kit of replacement parts, filters, etc. No regrets. Jaws and I have become good friends even if he wants to eat the cat food."
4,First impression is this thing is very clunky.,"Update to the update...
So now this thing is working better. You've got to let this thing charge like 100%. Let it map the house. Then it works pretty good. It got stuck a couple times on some obstacles but I'm not going to knock that. Once you vacuum proof AKA childproof your floor. It'll work fine. Every time it's done vacuuming it dumps itself which is The first time I've ever had a dumping vacuum. It is definitely nice not to bend over and pull that dust bin out all the time with dogs. All in all I'm pretty happy with it. I'm knocking off a star because this thing is clunky. Even brand new it sounds like it's breaking. It's got like a grinding crunching noise when the bar spins underneath the machine. You also can't zoom into maps and see little tracks where the unit has run. Other vacuums has little trails on where the unit went. This just tells you it did that room in general. It would be nice to see the exact route this thing took so I can see if I have to put a no-go zone somewhere. Make sure you get it on sale and it's worth the money. End of story unless it breaks and I'll report back.

Update:
Let it charge over 50% before you use it. When I set it up the app kind of let me run it right away and instead of mapping the house it just started cleaning. I put it back on the charger and let it go to 100%. It seems to charge very very slow compared to my last one.
Once it was 100% charged it did map the house in about 15 mins and then it dumped itself and I set it off to clean. Seems to work pretty good over all. Lots of dog hair and dirt in the hopper. I will report back after a few weeks. So far I am happier than I was when I first got it so we will see.
 
I think it's important to log your first impression so here we go. It was well packaged I was pleased to see that. It takes up a good bit of space in your house so find a nice piece of wall. It had 30% charge when I set it up and for some reason it wanted to get started mapping my house so I let it. I'm coming off of a wyze vacuum cleaner. I had bought it twice from Amazon and I like it but some reason after a year the suction just seems to die down and no matter how much air I blow through it it doesn't seem to clean it out. Thus this replacement. My first thoughts is it's like watching Grandpa walk around when he's lost at home. The thing bumps into everything with no hope of actually having a plan. It still mapping my house so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt. Right now I'm not so impressed with the suction. I don't know if it slow suction down while it maps the house or what. It might be a little early to leave a review but I think it's important again to explain this in detail. Right now I've got a lot of doubt but will give it a couple days and I'll report back. One thing I really don't like is right now when I press dock it went the complete wrong way and decided to not dock. I liked the Waze vacuum cleaner because it went right to its home and knew everything was. I hope this works out better than my first impression."
4,Works great for auto vac,"Works better than expected! Honestly. I have 6 dogs and 4 cats. I need the floor clean d of hair daily, sometimes twice a day. This unit works great as expected. The cons are that you have to clean the floor first LOL. Picking up obviously larger stuff than the vac can eat. Like sticks, plastic ties, whole pieces of dry dog food, that sort of thing, & of course the dog beds and blankets. A quick sweep into the dust pan does most. 2nd not so great thing is it can leave wads of dog hair and dirt. I dunno if it doesn’t realize it needs dumping or it doesn’t “swallow” the stuff past the brushes, but I spend time almost every run cleaning brushes cause it’s stuck w/hair &/or sweeping up the wads leftover. I’m assuming that’s all vacs, not just this one. Like I said, 6 dogs LOL. Other than that, it really helps me keep the gloors decent. I’m disabled and sweeping the house myself isn’t an option. So overall I find the Shark vac extremely helpful & I really like the large tank so I don’t have to dump it daily. Easy to use. Fairly sturdy tho it did argue with a table leg & lost. Now one side is taped on. Battery life good, as advertised ."
4,"Great robot, but app disconnects once in a while","I live with three cats, and I have back pain that limits my movements, so this robot is perfect for me: I mapped the house and there's an area called ""cats"" where their bathrooms are. Every time a cat leaves one of the bathrooms, I scoop and tell the app to clean the cats area. It works phenomenally in that sense. It catches the litter and the hair it finds around. Once in a while I also use it in other areas and works well both in carpet and wood floors. I am happy with the product, in general.

The problem it has is the app. It is experimental, I guess, and has a lot of problems. One of them is that every time I go to the section ""rooms"" to select only my cat area, for some reason it changes to ""hallway."" Every single time. So I have to wait, it changes it, I change it back, and then I can hit ""matrix clean."" (Matrix clean is excellent for the cat area, it doesn't miss a single litter piece). If I am in a hurry, sometimes I have hit ""clean"" and I see it going to the hallway. This is a bit annoying. Also, in the ""rooms"" section, the first thing that appears is a map where you could click the area(s) to be cleaned, but it doesn't work in my app. I have to click a button so it shows it to me in the form of a list - only then can I select rooms.

Yesterday it completely disconnected from my robot. I had to configure it again. Today it disconnected from the account. I had to look for the password and log in again. And now, I went to the app to tell the robot to clean, and the app says ""disconnected."" I am not sure what it means. I hit ""clean"" on the robot itself, and now it is cleaning my whole apartment. The cat area is not well cleaned because I can't ""matrix clean"" it.

So I am kind of frustrated right now. The robot is perfect, the app is a piece of garbage.

I"
4,Good for its price,"Works great, but two complaints. I’ve had this cool robot for 3 months, and it’s great at keeping open spaces clean. However, it doesn’t get the dirt right up against the walls and furniture. Before I let it clean, I have to use a broom to get the stuff at least an inch from the walls. Another thing is that it can’t comprehend any type of plastic. You know those little plastic T- shaped things that come on products to keep the tag in place? If it picks up one of those, the vacuum gets clogged and it just stops being able to function. Also does the same with any small pieces of plastic. If these things bother you, consider finding a more expensive robot."
4,REVIEW: Shark AI Ultra Voice Control Robot Vacuum,"Purchased the Shark AI Ultra Voice Control Robot Vacuum about 6-weeks ago and was immediately impressed:

1) Packaging, instructions, 100% EASE OF SET-UP, Wi-Fi, phone app, etc...miles ahead! Just a totally different and clearly BETTER process than my last (different brand) vacuum robot.

2) This vacuum is smart and very quick to learn your home...also VERY thorough in its cleaning patterns. This vacuum is VERY quiet when compared to our last robot vacuum (different brand)...it literally makes < 1/2 the noise of the prior one. This vacuum provides cleaning reports through the phone app with every finished cycle...you can see how long it ran and the entire footprint/area it cleaned (see pics).

3) THE BAGLESS COLLECTION TOWER IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN COLLECTION BAGS!!! We have 3-dogs and a cat, so no 60-day capacity here (not gonna lie); I've emptied it once already and it was about 1/2 way full when I did. I have my unit programmed to run on Mon/Wed/Fri (again, programming, set-up VERY easy). I probably could have gotten 45-days out the bagless collection tower/bin prior to emptying it. For a normal home that doesn't have as many pets as we do, 60+ days is an absolute yes on the collection bin/emptying.

4) The only minor concerns I have, which haven't presented any problems yet. Our home is 1,800 SF but the floor area Flo (my robot) cleans is only ~ 1,250 SF, and it takes her ~120 mins:
a) The dust collection tray in the vacuum itself is small, which causes it to return to the tower (and empty) while it's cleaning our home. NO problem as the unit picks-up right where it left-off.
b) The battery life doesn't allow the vacuum to complete a cycle before it needs to re-charge (once) while its cleaning our home. Again, NO problem as the unit picks-up right where it left-off after restoring its charge.

Due to a recent bad experience with a failed battery w/our last robot vacuum (didn't last 16-months), I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU PURCHASE THE 3-YEAR EXTENDED WARRANTY. It only costs $37 and will be well worth it if the battery on this unit does actually begin to fail prematurely like the last unit (different brand) I bought. To replace the battery on my old unit was going to cost me $110 + shipping. No way!! so I decided to just replace it."
4,"Great, but Broken After 8 Months","Initially the Shark Robot was ideal! It would map and clean designated areas with little interference. Cleaning out the filter and emptying the dust holder was simple. Suction power and clean up was phenomenal. 5 STARS!

However as several months passed, the Robot began to generate errors.

YouTube/Shark had awesome videos on the error codes to remedy. One code for drive wheel error kept shutting down the machine.

After talking to customer service the option was to return the entire machine and base and Shark would fix the drive wheel for free. I would just need to pay the $90.00 shipping fee to return it to me.

YouTube had various videos on this common problem and had an instructional on how to change the wheel at home. Finding the drive wheel was a challenge.

After contacting Shark and customer service, they indicated I should just purchase an entire new system and sent me a coupon for 10% off. I grumbled at the cost after the 10% and the next day received a coupon for 30% off…select items only.

Needless to say the 8 month old, very expensive Shark robot remains inactive. In reading other reviews this is a common issue. The electrical connection from the drive wheel to the wire was not connected all the way- when the robot making the Shark connected the port to the wheel several of the connector prongs were bent. Robot error in making another robot? For breakage after 8 months: STARS

I remain in search of a drive wheel for my Robot. Until then, I am disappointed that my Shark is not cleaning.

August 4, 2024. Found Right sided drive wheel for Shark. $89.00. It was difficult because they were either out of stock or not available. This makes me think there is an issue with the right drive wheel. Plenty of Left Drive Wheels are available. We noted that there were several prongs that were not like the NEW Drive wheel - so perhaps a defect in the Old Drive Wheel. The adapter connected perfectly to the NEW Wheel. Once we reattached the NEW RIGHT drive wheel, the Shark is back to normal. 4 STARS."
4,Strong,"Love this product for simple everyday cleaning. The schedule cleaning and mapping are great features. You can block certain rooms that you don’t want to clean. The machine is pretty strong where it will climb over the legs of a desk or push some things around. Wish this one would connect to our Alexa, but not a dealbreaker because we can use the shark app. The self cleaning is great. Noticed that the canister will pop out slightly when full which is a nice visual sign for us to empty. If you have dogs that shed a lot, the canister normally fills up in about three weeks. When the Robot empties into the canister, it is kind of loud. It sounds like when an airplane takes off. Another good feature is that there are “do not disturb” times you can set. If you have a bigger house and the battery dies, it will go back to the station to charge, then start vacuuming again. The “do not disturb” option helps with this so that it doesn’t go off at 2 AM to finish your house. I Enjoy this purchase!"
4,Good Vacuum,"I’m glad I got this on sale for half price because I like it but I wouldn’t have been happy paying full price for it. I’ve been using it for a couple of months and I can say that I like the relative low noise (all of these vacuums are loud but this one is tolerable), am a huge fan of the debris auto unload feature, and am happy overall with the general cleaning ability of this vacuum. It seems to do very well with daily sweeping of pet floof but if I wait more than 2 days to run it, the vacuum is less efficient. I recommend daily or every other day use for best results. Edge cleaning is non-existent, but I resolved that by taking a broom and whisking edge debris to the center of the room and the vacuum would grab it from there. The vacuum is a really nice supplement to having to physically vacuum my home, and because I have pets and I appreciate having it. I don’t have any thick carpets and my home is vinyl and tile flooring. This vacuum has done very well with low throw rugs and under beds. It also does NOT bang itself against items or walls and if you’ve have a Roomba, you know what I’m talking about. Ha ha! Love the app and I use it most of the time to remotely initiate cleaning but it’s nice to be able to walk by the vacuum and push the “clean” button, too. Super-fast charging, as charging a vacuum goes."
4,A lot of tech for the $. Does a good job. UPDATE AFTER A 1.5 YEARS AT WORK,"I got this vac 3 days ago. Ran it a 2 x each day. My initial impressions are positive. I have read good and bad reviews here and my experience is pretty positive.
It works as advertised. It mapped out my house crudely and I selected the rooms. The app works well. There still needs to be several improvements to the scheduling to make it more effective.
IMO once your house is mapped sending it to a room seems to work better than an entire house vacuum especially if you have a house over 2000 sq ft. It would be great to schedule a room to be cleaned at a certain time on a certain day. Some rooms get more use than others that don’t need to be cleaned. You can’t do that yet.

How do you update software and firmware? One would think that new versions are coming out all the time.

The navigation is good but there is room for meaningful improvements too. It bumps into a lot of things to find its location.

I think the map should always get better but it seems once you save it doesn’t improve it any more.

Would like more flexibility with the map and rooms in the app. Ie zoom and nonrectangular rooms.

It doesn’t get stuck often but it has. It closed the door I. The bathroom and could not get out. It got stuck between a nightstand and a wall that was the same width as the vacuum. Both were easily fixed.

I have a outdoor room that has one step. It would be nice if you have a way to have a second map for other floors.

All that said, you get a lot of tech for the $ and it is pretty cool. There must be millions of lines of code in this thing, the logic is unreal.

This is my first robot vac. I never bought one because they seemed more of a hassle than convenience but I think now they are an over that hurdle with the self-empty and improvements in navigation battery etc.

It cleans pretty well. And is not loud. Someone else said he was loud.... compared to an upright it is nearly Silent. When it self docks it is louder for about 30 seconds while it empties.

I’ll revisit it in a few weeks when I have more cycles on it but I am satisfied so far.

UPDATE: Wow, its been almost 21 months since I purchased this item and I have to say it has become a member of the family now almost like a pet. It does its thing and does its will. Yeah, it has gotten stuck a few times on a sliding door track and locked itself in the bathroom but it sends me a message on my phone.

It has updated its software on its own a few times since I've owned it . I really like that feature. After each update, the maps are messed up but they seem to fix themselves in a few days on its own and it is more accurate each time.
I have replaced some of the worn parts, (widely available online) and it is an easy fix.

There are a few features I wish they would develop. I would like to schedule it to go to specific rooms on specific days. I find for larger homes it is better to tackle a room or two each day while you are away. I've had it do the whole house a number of times and it takes a long time because it has to go back and recharge itself a couple of times and it restarts on its own, usually at an inconvenient time.

The bottom line I still love it and would buy it again. When this one stops working I will get another shark. I stayed at a friend's home who had a top to line romba robot vac and it was no better than what the shark does. It may have had a few more features (no go, etc) but I bet in an update you will see those features in your shark.
Still sticking with 4 stars. As I think they could do a few things a little bit better."
4,"The vacuum is very good, the app is ok","6/10/2020 update:
I deleted the old map and let the Shark IQ recreate. This time the map was more accurate. so if your map doesn't look right, just delete and start over.

6/3/2020:
My expectations were mixed after watching several review videos. So let me address some common points:
1). Noise - I can't say how this compares with other robots, but even on ""Max"" setting it is much quieter than my stand up vacuum. If it's on ""Eco"" or ""Normal"" it's even quieter. I find the default setting of ""Normal"" does well for my home (all hardwood floors with area rugs). Although you can certainly tell the robot is vacuuming, I can comfortably work or watch tv while the robot cleans. In fact, the noise from bumping onto things is louder than the suction noise.
2). Surfaces - my house is all hardwood floors with area rugs. I have padded kitchen mats and the robot has no problem climbing up these pads to clean them... or even half way on and halfway off. One rug is a shag rug (raised slightly higher with padding underneath)... the robot has some difficultly getting on top of the rug, but once it's there it manages to vacuum across it without getting stuck. I'm actually really impressed with this, because this is a very fluffy shag carpet that is quite difficult to vacuum even with a stand up vacuum. I don't expect the Shark to deep clean this shag run, I'll need to do that occasionally myself. Just the fact that it doesn't get stuck on this carpet and need my assistance is good enough for me.. the fact that it actually manages to surface clean the shag run is a nice bonus! The Shark will go over wires and power cords with some difficulty, but it's best to tuck that stuff away. I put mine behind the included ""Bot Barrier"" to avoid any loose ends from being sucked into the robot.
3). Cleaning and Emptying Itself - It does a really good job here. I auto schedule it to clean daily and the floors are very clean. The Shark returns to it's base and empties itself without any intervention on my part. I saw one review online that dumped a ton of junk on the floor and then complained the robot didn't detect it needed to empty it's bin. I haven't seen this problem, but I also don't pour trash all over my floors. So I don't know if there is a sensor or just a timer, but I haven't had any issues. The one issue that has come up is very long hair. My wife has hair down to her mid back, because the hairs are so long they do get wrapped around the vacuum brush. When this gets to be too much, the Shark will stop and give an error message. I had to remove the brush and cut out the hair with some scissors. This only really happened the first couple of times as the robot was picking up hair under hard to reach places (like under beds and near baseboards). With a daily cleaning schedule, it's not a major issue.. maybe once a week or two I'll need to clean out the wrapped hair. There is a self-cleaning comb inside the robot... I expect that would work better with short hair like pet hair. Compared to the convenience of having a robot floor vac... this is no big deal at all.
4). App - This is why I only give 4 stars and hopefully it will improve over time. The basic commands of the app work perfectly fine. I can schedule, star cleaning, return to dock, change vaccum strength (Eco, Normal, Max) and view battery strength and error messages. And it can be connected with Alexa for voice command. No problem with any of that. Many people complain about generating maps... Mine was generated after a week of cleaning. Be patient, let it complete the map itself. The problem with the app is that once the map is created, the walls are not shown, so you have no idea where one room starts and the other ends. You have to put your own room labels but without walls there really is no guide. Once you create rooms in your map, the app lets you choose which rooms you want cleaned... but so far I've found that the robot is confused possibly because my room boundaries are incorrect. The workaround here is easy... just let the robot clean everywhere. I may actually delete my map, as it seems the room boundaries may be confusing the robot more than helping it. If Shark improves this portion of the app or I find a better workaround, I would change the review to 5 stars. For the price and performance it's not a big deal."
4,This is a game changer in a multiple pet household,"UPDATE 1: In my original review, I complained that you couldn’t see a map of where the vacuum actually went while cleaning. I figured out how to find this feature in the app. When you click on “History” a calendar pops up with all the days the vacuum cleaned highlighted. Click on one of those days and you will get a detailed report with a map coloring in the parts of your house the vacuum cleaned (see attached photo). I am still keeping it at 4 stars because it will not pick up some objects like coins and legos. Otherwise, we are very happy with it.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is my first robot vacuum so I can’t really compare it against other models. We have had it for a few weeks now so I feel like I can give a proper review. I will update if my feelings change. We had been skeptical of robot vacuums for years but I wish we didn’t wait so long. This has been a game changer! Our house has multiple pets (dogs, cat, cockatiels) and we live in the country. To keep the floor clean, I needed to sweep at least once a day if not more. I also have a lot of furniture (obstacles) in relatively small rooms so I was concerned a robot vacuum would get lost, confused, or just not do a very good job. So far, this vacuum has gone above and beyond my expectations.

Let’s start with the cleaning power. We have low carpets, laminate flooring, and stone tile. The robot does a great job cleaning all floor types. We had an Oreck vacuum for the carpet and I think the shark does a better job picking up the pet hair and dust. There is also some minor elevation changes throughout the house (0.5-1 inch high in some entryways) and the robot actually climbs over these areas really well.

The app and the map: The app is relatively easy to use but I wish it would show you where the robot had actually been while cleaning on the map. The mapping is pretty accurate but I didn’t get it right until the second try. For our first mapping run, I thought it would be best to keep all things on the floor that would normally be there so the robot would be better at negotiating around things. This made a very confusing map and the robot had a hard time properly identifying rooms. You can name rooms during map editing but it is easier to do that if the borders actually make sense. Second round, I took all small/medium things (pet bowls, trash cans, etc) off the floor. Only furniture and large appliances were left on the floor. This was a much better map and even though there are usually these smaller things on the floor, the robot does a really good job tightly negotiating obstacles. Having said that, make sure you place the base in an open area because if anything gets in its way directly around the base, it will get confused and start circling things like table legs or get stuck in a loop somewhere near the base but never make it to the base. It tells you exactly how much open space around the base you need so take that seriously.

The self emptying base is awesome. In the first few runs, we had to rescue the robot from cords and larger things like marbles and legos that sometimes got stuck but now that it is on a daily schedule and we moved all cords, there haven’t been any issues. Maintenance is really easy and intuitive on this machine. I just wish it could suck up larger things like legos and coins.

Overall, I definitely think it was worth what we paid. My only complaints are that I wish the app showed the path of the robot on the map and that it could pick up larger things without those things getting stuck. Other than that, we are all very happy with it."
4,Struggles with thick dog hair,"I love the robot vacuum. I like that I can schedule it to run, and I don’t have to think about it. I haven’t had it get caught on any cords or wires. The first time the spinner brush got dog hair in it, it took me a few days to figure out the colored ends come off too and hair will get stuck in there. I also have long hair so that can get tangled.

My complaint is that it gets clogged easily. I have a Labrador so lots of course dog hair. The dog hair will collect and clog at the entrance to the bin on the vacuum (the space between the roller brush and where the dirt is stored while the vacuum runs). It will get so compacted in there that it can’t empty into the trash bin. That does get annoying.

Another issue I have is it seems to lose suction when it transitions from hard wood to the area rug, especially on the corners of the rug. I always seem to find wads of dog hair near the corners of the rugs. So I end up doing a spot clean around the corners after it does a vacuum of the room.

Overall, I really like it. I like that I can control it from my phone, and it always seems to be quicker than the predicted time on the app, which is a good thing. I would buy it again but not sure I would get it if I had more than one hairy dog."
4,OK so far,"I have been tempted to buy a robot vacuum for several years and finally pulled the trigger.

The Good
- Easy set-up. App is intuitive.
- Easy to empty the robot and stand vacuum compartments.
- We primarily have hardwood floors. Floors receive traffic from a couple pets and kids. The areas of the floors the robot can access appear to receive a better cleaning then being swept by hand.
- Robot does a decent job navigating and doesn't appear to be missing any large areas.
- Robot cleans under beds and couches, areas that are difficult to sweep manually.

The Bad
- There's a chair the robot get stuck under. The chair legs are just wide enough for the robot to squeeze through but sometimes the robot can't find it's way out. Maybe just need to block these chair legs before activating in the future.
- The robot vacuum compartment has already been clogged. However, areas underneath the beds were very dirty. With some more regular cleaning in these areas I'm hoping clogging ceases to be an issue.
- When sending the robot to a couple bedrooms it tries to take a weird path instead of heading down the hallway. Eventually, the vacuum finds its way, but the vacuum doesn't seem to be using the house map appropriately.

Overall, I'm satisfied and think this vacuum might save me a couple hours of sweeping every week. There's still some manual sweeping and vacuuming for the baseboards, floor seams, and other areas the vacuum can't access but that's to be expected. If the robot lasts at least a couple years I will have gotten my money's worth."
4,Works well,I've had this vacuum for quite a while now. Seems to work very well other than I still can not get it to connect to my Android phone. I have spoke with their customer service department and it wasn't very helpful. So I just hit the start button before I leave
4,great features,"schedules are nice. room mapping and priority is nice.

we have medium length pet hair that jams up certain parts of this machine and its a little tedious to need to use a screwdriver to take apart the already removable parts to this rig to fully clean it.

got this on sale for over 50% off"
4,Overall it's OK,"This is a feedback after using one week. Overall, I would give 4.5 out of 5. It cleans 90%-95% of my first floor including carpet family room.
Pros:
I have two cats, so I did test the carpet family room with my regular vacuum after its cleaning work. It does pick up majority of cat hair, just a little missed. I am OK with that.
The noise is OK when it's cleaning floors. I have an old iRobot purchased years ago, and its noise is much louder compared to Shark.
The mapping is pretty accurate. I am very impressed!
It's surprisingly intelligent. It states self-emptying base holds up to 60 days of dirt and debris, I didn't think about to check dirt box on the 4th day after I used it. When I gave the order to clean the rooms, it told me I need to empty my dirt box first! So if you have any pet like I do (2 cats), you may need to be ready to empty that box less than one week!

Cons:
Inside the box, there are only two sheets. One is to show you how to set up, the other is related to the APP. It doesn't have any handbook to introduce the product's parts, which is what I am looking for. I don't want to damage my new cleaning toy. I would feel more comfortable, i.e. empty the dirt box, trying to take the filters off with the direction of handbook.
So far, I only did mapping for my first floor. I don't know if I can add another mapping for my second floor."
4,"funciona OK, la aplicación aún no disponible en Play Store para Argentina,","baje la aplicacion APKPure, pero seria mas sencillo si ponen SHARCLEAN APP disponible en Play Store,...funciona perfecto"
4,"Very, very good, very bad.","I got Rosie when she was on sale. We set her to charge, and I was busy and didn't get her started for a week or so. Then one day we heard a strange noise and found Rosie eagerly working away on her own! We watched in amazement as she learned the house all by herself, as we don't care to use Alexa. We sort of learned each other over a few weeks and I LOVED how the house looked. If there was a problem we figured it out and cleaned her when needed. But then came the day when she started out and then stopped after 2 or 3 feet, whining about her side brush being stuck. We have taken it off, cleaned it and just done everything we can think of but she still claims it is stuck. My house looks terrible and I feel that is no behavior for such an expensive item to indulge in! I found one video that advised ""tweaking"" the side brush, but that didn't work. Has anyone else had this experience?"
4,"Shark, ""there's dirt in the water with this beast""","I have owned Roomba e3, Roomba e5, a Shark IQ and now the Shark AI robot vac. All worked well, but each had it's small quirks. The early Roombas required constant bin emptying, especially with multiple pets. The Sharks have one beater brush which was an initial concern, but oddly it did well with just one.

The noise of the Shark AI is about on par with the Roomba but more noisey than the Shark IQ. A rat-a-tat from the brush on the Shark AI that was absent in the other Shark. Some of the little things make me think both these units are OEM from different suppliers despite their similarities (different filters, brush beater, slight variations in bin air flow).

No privacy camera issues with it's Lidar mapping, it doesn't bump as often as the others and steers clear of obstacles. The map produced by the Shark AI is more accurate than the Shark IQ which failed to identify some rooms correctly and required multiple mapping scouting runs to get it right (Shark AI took just one pass to map correctlywith it's LIDAR mapping).

The Shark AI has a spot clean option but it appears to be only a fixed size (OK, it's spot not area). You can set variable size Rooms to clean with both Shark models. One of the Roombas offered mapping but like the Shark IQ didn't always make an accurate map which is key to cleaning a specific room (assuming it's accurately mapped).

The self empty is a big plus for me after chasing the Roombas to empty after every pass. All these robot vacs pack the dirt into their dust containers (you will be surprised how much they find). Since it's a blade like roller and not a brush it's better on hard floors although does quite well on others.

Did I mention that I have Pets. Dirt, Fleas, Loose Fur they are all captured by all the robot vacs and are central to controlling them with daily or twice daily cleanings. Best way to control this issue with little effort.

The Sharks run a pass and return to empty after about 30-40 minutes in use but they don't appear to judge bin fullness (the Roomba would notify full based on airflow reduction in my opinion). Both Sharks then go back out to finish where they left off. One of the Roombas did similar but the Shark AI was more accurate finding the same spot.

The Shark AI did a better job with rugs on a flat floor where all the Roombas attempted to push the rugs or hang on their corners. The Shark IQ was marginally better having to be unstuck less often but it was not an issue with the Shark AI which was able to navigate on and off the rugs and clean them.

If when I change the beater brush if it makes a difference in the noisey rat-a-tat then I'll raise the stars but for now it's a lower mark for that item, but not the cleaning capabilities."
4,"Great Vacuum, Horrible app","My headline says it all, but here is the breakdown.
The Good:
Cleans the carpet quickly
Works quietly
Doesn't bump into stuff
Easy to use without the app

The Bad:
The app would not let me enter my wi-fi password
The only feature I need from the app should not require a wi-fi password if the app can already talk to the vacuum

The Ugly:
It seems to have a hard time returning to the dock, taking multiple attempts at speeds I don't otherwise see as it is vacuuming and always just off to one side"
4,Decent vacuum,"The programming and the sensors of these vacuums continues to get better and better. My biggest complaint is the volume level of the on-board speaker. Even with the volume at 100% in the app you still can't hear it unless you are standing right next to it. That means when it gets stuck somewhere it ends up being a room-by-room search looking under beds, etc. to rescue it. Previous versions of the Shark robot vacuums did not have this issue. When I use the app to have the robot play a location sound you could hear it and at least head in the right direction."
4,Excellent Even Outdoors but Need to Improve the App,"I know I'm not supposed to, but I use the Shark AI Ultra outdoors and it works great for cleaning the deck around the pool, in a lanai. I dock it in a sheltered area. The hardest thing was getting it to initially map the space correctly since it doesn't recognize the lanai screen as the end of the outdoor space. My video shows how it successfully navigates around the pool (except when it doesn't--aaugh!) and then what I did to help it create a map. I had to use a large roll of construction paper to create a temporary wall. There is more advice for using a robot vacuum outdoors in separate social media videos.

The app needs more capability, especially to be able to schedule rooms for cleaning. Even though I use it outdoors, I defined my space into separate rooms. I use the outdoor kitchen and eating area a lot so I would love to schedule regular cleaning. Other parts of the outdoor space are not used often so I would not need to schedule cleaning so often. Since it doesn't hold enough charge to clean the entire space in one run, and it is not smart enough to pick up where it left off when it runs out of power and recharges (or I'm not smart enough to figure out how to make it do it), I cannot use the scheduling feature, which only allows scheduling the whole space. Ideally, and maybe sometime in the far away future, it would be great to integrate the app with weather forecasts so that it doesn't run in inclement weather. But first, let's get more people using it on their outdoor patios and decks.

Using a vacuum outdoors is fabulous. We previously used a leaf blower which puts too much stuff in the pool. A water hose is wasteful and you just have a wet deck after you're done. Before the robot, we cleaned the deck about once a week or every 10 days or so. Now we run clean it with the robot almost every day (weather permitting) since we're outside almost every day. The feel of vacuumed pavers under your feet is simply the best. Not to mention the reduction of dirt that previously was tracked into the house. Oh yes, I don't have to do anything except the monthly maintenance!"
4,"Generally works quite well, but issues with side brushes and the app","First, this review is for Model AV2511AE (60-day). Many of the reviews here, especially the older ones, are for different models. I didn’t have any trouble mapping my home (it only does the first floor). It works very well as far as the actual vacuuming (suction levels, picking up human and dog hair, battery time) for hard floors, some multi-level throw rugs/runners, and the short pile carpet. I have a throw rug in one room that is deeper pile and although it seems to have enough suction to clean it well (on max), every single time I let it vaccum that rug, one of the side brushes gets completely stuck in it when the unit turns itself and I have to “free” it. After only three runs, one of the brushes is almost completely destroyed (and four replacement brushes costs $20 PLUS $10 shipping from Shark!) so I will either need to change my map to exclude that part of the family room (and will have to sweep it manually) or will have to spend a hundred dollars a year on additional brushes!

The vaccum has one quirk: the path it takes to do the whole house isn’t always the same and it doesn’t seem to be the most straightforward way to cover all the areas (but it DOES eventually do all of it).

The app has some quirks. In the History, for example, although it correctly reports where it has cleaned (including the path from the base to the specific room if you only ask it to do one area), when it reports “Cleaning Runs”, it is counting the number of “rooms” cleaned, including counting any area it has to go through in order to do a specific room. (I have only done two runs of the whole main level of my home (3 “rooms”: living room, hallway, and family room), but asked it to do just the hallway once and just the family room twice, but because it goes *through* the hallway to get to the family room (and just vacuums the single path in the hall), it counts the hallway in the number of areas it counts… so just vacuuming my family room is two “cleanings”).

You CANNOT tell it to clean just one room using the app (and you cannot schedule cleaning just one room)."
4,Check your Shark robot’s model number upon receipt!,"While I do like this Shark Robot, it isn’t what I ordered. It superficially looks the same as the one pictured in Amazon’s listing, but at least one feature is different (one side brush, not two); and, there may be other differences that I have not discovered. The model number for my robot is not RV2001AE, but another model that is not listed in Shark’s current catalog. Otherwise, it works fine, and the self-empty feature is handy. For you prospective buyers, bear in mind that the “self-cleaning” brush roll is that IF there isn’t a lot of human and/or pet hair on your floors and carpets — you WILL need manually clean the brush from time to time. (Fortunately, Shark has designed the brush for easy, tool-less removal.). Also, before first use, thoroughly vacuum all floors and carpets manually. The Sharp app is OK, but its mapping is somewhat crude (but works). Suction is good, battery life acceptable, the self docking-and-recharge feature is important and useful. Finally, this model Sharp Robot is surprisingly quiet (I cannot tell any difference, noise-wise, berween “eco” and “normal” mode, although battery life is noticeably longer in “eco”). Overall, a good starter smart robot vac."
4,Voice Control?,"Handy little robot vacuum at a very good price. Tried to set it up on Alexa but … it asks for the robots name. Over and over. After ten tries Alexa gives up.
So not unhappy with the Shark … more that they say it’s voice controlled. I’m sure it’s something I missed, but it’s not obvious. There’s no printed instruction and the videos aren’t helping."
4,"Great product, software needs tweaking!","I’ve been running this Shark vacuum for several days now, and it’s a huge help in keeping the 2000-sf mixed carpet and tile house clean in between my vacuum sessions. With a bunch of long-haired dogs in and out of the house, the Shark vacuum makes it easier to keep up with the hair. It’s also pretty quiet - the loudest noise it makes is when it rolls over the seams of the tiled floors. I do like the ability to have it clean individual rooms as needed on top of the routinely scheduled cleanings.

The down sides are: 1) The dock’s reservoir needs to be emptied after 3-4 house cleanings. The dog hair does fill up the reservoir in a hurry, but it’s still a long ways short of the claimed 60 sessions. 2) On tiled floors, the long-whiskered brushes at the front corners will occasionally flick bits of debris back past the roller brush, leaving the bits behind. 3). Twice now I’ve had to rescue the Shark vacuum where it stopped on a narrow strip of hardwood floor between an area rug and a step down into another room. Moving the rug further away from the step solved this issue. 4) The biggest issue I found was with the downloaded app; the scheduler only allows whole-house cleanings. That is, the app does not offer an option to clean several rooms every other day, such as the bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen M-W-F and the hallway, office, and utility room T-Th-Sa. It’s either all or nothing. In my house, this causes the Shark vacuum to have to stop partway through a house cleaning to go back and take several hours to charge up its battery before resuming, with the result that the house cleaning can take half the day or more. This software issue is mainly why I dinged the Shark vacuum a star; if the makers can provide a software update where I can schedule individual rooms each week, then I’d give the vacuum 5 stars."
4,3rd time’s a charm,"We are on our second one and this one isn’t working correctly either. They don’t last even a month before having issues.

**Update**
I’m updating my review based on the excellent customer service from Amazon and they’re sending me another replacement to try. Hopefully 3rd time’s a charm! I bought one for my mom and she’s had no issues. I love ours when it works but the first 2 have had issues. Will update again after we get the new replacement."
4,Easy and efficient,I love that this cleans so easily. It does not do well on detecting stairs though. So be sure to use the avoid zones.
4,"Quick, easy, does the job","The app makes everything easy. We use it every other day because of the pets. It sucks everything up, which is great, our pets shed. It's small enough to fit into tight spaces and it has that rotating way of moving which makes it easy for her to navigate. Definitely enjoy the purchase, helps out a lot"
4,SHARK ROBOT VACUUM,"Play Video
Exceptional cleaning! I am such a fan! I run the vacuum daily and feel that our home is much cleaner. It works equally well on hardwood floors as it does on carpets. It gets in close to the trim board and entryways.
However, it is quite noisy, but that is my only complaint about the vacuum. As much as I am a fan of the vacuum I'm not a fan of the app to run it. It is hard to use and difficult to find the needed info. I am very happy with this purchase."
4,Far better alternative to Roomba,"I bought this during a Black Friday deal, so the price was great. I've had a couple Roombas over the years and have always either returned them or been greatly underwhelmed. I've been using the Shark for a few weeks now, and it has always actually done its job, cleaned the specified areas, and returned to the dock for charging. My Roomba would get stuck somewhere at least half the time, or sometimes just ""run out of battery"" and die in the middle of the room. The Shark seems reliable and cleans great. The app is also great and seems well-written, provides a great user experience, and is fast to load.

The ""Mapping"" feature is also amazing! It took about 20 minutes to create an accurate map of my downstairs, and I was able to easily label the rooms. I was quite impressed with this feature. Note, it's not gonna look like a map an architecture would come up with; think of it more like sonar you'd see on a submarine. However, it's perfectly usable for defining rooms and off-limit zones.

Now a few cons:

The Shark would get 5 stars, except for a few minor problems. First, it does seem to clean sometimes when you don't want it to, such as at 4am. It's not quiet, especially when it sings or when it empties itself at the dock, so it's woke me up a couple times. The app has the ability to ""set a schedule"" (which I haven't done yet) but doesn't have the ability to have ""no schedule"". Luckily, this hasn't happened a lot yet and I've just opened the app and told it to return to the dock.

Second, Alexa integration isn't supported with this model even though the product description says otherwise. I was hoping I could command the Shark to start cleaning using Alexa, but unfortunately I have to use the app which isn't too hard. If Alexa integration is important to you, I'd suggest looking at other brands.

If they fixed both these things, I would happily give the Shark a 5 star review."
4,Great Vacuum but communication with the app is lacking,"First off, I'd like to state that this is my first purchase where I bought something that was technically used from the amazon warehouse instead of just brand new and so far it's been fantastic and the product was over $200 off MSRP. I received the vacuum with all the original tape etc. still on it nothing had been used, the only thing missing was the original box packaging (as noted in item description of the one I purchased) and the user manual which was ok since user manuals can be found online these days. So I'd suggest viewing the used options before buying new.

I was able to put the vacuum together without the user manual and download the app and get it connected without the user manual. However, the vacuum and app seem to have issues communicating with one another and I know it's not my wifi as my husband who is a programmer and very tech savvy has checked our connections and they are fantastic. When I first connected the app to the vacuum it wouldn't allow me to do the explore run. It prompted me to do one but then wouldn't allow me to hit the explore run button the app as it was grayed out. I had to do my own troubleshooting as none of the support articles discussed this issue. I ended up deleting the robot from the app and reseting the vacuum's factory settings even though I'd never used it. Resetting factory settings worked and I was able to do an explore run but the first explore run the map was pretty wonky so I had to do a second explore run.

Also since then whenever I go into the app to ask the vacuum to clean it takes forever for the app to communicate with the vacuum sometimes up to 10 minutes and often when I look in the app it says disconnected but when I look on the base and the vacuum it shows that it is connected to wifi. If I press clean on the vacuum though it will do a full house clean it of course doesn't let me choose rooms, spot clean, or do matrix clean that seems to only be able to be done from the app. It seems mainly to be an app issue so that's why I give it 4 stars not 5 but the vacuum itself I'd give a 5."
4,"Stopped working after 6 months, still waiting on replacement","My first robot vacuum. Does the job, may get stuck on small bumps, stopped working due to software or sensor issue. Customer service said they will send a replacement. It arrived after about 2 weeks. It remains to see if it's working"
4,4 stars,"This is my first robot vac and I’m very pleased with it! I purchased because I live on a ranch and have a border collie and Aussie and dirty shoes that come thru the house! This vac would have received 5 starts if the hair didn’t get caught in the end of the roller of the brush!
Hair doesn’t get caught in the brush, just the end of the roller!
I bought this particular Back because it said Hair did not get caught in the brush!
So I’m very please with the vac, and I would recommend!"
4,Great suction for pet hair but…,"This is my third robot, vacuum cleaner, and by far the best one in terms of powerful suction and its ability to get pet hair and dust. There are several filters to clean and it really doesn’t amazing job. My complaint is controlling this product with the app. It doesn’t work properly. If you can live with that buy it."
4,Placement of Docking/Charging Station,"I had to return this Shark vacuum without ever using it. I opened the box and read the instructions, which said to place the docking/charging station on a hard surface. I have both hardwood floors and carpeted floors, but the best place for my docking station would be in a carpeted room. I called the Customer Service number in the instruction booklet and told him my situation. He said if it is on carpet the robot may not be able to dock properly and therefore would not charge properly. How I wish this had been clear in the online description before I bought it!
My brother has this same vacuum and absolutely loves it. His docking station is on a hard surface so he didn't have my issue.
Hopefully this will help someone else when considering this purchase."
4,"Vac is great, software hopefully better with updates","I have a small but very clean apartment. I've run the vac 3 times in a week to test mapping and to complete a couple cleanings. I'm surprised at the amount of dust etc this unit finds on my clean floors. I have bad allergies to pollen and dust, trees, grass, weeds; this is doing a good job keeping that in check. It's quieter than I was led to believe. ONLY FOUR STARS BECAUSE: The app leaves much to be desired. I've had to remap once already and will need to do it again. Biggest issue I have is creating ""no go"" zones - they seem to be set with a minimum size that is far too big for the spots I'm marking off. I have to give up a couple feet when I only need to mark one foot. The Lidar comes up with some mangy looking maps, too. Second try, I had to look at the space marked off to make sense of the orientation of the room compared to the mapping. Working on keeping it from climbing into low-lying things - it's like having a toddler or an untrained puppy, climbing into my entertainment center and some low lying storage spots. I ""hid"" a couple areas that it ignored during mapping but it went ""there"" anyway during cleaning. The app, fortunately, is something I expect will get better with software upgrades."
4,Brush really not self cleaning,"I have noticed the quality of all the robotic vacuums has declined over the years. I had to replace my Neato brand and since they had gone out of business I decided to try the Shark brand. I wasn’t thrilled about the self emptying features since the unit takes up more space but I wanted a vacuum with mapping capability so I chose the Shark. It takes longer to run compared to my previous models but does a decent job cleaning. I noticed it will not cross over metal thresholds even if they are flush to the floor which means it won’t enter some of my rooms. I don’t find it e trembly noisy but usually run it when I am not around.
I guess the one issue I have with it is the “self cleaning” brush roll. As shown in the pictures this is not the case in my household. I do have long hair but I didn’t have this much of an issue with my previous units. Otherwise it is a decent vacuum for the money"
4,Good quality clean,Very easy to set up and get running! It has 3 cleaning speeds. It does a great job getting rid of surface dirt. It completed our job without having to charge. The versatility between hard floor and carpet was good. I found it a bit noisy running but my adult son said it was quiet. Did not avoid pet pooh though.
4,Works great,"This works better than our previous robotic vacuum, by a major competitor. It has an accompanying phone app with which you can program it to clean at specific times and days of the week. With the app, it maps out your entire house (one level only), then with the app, you can name rooms on the floor plan. This enables you to use the app to only clean a specific room, or even target a specific area of a room outside of the normal cleaning schedule. There are three downsides I have found. The setup of mapping and creating rooms for the whole house is time consuming, though not particularly difficult once you visually orient what you’re seeing on the floor plan it shows you it’s mapped out. Then, the orange release button on the dust cup is sensitive. In removing it to empty it, be very careful not to bump it before you get to the garage. However, I do love that it goes to its dock, suctions the vacuum’s internal dust and hair contents into the larger upper cup, and then resumes cleaning. It will also go home to recharge and resume cleaning once charged. There is plenty of charge on this, though. And the last downside I’ve found is that you can have only one phone paired to the vacuum. So, I can use the app to run it, but my husband can’t. He has to walk over to the vacuum and push the button. I know, minor inconvenience. But this means that if he makes a mess in only one room, he has to get the machine, take it into that room and push the button. It then will attempt to clean the whole house. I would definitely recommend, and would buy again."
4,My wife is happy.,It does a decent job with the one brush sweeper but definitely didn't pick everything up. We got some of the three brush sweepers and it does an excellent job. They should just start off with the three brush sweepers rather than spending more money when you spend so much on the vacuum to begin with.
4,Doesn't get jammed with pet hair.,Does well on hard floors. Only surface cleans carpets. Doesn't have the suction or brushes to get pet hair out of carpets.
4,Best one I've had so far,"I used to have robots from ilife. the v3 and v9. Both were meh. constantly getting stuck on things and the latter just up and completely dies. I got this one for a number of reasons.
1) filters are replaceable. You would not believe how many bots (including some of the shark ones) want you to replace the entire dust bin..at >$20 per to replace the dust filter.
2) Mapping
So far, I am quite pleased. I like:
1) It doesn't get caught on things It seems to be smart enough to not get stuck on everything like other bots did.
2) It cleans pretty good. It gets tons of pet hair and dust. Has made a noticeable difference in the house.
3) Bin. I was dubious but that self cleaning is great. I would never let it go 30-60 days like they claim but it is definitely nice to have.
4) App is decent. Why can't companies figure out multiple runs per day? Or just to charge and keep going forever during waking hours?
Things I don't like:
1) It does NOT get everything. For example, the LIDAR thing on top keeps it from getting under islands, coffee tables etc. Other bots will go under those.
2) the LIDAR gave me error messages...I'm on high alert for a major failure on this thing but we'll see.

Will update after more than 30 days."
4,So glad I finally bought this!,"I have been wanting a robotic vacuum for years and never gave in. Finally this was on sale during amazing prime days and I bought it for half off! The performance is great, the round size still gets into corners around the corner somehow, it goes over the area thoroughly. Only reason for 4 starts is they it’s a bit loud and moves too slowly (cleans 1200 sq fr home in 2 hours)."
4,Item would not connect to the internet which is essential for use.,The company said that Amazon will refund the disputed restocking fee. I didn’t get to use the product because there was a problem with my connection. Amazon and the seller worked with me to correct the issue.
4,Battery takes a while to charge,"I have a 1500 square-foot home and this machine can vacuum it without a problem, with about 60% battery life after it’s done.

The battery does take a while to recharge though, which may be a good thing in the long run—trickle charge to prolong the battery life.

Be sure to pick up everything off of the floor for the initial exploration, the robot will adapt to new items on the floor after that—things under an inch might still just get ran over."
4,Great little bot vac,"This little bot works great, cleans very well on tile, it's an ok carpet vacuum. My tile is very clean after using this but carpet it's ok and does not work on shag/high pile carpet. As you can see on the picture it doesn't like my little rug, it will avoid it if it can and when it doesn't it looks like a little lost child in the woods roaming around blind. Then afterwards it will tell me that something is stuck in the roller, I've found it stuck once in the middle of the rug but nothing stuck in the roller 😂🤣. Other than that I've had no problems with it and it's been working ever since I bought it."
4,"If it needs warranty, you'll get a substandard replacement","""Larry"" worked great for 6 months. Then one day randomly reported an obstruction. One of the side brushes was rotating slower than the other. After talking to tech support, they started a replacement of just the robot. After 2 weeks, we contacted then and they ""determined"" that they didn't have this model anymore and that we would now get a complete replacement (base and robot.)

The replacement is a newer model with only 1 side brush, that does not extend beyond the side of the robot. Additionally, it is horribly loud. After searching the interwebs, various ""fixes"" such as random bits of tape were tried and we gave up. The replacement - sucks. Except not in the preferred manner. Suction on this unit is less than the previous. It struggles to suck up tiny pieces of litter."
4,Staying,"We bought this robot vac after our Neato vac’s battery needed to be replaced and we learned the company went out of business.
This vac navigates better, the set up was easier, and I like the feature that lets you name rooms so you can direct it to clean only certain rooms. The self-emptying feature is also a plus.
Our house is around 2600 sq. ft and to do the whole house takes a lengthy recharge in the middle of cleaning. It does a good job of getting out of tight spots and is quieter than I expected. However, I don’t believe it cleans as well as our old Neato, especially on our rugs. But since we only have a couple of rugs and no carpeting, I can live with that."
4,Worth it but not perfect,"So I've had this a little while now and have it on a schedule every day to clean 80% of my house. It navigates the house just without incident most days. Sometimes it'll get close to a stair and decide its a cliff, hasn't happened enough that its not still funny when it does. If you have a heavy shedding dog - just don't bother. Accept that your floors will never be clean and enjoy the journey. The vacuum itself is quite capable, I have it transitioning from laminate to carpet to stone to heavily textured mats and it handles them all just fine. The vacuums suction level on normal is quiet and more than adequate to get the job done. The notion that this bin will last 60 days between emptying is laughable. I live alone with no pets currently and it lasts about 2 weeks max. This vacuum is finding dog hair in this carpet from animals the previous owners had. its kinda crazy sometimes just how much it finds. Barring catastrophic failure in the near future I'd say its worth the money. I think pet hair would destroy it though, any heavy shedding critter is either going to burn it out or cause the brush to jam up so often its not even worth running it."
4,"Great for wood/laminate flooring, not so great on carpet","UPDATE 1/28/24: I perform routine maintenance, and while it still does a pretty decent job with getting the loose hair on our bare floors, it does a pretty poor job getting hair from our low-pile area rugs. I do still have to go over the area rugs with a conventional vacuum, and I have noticed this is a change since we first purchased it. I can go behind it with another vacuum and it's like it didn't get anything off the area rug at all. Overall, still incredibly happy with it for our purposes (maintenance between vacuuming) but am a little disappointed to see it isn't performing as well as it had on our area rug.

ORIGINAL 5/5/23: We have 2 medium sizes dogs and 3 cats... who all shed. A lot. We will have dustbunnies in a matter of hours. This is fabulous for staying on top of it but does not replace the need to still manually vacuum our low pile area rug.

I have only needed to empty the container twice in the 2.5 months since owning it (and the first time was just for curiosity, it wasn't close to being full).

Unless running on eco mode, it is pretty loud. If you work from home, eco might be ok running in the background if you like white noise. The suction to empty the bin after docking is very loud but only lasts a few seconds.

It navigates pretty well, but I do find that it doesn't always get as close to walls/edges as I would like, especially where our carpeted staircase meets the main floor. It is tall enough that it is unable to navigate beneath most of our furniture.

I've found the schedule feature doesn't work well for us. It will run for an hour only before docking, whereas running on manual it will run for nearly 2 hours at a higher suction.

This obviously isn't a miracle product that eliminates the need to manually vacuum altogether, but it is a Godsend in maintaining the piles of hair that can accumulate in a short time and saves my back from having to manually vacuum constantly just to keep up with the hair."
4,Great in all aspects but one ...,"Compared to the competitors (you know whom I'm talking about) the Shark is a fantastic bargain.
In every aspect; ease of setup, ability to reach small spots (especially under furniture), ease of cleaning and emptying it, ease of hooking it up to other Smart Home devices such as Alexa, its ability to clean all surfaces, the way it gobbles up pet hair, quietness, etc., etc., etc., this vacuum is better than all of the other products out there, or at the least, as good as one costing twice as much.

Except ... It just doesn't map well. I should clarify that; it doesn't map well in my house and in the houses of some other people we know who use it. We do have friends who have been successful with mapping, but not us.

If you have not used one of these, note that they map the house themselves; as they zoom around and scare the cat, they are making a map of your house. Depending on the size of your house that might be accomplished in a few cleanings or it might take many cleanings (remember, at 2x a day, 20 cleanings will only take10 days).

However, it just hasn't come even anywhere near close to correctly mapping our house. Granted, it's a fairly large house (6,000+ sq ft) and it's not exactly regularly shaped. However, although it cleans the whole house, it seems to do so haphazardly. Once the house is mapped, you can name areas of the map so that you can tell the Shark to clean the bedroom or the kitchen. However, it it doesn't map correctly, you can't tell it that because frankly, I have no idea what the map it has drawn represents. The ""home"" base for the Shark is right in the middle of the house. The map shows it at one end corner and everything else is on one side of that ""home"" position. We know that it cleans both sides of the house, we see it doing that, but we can't place it on the map.

Note to the manufacturer: It would be nice if I could follow the Shark on the map, that way I would be able to look at the Shark, look at the map, and see where it thinks it is on that map.

With that said, it's too bad that we can't tell Alexa to tell the Shark to clean the master bedroom but, our house is clean. It does seem to get all around the house although in a haphazard manner. And we don't know where it has been or what it has done unless we are watching it (which is amusing in the beginning but after a while only the cat cares).

If this thing could map properly, I'd give it six stars! But alas ..."
4,Worth it!,"My husband is the king of robot vacs. He researches and studies and compares and watches for sales. We've gone through several generations of robots - all of a competitor's brand - and have really liked them. But we decided to try this Shark Self-Empty because of the great reviews and the sale price. We have one HUGE dog that sheds like crazy, and two Labs that shed more than you'd think. All our floors are tile, and we live in a rural ag area surrounded by dirt. So far, we have been very happy with the quality of vacuuming by the Shark. It picks up the hair, crumbs, and dirt in general, but I still need to wet mop a couple times a week. It gets in the corners pretty well, the dog hair doesn't clog up the rollers, and so far, I haven't noticed that it leaves black marks on our white woodwork like the other brand does. (But we've only been using it about three weeks.) We do not use the app as we are old and retired and find it easier to bend down and push the start button. We do use the magnetic boundary strips which are very helpful and we may buy some more. It took a couple weeks for it to establish its routes and runtime schedule. At first it wouldn't run very long (like 20 minutes?); then the next time it would run for a long time (closer to 45 minutes); then go short, then long, etc. Now it runs a good hour, self dumps, then heads out again if needed. My husband has dumped it twice - not because it was full - but because he was curious about how much gunk was in there and to see if it was a hassle to empty. (It was pretty easy.) Now he is just letting it do its thing and it still isn't full. He is sold on the Shark, and we would buy another one IF we could find the wall space for it. You have to have a certain amount of unobstructed wall space near an outlet which isn't easy to find in our home!"
4,Adequate for my purpose,"I have a recently acquired 80 lb puppy that sheds (Known as Sir Sheds-a-lot). I went from vacuuming once weekly to nearly every day. I wanted to try a robot vacuum. There are so many out there and I didn't want to make a ginormous investment (there are vacuums out there upwards of $1500) if it didn't do what I expected. Here's what I did. I vacuumed my living room (14' x 20') with my upright (also a Shark). The following day I used the robot. I ran it twice (the bottom pile was the result of the first, top - second). I could still see some dog hair on my area rug, but otherwise it seemed to pick up hair and soil. Bottom line - I think this will work for me to a degree. I will still use my upright, likely once a week, to get the edges (and because the power brush seems to work better). But on a daily or every other, I'll let this baby go and keep the volume of hair down.

Update: After almost a month, I'm still satisfied. I read in a few other posts that they only empty the receptacle once a month. I do this daily. I also clean the filter (see new photos). I use a can of compressed air to free the dust. You may think that the compressed air can get costly?? but if it will help with the performance, and prolong the life of the vacuum it's a small price to pay. One can should last you well over a month if you're doing it daily, and far longer if it's weekly."
4,"Self empty, bag less.","I like the self empty bag less, voice control and mapping. I don't like the loud sound it made while vacuuming on the hard floor, but it is quiet on the carpet. I am looking for the brand that is quieter before considering the return. Overall performance is acceptable."
4,Does what I want,"We have a dog that sheds as much as two. I bought it mainly for the kitchen where she spends most of the time and we track in everything from outside and it does a great job on the hard floors. I'm not impressed with it on carpet, especially the high traffic areas that are more flat. It doesn't do great with the dog hair. I have my Dyson that I use regularly so the Shark is just used nightly on the hard floors and every other day on the carpet to keep things looking decent between ""real"" vacuuming. The battery has about 40% left when it heads back to the dock from doing the carpet in the living, dining and entry - about 1000 sq ft. All in all, I'm happy with it for what I paid - it was 50% off plus I had some rewards so I paid less than 200.00. I wouldn't be as happy with it for 600.00 though, might have returned it."
4,"9 months out, battery stopped working","This is our second one and now for the last month we have had issues with the battery. It is only 8 months old. I will contact customer service today but not looking forward to the hassle of having to send it in, be charged for a new battery less than a year into the purchase. The first one we bought is going strong after 2 years, so maybe this one is a lemon?!?"
4,Super nice product,Cleans perfect and the App it’s very easy to use
4,Reliable robot vac thats eats and cheap(ish) to maintain.,"Previously used IRobot Roombas for years up to the s9+ self-emptying model. I’ve been using the Shark AV2511ae for a year and I prefer the Shark over the Roomba by a wide margin.
+The Shark’s navigation is superior. The Shark rarely gets stuck, lost or confused
+ The Shark is kinder to furniture and rugs than the Roomba. My Roomba’s had a tendency to bang into chair legs and the like pretty hard. Also if the Roomba had difficulty getting onto a thick rug it would grind away at it for quite a while until it gave up.
+ Maintenance is simpler and less frequent than the Roomba. Previously I would need to do a partial disassembly/cleaning almost every week on the Roomba and/or emptying base. Now I clean the vac and base about once a month
+ Replacement parts are cheaper. Pretty low bar there, iRobot parts are not cheap.

In fairness the Roomba is a more powerful vacuum and, when it works as designed, does a better job at cleaning."
4,Pet obstacles,"Update - Amazon has made this right and is sending me a replacement after speaking to customer service. Hopefully the new vac will do much better!!

I am not happy. I have used me vac twice and the second time of use I was away from home and my dog pooped on the bathroom rug. I was in the understanding the vacuum would NOT have ran this over. Because it did that was poop all over the bathroom and there is poop all ever the bottom of the vacuum. I am not happy about this!!"
4,Vacuum,"This was a gift for my daughter. She is very happy with it. It picks up the light dirt but not everything . It can’t get into corners, but for every day clean up it works well for her . She has had it for a while and it’s still working, that is a big plus !!"
4,Premium Vacuum for a mid-range vacuum price,"TLDR: this vacuum can run with the best of them in the premium tier at virtually half the price. It's not a complete replacement for manually vacuuming/sweeping, but it'll cut the need for it down to about once a week or so.

Pros:
- It really does save time
- Self emptying sounds gimmicky but it's 100% worth the extra money in the long run
- Helps manage pet hair pretty well
- Cleans methodically ONCE IT's MAPPED

Cons:
- Unable to create virtual ""no go"" areas on the map. Sharks solution is to lay tacky looking boundary strips instead (🤮)
- Power switch location
- Does not support multilevel mapping (CURRENTLY. Rumor has it that Shark is looking to add this)

I'll start off by saying that overall, I'm very happy that I got this vacuum. We have an Australian Sheppard and she sheds like no other. This vacuum does a great job vacuuming up her hair* (I'll come back to this) for the most part. The self emptying feature really makes this vacuum feel like an autonomous assistant.

Here's some information about what this vacuum cleans at my house:
- Ceramic tile
- Laminate plank flooring
- Carpet

To my surprise, it actually cleans pretty consistently across all 3 types of floors.

Cleans up pet hair?
Yes to an extent. If the pet hair is clumped up on hard floors, the vent on the side of the vacuum will blow them around like tumble weeds and cause them to be missed. For most pet hair on hard floors, it actually gets it pretty well. On carpet, it performs much better in this regard, since the hair doesn't tumble nearly as much.

THINGS TO THAT COULD BE IMPROVED:

Is the mapping good?
The mapping is... there. It's okay. I mean, it's better than not having mapping at all, but it's not exactly mind blowing. The biggest con with mapping is that it takes a good chunk of cleanings to finish the map. You can ""speed up"" this process by running it more frequently but you're probably looking in the range of 15-30 cleanings for the map to finish.

Doorstops?
Man. Door stops are this things kryptonite. If you have the baseboard mounted spring doorstop style of doorstops, and they're mounted about 2"" off the ground, there's a possibility that they turn off the power via the side switch. I very much wish that Shark decided to have the power switch be on the bottom or top of the robot for this reason.

THINGS THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IN THE FUTURE:

- It would be cool to have different areas/rooms in the map be able to have suction levels associated with them. (ex carpet is in the living room so have high suction there but laminate is in the hallway so have medium suction there, etc.)

- Multilevel mapping. I mean ideally I'd like to just have 2 vacuums (one for each floor) but it'd be nice if there could be a self emptying docking station on each floor for the one Shark vacuum. As much as I love this vacuum, I don't think I'll be springing another $450 for one anytime soon."
4,it takes a lot to impress me.,"While this robot is kinda stupid still, Once it got stuck under the couch, however it only did it once. There is a low suspension bar that it got rammed under. I also picked up some paper and a sock that pretty much stopped it from doing it's job. But overall, I am pleased with the job. I have a few no go zones, that sometimes it still finds it way into. While the mapping will inherently get better, I'm hoping in 3 years (when the warranty, bought extended) the truly ""AI"" will be much better, I think AI, is just a verbage ... I don't really see mch AI going on here. But, it does work... and I'm pretty happy with the results. My home is a lot less Dusty. When the high winds do pick up.... I run it every day and cuts the dust down a lot! To be honest, my floors have every looked this good (all the time). Saves me a ton of time."
4,Let me sleep,My only dislike is setting the cleaning time. I’m ready to set it back to factory settings to see if I can get it to work on my time. Set it to clean at 10:00 am Monday Wednesday and Friday. Instead it cleans at 3:00am on the set days waking me up until I can send it home. Otherwise I am really happy with it. And I’ll get it figured out!! ( I’m stubborn. )May have to give up and chat with support.
4,"Good overall, but glitchy","I was having trouble keeping my apartment clean because I have a cat and the litter and fur were everywhere, and I just couldn't vacuum my whole place every day. I figured I'd give a robot vacuum a try, and this one was on a very good sale and had the self-empting base, which I liked. So far, it has been a game changer. My apartment is so clean. It does a very good job if you leave it in the high setting, or use the matrix clean option. I wouldn't use it in the lower setting because it doesn't pick up very well. My only issue with the vacuum is that it is very glitchy. It gets lost somewhat frequently, and sometimes it just cleans the same area over and over again and the only way to stop it is to pause the vacuuming and then restart it. I wouldn't run the vacuum when I wasn't home because I would be afraid something would go wrong and I wouldn't be there to fix it,. So that much isn't very good. Nevertheless, I'm still happy with the vacuum and will definitely buy another one of these robot vacuums when this one dies. I don't know if it will be a Shark or another brand."
4,Works great but battery doesn’t last,I loved this item except for the fact that it died after 1 room and often died before making it back to the charger. If this wasn't a problem I would’ve kept this item and bought another one as a back up.
4,Shark Robot Vacuum,"UPDATE: I still like the vacuum. It does help with pet hair. I’m dropping my rating by one star because we have a faulty side brush screw. One of the side brushes has not been able to spin freely since we got it, but now it isn’t working much at all, if any. As a result, the robot thinks there is an obstruction and flashes an error. It would seem you could fix this by loosening the screw, but I will have to pack up and return the entire unit and Shark will ship me a new one. Customer Service appears to be operating out of India, which is fine, but I did get transferred 4 times, repeating my phone number each time before finally getting to the right person, who was very helpful and clear. They also waived the $35 shipping fee since we just got the vacuum. I’m a little frustrated, but I’m hopeful the next unit will make it to me safely and work as it should.

Overall, I’m giving this a 5 star rating because, while it’s not perfect, so far I think it’s worth the money and I don’t have any significant complaints. We’re just getting to know each other and I think it will take some time for us to understand one another so I’ll follow up later if my thoughts change. There’s some prep work involved: pick up dog toys, water bowls, cords, your messy husband’s socks from under the bed and clothes draped on chairs...I thought I covered those things pretty well, but I did miss an extension cord next to our sofa. (Toothless) rolled right over it. I noticed it because it did make some noise. I have some curtains that just graze the floor. It got right next to them, but no issues with them being caught in the brush or roller. I did not pre-vacuum our floors and it did leave some bigger debris on its first pass. It is doing great on dog hair! The first three pictures show the results after 30 minutes on the hard floor. The fourth picture shows a chunk of dog toy it found on the carpet. When it picked that up, it paused with an error to clean the brush roll. All that hair and dirt in that picture is inside the dust bin. The last picture is the bathroom rug, which does not have a rubber backing and slides easily. The robot just pushed it. It did fine with my other 3 rugs, even one with a thick, shaggy pile. Unlike other reviewers, I am not going to obsess about how the robot chooses to sweep my floors because it doesn’t have to clean like I do. As far as noise, it’s slightly louder than my bathroom fan and is louder on hard floors than on carpet. It is nowhere near as loud as my Shark Navigator upright vacuum. The loudest it got was when it picked up a hard candy. The set up is not hard. The app is maybe slow to communicate with the robot, but it’s simple to use. The dock bin is easy to empty. And I typed all of this while a little robot swept my floors without complaining. I’m satisfied."
4,"Gets 95% right. Needs multiple map saving, and homing zone of smaller floor space.","PROs. 1) It cleans well for keeping hard floors dust free after a first thorough manual cleaning. 2) It carries out functions of self docking, self emptying, and creating an accurate map after the initial exploration. 3) It is bagless 4) It runs for 90 minutes on a hard floor.

Room for Improvement. 1) Only one map allowed, limiting use to a single level. Advice is to enable multiple saved maps like Ecovacs latest models. Even better, allow importing of house plans of floors, preferably allowing adjustments on a PC. 2). The homing requires valuable floor space, missing from many homes, i.e. a hemi-ellipsoid of 5 ft diameter on one axis, and a radius of 4 feet on the other. Find some other homing method in a small space.

Note to newbies: These do not clean up debris larger than a grain of rice; you need to first make the floor spotless, dry and free of strings, wires, ribbons, rubber bands, long hair, clothing, tassels, insects, cereal... The floor must be dry and grease free, so pet, food and toddler messes will foil automation and warranty. Secondly, to take advantage of robot vacs ability to get under furniture, invest in risers for couches.

Note on refurbished units: The first shipment was 70% incomplete and banged up; perhaps it had been intercepted and forced open by thieves. The second appeared new, except for a small ball of debris in the vacuum's onboard bin, and, it was missing a spare side brush. Just check refurbished units immediately."
4,"So far so good, with only one odd occurrence","I have had this for a few weeks, and had it set up on the base, but had not performed a cleaning run until yesterday. During the time it was just sitting on its base, the power at my house went out, and when I went into the room where the dock is, the vacuum had come off the dock and did not go back on. Once I got it back to the base, it was fine.

I have it set up in my basement, which is partially finished with carpet. I closed the door to the mechanical room so it could not get in there. I watched it for part of the time while it was doing its run, and like the videos from Shark show, it basically goes in rows across the floor. My basement is pretty much L shaped, with a couch, bookcase, desk, a couple of DVD cabinets, and workout equipment against the walls. It was able to navigate to the obstructions, and once it figured out it could not go any farther, turned, and kept going. It seemed to get up the few specks on the floor well and returned to the base without a problem after about 35 minutes. It should be noted, that the carpet in the basement is basically brand new, and there are no kids or pets that go down there to get it dirty. Nor, do I have any area rugs or things that have caused other reviewers issues.

If needed, I will update my review down the line. To be upfront, I also have a Roomba I7+ which I use on my main floor. While I cannot do a direct comparison of the two because I have things like area rugs and more obstructions in the middle of the room on my main floor, I can say that the mapping features seem pretty similar between the two, with the Shark able to produce a map after the first run, where the Roomba took two runs to fully map room and give me an editable map. But, as I said, my basement has a far more basic setup with fewer obstructions.

Overall, I like it so far. If not for the weird issue with it coming off the base during the power outage, and not returning to it, I would have given it five stars. It does seem like when it is off the base the battery drains pretty quickly, but it does not take an extremely long time to charge up. I will update the review down the line if necessary, but so far, I like it."
4,Good robovac choice,"I've had the Sharp robot vacuum for about a week and so far I'm very pleased. I previously had a lower level Roomba and thought it did a pretty good job for what it was. After about three and a half years it was still running but had lost most of its suction power. Looked at the available Roomba models on Amazon and came across this one from Sharp at what I thought was a good price. I have found it to be better than the Roomba in most ways. The Roomba was often difficult to get on the dock to charge. The Sharp docks itself flawlessly. The only thing that I have found lacking is battery power. The Roomba would run for about two to two and a half hours before either docking or just stopping. The Sharp only runs about one and a half hours before returning to the dock. But after charging for about three hours, it automatically starts back vacuuming where it had left off and docks when finished, a really good feature. If it lasts three years it will be well worth it."
4,Great vacuum for small daily cleans,"This vacuum works great for dog hair. I run this every day while I am at work and it takes approximately 3 hrs to clean 1800 sqft in a single floor home with the matrix clean mode.

If you have pets I would recommend cleaning it at least once a week. The 1st picture is of just 2 days of cleaning with one German Shepherd.

Ever since I started using this vacuum I no longer notice any tumbleweeds and it has significantly cut down on the Dust and pet dander.

I would however recommend if you have carpet that whenever you first get it to remove the three screws (2nd Pic) that hold the brush assembly in the bottom. I kept getting notifications and finding it randomly sitting in rooms because the brush gets clogged with hair and carpet fiber on the bearing surfaces causing it to get stuck.

If you include that in the weekly cleaning you will have no issues."
4,Works as advertised.,"Have not used voice control, but love not having to dump machine daily. My wife loves how it cleans in nice, neat straight lines instead of sporadic angles. Works well from what we have seen so far."
4,Requires a little upkeep..,"Got this as an early Christmas present to clean up all of the hair and dirt off of the hardwood and tile floors. What sounds better for this task than a Shark hair-wrap-free brush roll, right? Read on...

Robot ""assembled"" easy, don't even need to read the instructions, everything is pretty much intuitive through markings or on the app. Set up the dock, remove all the stickers, turn the bot on, hold clean and dock buttons, sync to Wifi, sync to app and you are in service. Add shark skill to Alexa for voice control and can utilize that as well (her lengthy explanations of what she can do gets old. A shorthand version would be nice).

Running. The manual cleanings, the robot goes around at random, bumping things at a moderate intensity and creating a map of the house. It moves the restricted zone strips on hard flooring every time it runs into it. It transitions well over rugs and small wooden floor dividers. Somehow it has managed to not entangle itself in thicker cables and wires by driving itself back over them to escape. It has closed the door on itself by bumping it closed from full open.

The cleaning is fairly good, suction is good enough that I have found a quarter sized coin in the robot's dust bin (not the self-empty dock, though). The dock suction is okay, but hair and hairballs often get stuck hanging out of the rear of the bot. The bot puts out a moderate amount of noise, just enough that you can turn up the volume of the tv and ignore.

The mapping of the house took approximately 35 cleanings to get a 3rd stage, usable map, at about 2 weeks of usage.

There was one point when it went under my son's bed and i could hear it from all the way down the hall, sounding like an apache attack helicopter. I disassembled the brush and bin (where I found the coin in it) emptied it out, cleared the wheels of any debris, and noticed a massive amount of hair and thread/stringers that was wrapped around the driven end of the no-wrap brush. After removing all of the hair and thread and reassembling the robot, it began to work like new at a much quieter rate. So if yours sounds like it is about to strafe your house, pull out and clean the roller brush.

Otherwise, I have had no notable issues since owning this cleaning vacuum. I would recommend buying if you don't want to spring for a Roomba.

Do note the self-empty bin is quite loud when it docks."
4,Pet hair,I like the product it’s just not good for a household with a lot of animals. A regular stand up vacuum is better for that. I also feel the product works a little better on surfaces without carpet.
4,Louder than expected,"Does a decent job, louder than expected while running and don't jump when it empties itself- extremely loud! It is slower than previous ones but the cost was lower so you do get what you pay for! Lol"
4,Better than I expected,"I have been using this robot for 2 months now. I have a German Shepherd and a yellow Lab Retriever, so pet hair is a major concern for me. I run the robot on the main level (about 550 sq ft) of my home at least 5 times a week. It does a great job on the hard floors, and fair on the low-pile area rugs. That's fine with me - I only have to drag out the big vacuum once a week as opposed to the 2 to 3 times a week previously. I haven't had any problems with the dust cup or self-emptying feature. It always amazes me how much hair it picks up every day.
I can't speak to the scheduling feature or operation. I have to run it while I'm home. This has nothing to do with the robot, but rather my German Shepherd who seems to think the robot is a reluctant playmate and only needs a little encouragement to play dog-games. I caught him tossing toys at it and trying to pounce on it. I sincerely doubt being squashed by an 85 lb dog is going to be covered under the warranty :)
It is a bit noisy on the hard floors, but not a deal breaker for me. I have mostly run it on the evacuate and resume. That usually gets me 60 to 90 minutes of cleaning time which is fine for the size of the area.
I changed my wifi password and that created a problem with the robot. I tried everything within the app and nothing worked. I finally called Shark and the representative made it sound like this happens all the time. The solution: remove the robot and add it back in as though a new set up.
All in all, I'm happy with my purchase."
4,"Setup was easy, works well, but loud.","So far it performs well. Easy to setup. But it is LOUD. I liked running my old one later at night, after my kids go bed and I clean up."
4,Noisy and doesn’t appear to go everywhere:,I keep hoping it’ll get better at getting all the way to the wall. Nope. Also very noisy so bad it sounds like something is wrong.
4,I bought 3 so here's the tea,"I bought 3 of these on black Friday for my mother, father, and myself. We have currently been running 2 of them on different floors of the house at the time of this review. One floor of the house is mostly tile while the other floor is mostly carpet.

Mostly Title Floor: the robot works amazing! it has picked up so much and as someone that doesn't like to sweep/vacuum, it is going to be a lifesaver. However, it gets stuck sometimes and has been having a hard time mapping half of my living room, but I have just been picking it up and moving it to the section it needs to map and that is doing the job of getting my full map. I am hoping that once it has a full map I will be able to just run it and not have to worry about it but that will properly take another 3 to 5 runs. It is finding its way to the dock fairly easily within 5 minutes of the cycle end now but the first few runs took like 20 minutes.

Mostly Carpet Floor: On this floor, we are having a little more trouble running it. As it is carpet we want the max suction, but you can't automatically set it to suck the max you have to remember to change it every time. On the max section it gets most of the stuff from the carpet, but on the middle suction level, we notice that things are left behind. However, once it did its first 2 runs and found all the stuff that it will get caught in it can now run the whole floor without stopping. However, for some reason it is having a hard time finding its dock still and will sometimes run out of battery before it gets there, give up, or take an obnoxious amount of time to find it. we are hoping the more we run it the easier it will find its dock.

Overall:
Would I buy again? Yes.
You need a little patience setting up the machine and making your house robot friendly, but once it is mapped and you have boundaries up, it will work like a charm. A majority of the negative reviews here expected it to work perfectly right out of the box and the only thing it can do out of the box is vacuum you have to give it time to learn your house.

Lastly: the noise is nothing compared to a normal vacuum it is more on the level of a white noise machine. I sleep through it the dogs sleep through it and a majority of the time I run it when I am at work, so I don't hear the noise anyway. However, I would rather hear a noise so I know if it is working or something is caught or it isn't sucking as much. but to each their own."
4,Good service,This is my second Shark like this. I had an issue with the new unit and they replaced it super fast. Good customer service.
4,Shark AI Matrix Clean,"Ease of setup, quality of cleaning, obstacle sensing, battery life, app, and programming are all a drastic improvement from my dated robot vacuum predecessor. The only area for improvement would be a little more accurate mapping process."
4,Not getting stuck,"Our shark does a great job of cleaning up tile, low to medium pile rugs. It does not like high thick rugs, gets caught up. Self cleaning and returning to dump itself at the docking station works great. We just close the doors to rooms with high pile rugs."
4,Mostly great,"I've had this vacuum for about three months now. With a cat, a dog, and two children, our floors get messy quickly. In lieu of vacuuming 2x a day, we bought this to do the work for us while we are not home. And it works well. Mostly. My biggest complaint is that if you get anything stuck in the brush roll, the error message keeps popping up on the app, even days after the problem is cleared and the vacuum has done other successful runs. The only way I have been able to stop the error message is by uninstalling the app and then reinstalling it. It would be easier if everyone in the house instead just picked up all their socks, but hey, that's not realistic, is it? I also get random error messages from my vacuum at times that it's not running (midnight & about 2am). The message says that it experienced an error, but it's just sitting on its dock (clearly not running during the times that would wake us).

Update: brush roll is stuck (not), and this time, no matter what I do, I can't get the error message to go away. Unfortunately, this means that the app is pretty much useless."
4,Good for a 1.0 product,"The Shark IQ R101AE is not my first robot vacuum as I have a Roomba E5 as well. In a way this has played out to Shark's advantage since most of the robot-proofing I had to do around my apartment was already done.

What enticed me to buy the Shark IQ R101AE are the two extra features (big ones) that you get for the same price as the Roomba E5: smart navigation and the auto-empty bin. The smart navigation has resulted in a more predictable cleaning pattern and I appreciate that. Whereas the Roomba E5 bounces around like a pinball, the Shark IQ has a more linear approach. The result is that even if the Shark IQ has less battery life, it makes better use of it wasting less time. It also has fewer problems than the Roomba E5 finding its charging base,

The Auto-empty bin is a huge hit. It has reduced maintenance to once a week as opposed to after every cleaning job. Arguments can be made in favor of the expensive Roombas that have the auto-empty base that uses bags to keep dirt contained. But I appreciate not having to buy bags every few months. It just takes a little more care to empty the bin on your trash can and not spread the dust around.

As for actual cleaning, the Shark IQ does a decent job, about as good as the Roomba E5 or close enough. The Shark IQ is less noisy though -- the robot itself; the auto-empty base is a different story. The Shark IQ also does better climbing on places where the Roomba E5 gets stuck.

There are only two cons I can mention about the Shark IQ. First one is the mobile app. It is a bit unstable. It throws errors when trying to update your profile and when registering your robot for warranty purposes. It is not optimized for iPads, and it makes the process of labeling rooms in your home more complicated than it needs to be. The second big con about the Shark IQ is their implementation of no-go zones. That annoying black tape that you have to cut to size and place in front of (or around) areas you don't want the robot to touch, is a process straight out of last decade. Even the virtual walls of Roomba are a better solution, although in this day and age there's no excuse for not being able to set no-go zones via the robot's mobile app.

I was worried that Shark could make a mediocre robot so as to not cannibalize on the sales of their traditional vacuums. I'm relieved to say that Shark did a good job with their R101AE robot. Did they do their best job? Is their flagship robot as good as it can be? Not at all, but it is a good first attempt at a smart navigation robot."
4,its not perfect but works well now we have figured out its quirks.,"generally it works well we clean it out and wipe the sensors about once a month, its been a life saver with the dogs and the dirt they bring in, it copes well on our hard floors and transitions well between the hard floors and medium pile rug under the coffee table. the software app can be a bit fussy, we had it on a schedule and it would try and clean twice a day even though it was only told to run once, after disabling the return to base to charge during run that was fixed, oddly even though it had plenty of battery left it would go home to charge half way through a cleaning run then resume later, we disable the charge mid run and it has plenty of battery to get round 1500sq. we run it every day and it takes about an hour, we havn't used the regular mains vacuum for several months we just do the bits the robot cant get to with the cordless dyson v8. i like to walk bare foot in the house on hard floors and the robot works well as there is no dirt/dust stuck to my feet ever anymore.

its not perfect but for the $400 we paid its plenty good enough at half the price of its nearest competitor, their support line is surprisingly pretty helpful too. it sure as hell beats the hell out of traditional vacuuming.

As for what others have said its fussy about building the map of the floor plan. yes i can agree with that to a point, eventually it does figure it out. i'd say to those people that are worried about it stop worrying about it. Just ignore the thing, and let it clean, it will eventually figure it out as we have found.

noise wise we have it on max suction and its not too bad, it can be a little noisy and you may need to turn the tv up a few clicks or go to a different room if your on the phone but its significantly quieter than a conventional vacuum cleaner.

on the whole its not a bad product and gives us extra time around the house for other things, we can be out in the yard enjoying the grill, fire pit, hot tub while its vacuuming for us inside. the one thing they really need to add to the software is the ability for it to be able to store multiple maps for different levels of the house then it would be perfect."
4,easy to program and map,vacuum is good and it was easier to program and map then I thought it would be
4,"Overall Excellent Purchase, But Software Needs Improvement","I love the machine and it's a great timesaver. However, the software/firmware needs improvement.
1) Almost every day, it gets stuck giving an error that the dust cup is missing. This is always caused by hairs or a piece of cat kibble holding open the little door in the back that connects the robot to the dustbin. This could be fixed automatically by the dustbin running the transfer vacuum a couple of times on and off, to shake stuff lose in the dust cup. Since there is no manual way to make the transfer turn on (it only happens once when it returns to the dock, and removing the robot and putting it again doesn't run it), I have to pick out the hairs and things by hand. Again, this would not be an issue if this error caused the machine to troubleshoot itself by turning the transfer vacuum on and off a few times.
2) Though there is integration with Google and Alexa, you can only tell the robot to clean (everything), but not to clean a particular room. As a result, it's rather useless.. iRobot has that feature.
3) There is a scheduling function, but it does not allow scheduling particular rooms on specific days and times. I have two areas that I need cleaned twice a day, and others only twice a week, but I'm forced to run it everywhere often and then manually for the high-traffic areas. A simple software upgrade would fix this.
4) The app allows controlling the suction power (3 levels), but these can only be changed on a single run while it's in progress. There's no way to change the default, to change it on a schedule, or to do specific rooms differently. It would be great if it could do these things.
5) The robot limits itself to 60-minute runs, then returns to the dock to fully recharge before continuing again. For me, it often runs for 60 minutes and returns to the dock with little in the dustbin and 60% of the battery. Then it charges for an hour or so then goes on to complete the missing 5 minutes worth of work. That it doesn't try to complete the job when it has more than enough battery and bin space is inefficient and annoying. Especially when it then cancels the rest of the scheduled work because, as #1, above, a hairball holds the dustbin door open.
If there was an Advanced option on the app, where a power user like myself could edit settings in-depth, script, etc., I could fix the above issues myself."
4,A good product for the money,"So I have had this product for 4 months. Here is an unbiased review. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase and for the price I got the best robot I could afford. It does a very good job of cleaning. So much so that they sold me on the new iRobot mop I just ordered! Shark does not have one but I am sure they will at some point. But I am sold on automated cleaning systems like Shark.

PROS.
1. Price. I got it unsale for $399. That made it quite a bit less than a iRobot. I never had an iRobot and can't compare but given the price difference, I am happy.
2. Cleaning. Yes it does a very good job. You can't really appreciate how much until you empty the bin :-)
3. Gets under furniture including beds, etc.
4. I have 3 dogs and no problem with dog hair
5. Will clean and empty as necessary and then resume.
6. Returns to dock for recharge as needed
7. No proprietary bags like iRobot ($$$). They claim you empty every 30 days - impossible LOL. I empty out every other use and love to see how much it cleaned that even my own vacuuming missed.
8. Easy to use app and setup - everything worked on the first try. I use it on demand vs. schedule.
9. MAX mode for carpets and bigger messes. This dramatically reduces battery life. Tried eco mode and that is pretty useless.

CONS
1. It does require a 2.4Mhz vs. 5Mhz network. It WILL connect to the 5Mhz but will not work properly. If you don't have a 2..4, your internet provider can walk you through it (easy to do!)
2. Gets lost. About 20% of the time, it gets lost going back to the dock. You can page it. Other times it wonders aimlessly trying to find the dock. Sometimes I have to shut it off and bring it to the dock. A minor inconvenience tha better software updates in the future should fix :-)
3. Not really a 90 minute charge. I find that when it gets close to 30-40%, it will return and re-charge and empty. So on average It cleans 50-60 minutes before it returns - but it does have an auto-resume function
4. Mapping software. Trying to figure out what room is which is pretty impossible. At least they way it mapped my one story home which has lots of big rooms vs. many small ones.
5. Sometimes cleans the same spots several times before moving to the next section. Not sure why since nothing in the house has changed - no kids to move furnitures so you think it would figure it out after 4 months."
4,RV1001AEC will not connect to app/WiFi. Updated review,"I ordered the Shark RV1001AE. I received the Shark RV1001AEC. I can't find anything on that model nor any explanation for an added letter.
It will not connect to the app or WiFi through my Android device. I called Shark Customer service. They had me troubleshoot everything I already tried that was in the manual/app and it still won't work. They said their advanced team was unavailable and they'd call me back...
Update: Their customer service system is ridiculous. When your issue cannot be solved by doing exactly what your manual tells you they escalate you to the advanced team. They can not transfer you, you have to wait for a call back and if you don't answer you have to call them back and start all over. If you do answer but are not at home they will call you back, eventually. They ask for good call back times, but don't call back during those times. After close to two weeks of phone tag it finally works.
It works great, usually. It cleans well. I was afraid our dogs would freak out because they hate vacuums and remote control cars, but they couldn't care less. In fact they won't even move for it. The map is accurate but I suggest putting it on eco the first few times so it can be completed on one battery charge. Occasionally, it goes all random and uses up the battery before it's completed cleaning. But someone told us to expect that for the first two weeks. So we'll see..."
4,You still need to vacuum!,Put pick ups daily dust and cat fur but still need to vacuum weekly for a deep cleaning.
4,It works,Works great. The mapping is a little off. But getting it better with each run.
4,False advertising,Cleans well if I clean the brushes every few days. Storage of dirt and hair was full in 5 days. I gave this a 4 star as it was advertised as self cleaning brushes and 60 day storage capacity. Not even close.
4,Great,It does a great job cleaning my house. The only problem I have with it is that no matter how many times I set it to program my house it never looks right. So I’m unable to figure out rooms or able to block some areas.
4,"Good, but Not a Full R'eplacement","Here’s the basics:
Pros:
Travels the floor logically
Gets under items a normal vacuum can’t.
Empties when it goes back to its base. Can be set to do this more often (recommended)
Good for a regular clean in between vacuuming.
Moves from carpet to floor well.
Pricing for this is better that other models that are self-emptying

Cons:
Not a replacement for a regular vacuum.
Even though it self-empties, I have to clean out the cup and filters each time it’s used.
Mapping is not consistent.
Some settings, such as maximum suction have to be set each time it’s run.

I have both carpeting and animals, so my vacuums get a workout. Including the Shark, I have 3 vacuums: A classic yellow Dyson and a Bissell Adapt Ion Pet are the other two. One thing I like about the Shark is it travels in a logical manner back and forth instead of bouncing around. Another must have for me was that it could go and empty itself since these things can’t hold a lot. It also gets under things the Dyson can’t reach.

This is really best for smaller areas that have flooring rather than carpeting. It doesn’t have problems with area rugs and navigates them well from floor to rug and back. There’s no way this will replace my Dyson, especially with the animals. It does do a good job replacing where I used the Bissell sweeper as a quick pickup of pet hair in the kitchen.

One thing I don’t care for is I still have to clean out the dust cup and filters each time because pet hair gets trapped in there. If you don’t, you’re likely to get an error message the next time you use it. Compressed air works best to do this. The Shark (at least in my house) has to be used every day to be able to keep up, otherwise I might as well use the Dyson. If you have an apartment or small house with no pets, you might be able to set up the schedule and use this as your primary vacuum.

I purchased this in December, 2019. It took a long time to map the area. I ended up only using it for the living room, kitchen which is a big open area and the front room we use as an office and guest bath, which it can easily access. Even so, the map ended up being weird and I couldn’t really uses it to map out which area is which. After six months, I have deleted the map am letting it start over."
4,Most impressive Robo vac we have had,"This one is nice, we had one a few years ago and by the beginning of the 3rd yr it was done. We just tried 2 others and returned them for one reason or the other but kept this one. Easy to set up, mapping works great, goes over the area rug just fine, goes to certain areas and cleans as you tell it. When it goes back to the charger to charge after it’s charged it will go back to where it left off. All in all I would give it a solid 4 but the only complaint is it’s loud. We have to turn the music or tv up when it’s on. But we plan to keep Daisy, she’s doing a good job. Would be nice if it was a little less $ and a little quieter, it would have then received 5 stars……so close."
4,Cleans better than most I have had,Runs quiet.
3,Works well except vacuuming gets slightly better every day.,"Play Video
Update 8:
My robot has developed a leg fetish (see video), can someone recommend a good therapist for robots?

Update 7:
Cleans well except for any of the following when 1/4"" to 1/2"" long: thread, yarn, Doritos, felt, etc. I think it just needs a better brush. I'd trade the current tangle resistance brush for a brush that helped clean better any day. It is fun at parties though: Guest 1 drops a Dorito; Guest 2 steps on Dorito; I call: ""Alexa, tell Shark to clean dining room""; Guests laugh hysterically as Shark IQ drives over Dorito fragments leaving them undisturbed.

Update 6:
When you press the Play (labeled Clean) button in the Shark app, if you pick the option to clean up to 3 specific rooms, you cannot clean the last room entered on the map, it won't let you scroll that far (they put the button over that option) so you can scroll it into view but you can't hold the scroll position in view with one finger while clicking the option with the other, if you let go of the position to click the option it goes back behind the button so you cannot click it. So make sure the last thing you add to the map is a no-go area so that all of the other rooms are options when sending Shark to clean manually (you can always clean the ""hidden"" room via Alexa though).

Update 5:
Mapping has completed. Labeling rooms is not intuitive, after you add each room, it makes you rename all of the previous rooms you already defined and labeled as follows: Define room 1, give it a name, define room 2, give room 1 a name, give room 2 a name, define room 3, give room 1 a name, give room 2 a name, give room 3 a name ... So I have my rooms defined, I have one Shark IQ set up, I can send my Shark to clean a specific room as follows (paraphrasing because I don't remember the exact wording): Me: ""Alexa, ask Shark to clean the Family Room."" Alexa: ""Which Shark vacuum would you like me to use?"" Me: ""Shark"". That's right, I have one Shark and I named it Shark, but every time I tell Alexa to do something with my Shark, it asks me to pick a Shark out of the following set of Sharks: [Shark]. Shark app will not let you schedule cleaning of a room or a set of rooms. You can schedule when to clean everything, you can't schedule when to clean something. I want Shark to start cleaning after everyone has left for school and work, and I want it to finish before anyone gets back. Unfortunately, because it takes about 2.5 hours to clean my house, between, emptying and charging it finishes around 6 pm. We start getting home from work and school around 2 pm. So, I tried scheduling rooms through Alexa Routines. The only way you can schedule the Shark skill in Alexa is to schedule Alexa to ask you what you want the Shark to do. I tried using Google Assistant as outlined in the documentation found in the Shark app but Google Assistant can't find the Shark ROBOT service as described in the Shark IQ documentation. But I was able to schedule cleaning of 3 rooms a day so that the robot is always dormant while we are at home and every room gets cleaned every 24 hours: I used Google Assistant Routines to have Google Assistant tell Alexa what to tell the Shark to do, it works flawlessly. The hard part was setting up 10 ""Say something"" commands for each schedule: First ""Say something"" command tells Alexa which room needs to be vacuumed, the next 8 ""Say something"" commands in each Routine I put four spaces in (not sure if quantity matters) that pause Google Assistant long enough for Alexa to ask which of my one robots I want it to use, and the last Say command says: ""Shark"". So to schedule my Shark IQ to clean specific rooms at specific times on specific days I put a Google Mini next to an Echo Dot and the Google Assistant takes care of the schedule, the Google Mini tells the Echo Dot what to do, the Echo Dot then tells the Shark what to do. Rube Goldberg would be proud.

Update 4:
Scheduled runs often fail complaining: ""... cannot run because its dust cup is missing.""
So I may need to find the dust bin sensor and hard wire it to always report present since it often reports missing even though dust bin is properly inserted and latched. The only time I have ever removed the dust bin was to clear dust cup error.

Update 3:
New firmware today: V3.4.11-20191015V3.6.18-m149-Oct 26 2019MesaM1.8.20MesaB0.1.1S2.0.107 I wish they would publish change logs.

Update 2:
This is what I want before I give this product 5 stars (some of these features probably already exist for this product already but won't be enabled until mapping is complete):
1. Ability to get rid of BotBoundaries and instead draw boundaries on map.
2. Ability to give robot verbal hints about where a new dry spill is as in: Alexa, tell Shark to clean Kitchen Southwest. What I'd like that to do is imagine that each room has 9 dots: NW, N, NE, W, Center, E, SW, S, SE. Center is default. When you send it to a room it starts at the dot specified where W and E caused it to clean a third of the room first traveling N to S and S to N, N and S cleans a third traveling W to E and E to W, and NW, NE, SW, and SE start by cleaning a quarter of the room and sending to the center cleans third of the room first either traveling N to S or W to E, whatever it normally does when cleaning the whole floor. This way when you want to clean up a spill of dry goods you can send it to the point of nine closest to the spill in that room to start.
3. Ability to see location of robot on map in app. Helpful when you need to find robot for any reason but you can't hear in stereo. For me, using the existing find robot feature is like playing the game hotter colder as it only tells me if I'm getting closer or not each time it plays sound because I can't hear in stereo.

Update 1:
After I wrote my original review I noticed that the cleaning history was updating but the app said that it couldn't connect to my Shark. So I now think that there really was just an issue with Shark's servers. Day 1, no connectivity issues. Day after posting my review: no connectivity issues. The Shark has cleaned my house 25 times but says map is only 40% complete. The incomplete map that it won't let me edit yet looks 100% accurate and 100% complete. So I'm raising my rating from 1 star to 4 stars instead of 5. Next week if mapping still isn't finished I'll lower it to 2. After mapping is complete and I've been able to test all the features I might raise rating to five stars. So far, it has cleaned house well on schedule, alerts me at work when it gets stuck (now averages getting stuck less than once a day) so I can send one of my kids to get it up and running again. I wish it came with three times as much BotBoundary.

Original:
As soon as it installed firmware version V3.4.10-20190826V3.6.15-1321-Aug 27 2019MesaM1.8.2MesaB0.1.1S2.0.102 it could no longer stay connected to WiFi, so to control this vacuum by smartphone or voice you need a WiFi robot capable of turning the Shark IQ RV1001AE off, waiting 10 seconds, then turning it back on. I have two subnets/SSIDs, one mesh (Google WiFi), one not (Google Fiber's Built in WiFi). None of my other wifi devices at home have any trouble staying connected to either network. I've tried my Shark on both since the firmware upgrade, it disconnects from both. So it can still vacuum the whole house on a schedule, returning to base to empty and to charge on it's own. I just don't get notifications when it gets stuck, and I can't send it to go clean a specific room in my house without first walking over to the charging base, turning the vacuum off, waiting a few seconds, and then turning it back on. If the noisy vacuum interrupts a conversation, I can't pause it with my phone, I have to get up and press the Dock button or turn it off. Also, when it gets stuck, it usually gets stuck right when it starts working as one of it's wheels will slide off the side of the charging base ramp pad and somehow get stuck on the of the pad with the stuck wheel on the carpet but the ribbed side of the wheel stuck on the corner of the ramp."
3,Good While it Lasts,"First off it's pretty deceitful that they present reviews from many models on the same listing. I'm reviewing the Shark RV1001AE IQ Robot Self-Empty XL; AKA Carlos. Purchased in June of 2021...back when dinosaurs roamed the earth. Paid just shy of $350 for it (maybe on sale 50% IDRemember). When Carlos arrived I wanted to love him...and I did for about the first 1.5 years. Did he ever do a FANTASTIC job cleaning? No. But lets be real; it's not made to replace a standard vacuum, just allow you to use it much less often and THAT Carlos did! I have long hair that sheds everywhere, we live on a farm, have 2 indoor short hair Dachshunds, and 2 teenage boys (after proofreading this apparently my husband is doesn't contribute to the messy floor ;) ). There are 3 main entry doors that criss cross the living space and no one takes off their shoes....or boots at the door. Plenty of DIRT gets on our floor, and I hate to vacuum so, for the first year Carlos was godsent. Never had connections problems, although it is near impossible to use verbal commands through Alexa with the Shark app, never ran that down. I just programed a whole house/common areas cleaning everyday. The mapping was pretty shoddy the first go round, better after a delete and remap. Not perfect but acceptable. There were quarks from the get go but they have become exponentially worse over time to the point of writing this; literally 9 days out of 10 Carlos has some issue and doesn't clean the floor. When he does, he gets lost and confused like a drunkard just wonders around in little circles bumping into things and I have to pick him up and carry him home. Be aware that your floors have to be clean before Shark can ""clean"" them. That is to say you will need to remind them ""the living room is not your laundry hamper"" and pick up your kids socks, roll up their (insert electronic device name here) charging cords, barricade small Christmas Trees (Carlos HATES small Christmas Trees and will take them down with extreme prejudice!!!), Throw away any wayward dryer sheets that may have fallen on the floor and hide your shoes. One of Carlos' favorite games is to chuff one shoe off and hide it from you real good. You have to do all this or Carlos will run over and tightly wrap up in his roller or wheels every sock, dryer sheet, cord, shoe lace or dog blanket in his territory. I digress. I think the main issue is that Shark lost focus of the main issue; which is to clean the floor so we don't have to. Bells and whistles are nice; I bought it for some of the bells. But they've gotten preoccupied with making software that's missed the mark so widely that it's messing with the hardware. Carlos is much like a stray barn cat now. Mostly I don't know where he is or what he's doing, but he's not bothering anything and sometimes he shows up and catches a mouse so we let him sleep in the corner. The difference is I paid $350 for Carlos and I expected him to do better and last longer. I no longer recommend the Shark Robot Vacs and would not buy again at this price point. Please enjoy this picture of Carlos after I removed him from the CLIFF!! (not even any stairs, ledges, or even tall thresholds in our house) and got him back home to charge. Please forgive the splotch on him, a kid thought it was ok to unplug a B&B works wall flower and LAY it on Carlos where it promptly leaked out. BTW whatever is in those wall flower scents will melt right into the plastic of a Shark! Carlos is currently problem solving how to escape from the trap of the magnetic strip and VERY LOW profile rug he is ""caught"" between? The 2 floors are 100% flush with each other. He's been at it for 20 minutes now, stumbling around in that same 2 square foot area...and he's getting on my nerves."
3,"Lasted almost two years, good for light surface cleaning","Bottom line: with regular maintenance, this will lightly clean your floors for over a year but won’t last a long time. We ran it three times a week and still needed a push vacuum to get the deeper down dirt once a month.

September 2022: it gets stuck on things like thresholds that were no problem before. On the fourth call to customer service, it was determined that the robot was not repairable, so it cleaned three times a week for a 1.75 years = $1.25/cleaning. American Express should replace this with the extended warranty protection.
Customer service is pretty helpful and knowledgeable but the first call should have included adding my information to the database and logging my call as well as giving me the information that the third call did. The battery only charges to 80% now.

Summer 2022: still running strong. I set a reminder to clean it every four weeks when we got it. It’s not perfect though – when we vacuum with the Dyson standup, we get about the same amount of junk in one pass that the Shark does in a month.

Summer 2021: this thing really works. Highly recommend cleaning it every four weeks if you have hardwood floors, a small dog, and a cat. it does smell when it docks.
November 29, 2020: We have a five-year-old Roomba that we limped along for the last year without a dock because it quit working. The Shark (Bruce) is much quieter and does not bang into walls and furniture as violently as the Roomba did, but there are a few downsides:

⁃ Bruce requires 35 square feet of empty space on a wall. Around here, this is expensive real estate. Our main floor is about 800 square feet (although the map said 560 which is more accurate of the Shark-able area) so you can imagine that amount of space is hard to come by. The Roomba, God rest its soul, only needed about 4 square feet, and it did not mind the darkness under things so you could hide it.
⁃ Bruce requires the lights stay on. Since we are home almost 24/7 on zoom meets now due to COVID, one of the great things about the Roomba was the ability to block off the living room side of the house and have it clean that at night, then move it into the bedroom side of the house during the day.
⁃ I will miss the spot cleaning mode from Roomba. If I spill something dry, I could set the Roomba on that spot and hit a button and let it clean that area. Once the map gets done, you can clean by room - it’s not the same. Also apparently you can’t carry it to a different floor for cleaning as needed without messing up the map.
⁃ We have a screen-porch-turned-sunroom that is a couple of inches down, so I’m not sure if that can be cleaned at all since it’s supposed to make its own way everywhere. This thing constantly humps my bathroom scale and floor lamps so maybe it can make it back up the step plus a steep threshold. Edit: turns out it ignores the boundary strip underneath a cotton throw rug and appears to use the cliff sensors to not go over the threshold.
⁃ Speaking of the map, it seems like if you change the configuration of your furniture, it might confuse the robot. From other reviews, it sounds like the robot needs a large number of passes before it makes an accurate map, so you may have to delete it and start over if you move something it can’t get under.
⁃ This might sound paranoid, but it has a freaking camera on the top, which is probably part of its optical system, and likely does not transmit any images or video or store them. It’s still a little disconcerting, and a cat riding it in a shark costume is probably discouraged.
⁃ It would be nice if the app had the ability to stop it. It’s fairly quiet so I could potentially run this while I’m in calls but would need to be able to stop it if it gets too close or too loud, and the app seems like it would be a good place to do that. I could then start it again once I get off the call.
⁃ It would be nice to have an online user community so I can ask stupid questions there instead of calling someone or asking online.

It’s only been running an hour so far, but we will try this out and see if there’s a way to make it work in our space because it seems to do a nice job with our dog and cat hair. Time will tell how well it keeps up.

November 29, 2020, 10 PM
The place where we had the most room for docking was in our very dark bedroom. The blue lights on this unit are bright enough to light up a runway (some hyperbole here). Thank goodness we have black duct tape, but now we have a brand new shiny robot with black duct tape on it. First world problems, I guess.

December 4, 2020, 10 AM
The map is now reading 1700 square feet. That is absolutely not possible for a house that measures 35’ x 25’ on the outside. It still does a great job cleaning though, and it awkwardly manages to dock in a much smaller area. Even though it doesn’t hit things as hard as Roomba dead, there is a fair amount of white paint around the edges from our trim."
3,Seemed great at first - not so great at pet hair after all - went crazy later,"Back in perhaps 2016 I bought my first robot vacuum. It was an old Ecovacs model with zero smarts. Just press and go, and it would randomly wander the house vacuuming. For what it was, it actually worked okay. No mapping, no ""AI"", no self empty station. But with daily manual emptying of the bin, it worked alright and provided some amusement as it bumped aimlessly around the house.

Fast forward to 2023 and some years of not owning a robot vacuum and I decided to see what had changed. I have an upright Shark vacuum with the self cleaning pet hair brush rolls that has been kicking for years now and works great. So, I decided to try Shark over the big name robot.

Jumping around in the timeline of my tale here a bit, I eventually gave up on this Shark robot and went to the big name robot - and in the end the big name one was even worse. More on that later.

I set up the Shark with the 60 day self empty and set it to work mapping. It fairly accurately mapped my house in one go. I set a schedule for every other day and let it do its thing. It seemed to work quite well. It left nice carpet lines in the bedroom that really made my wife feel like it was doing work.

Within the first two weeks, some weaknesses showed themself - all surrounding pet hair. We have two dogs, and an old cat. So, lots of hair. The house is mostly tile, just two carpeted rooms. The vacuum picked up the hair well from each area at first. But it suffered quickly. First issue is that the brush roll ends absolutely wound themselves in hair to the point of absolutely seizing up. This after just a week or so. I had to rescue the vacuum after I got home from work - it had stalled somewhere in a state of immobility. This happened regularly.

The next issue with the hair is that the design of the channel between the brush rolls and the integral canister are not smooth - the include a row of metal ""blades"". I am unsure as to the reasoning here, but these blades grabbed onto hair and eventually built a dam of pet hair that prevented the robot from adequately vacuuming. Weird design.

The third issue as it relates to pet hair is that the bin doesn't seem to have any way to detect that it is nearing full. This means that the robot can be full of hair and it will not return to the base to empty until 30 minutes has passed. That is the timeframe for emptying. Once every 30 minutes or whenever it needs to charge. I believe in a pet hair heavy house of large square footage this is inadequate.

When you boil it down, I could live with these issues and just increase my manual maintenance of the bot. Because at first, otherwise, it worked great. But then one day it went haywire. It started to ignore drop offs, and would throw itself into our sunken living room and I'd find it stuck there (picture related). It even once threw itself into the shower while my wife was in there - this shower is a step down from the bathroom. Her face was covered in soap when something crashed in and started talking! She was very unhappy, carpet lines or not.

Beyond that it started to ignore its map, going into rooms that we had previously precluded from mapping, meaning it would get stuck on obstacles or under furniture it couldn't navigate.

And so in the end I gave up on this guy, ordered a big name robot, and repurposed this one. I cleaned it up and gave it to my dad who has no pets, no sunken living room, and a pretty simple layout with no carpet. I suspect it will work well for him.

Sadly the big name robot didn't fare better. Worse, actually. A review for another day."
3,Still going strong after 4 1/2 years… still doesn’t see obstacles very well,"3.5 stars overall.

I bought the RV1001AE back in November of 2019 and am just now looking at a replacement. Not due to product failure but because I’m looking at a 2-in-1 to save time and floor space etc. In a time when most appliances seem to have planned obsolescence it’s worth noting this is still a very good machine after almost 5 years of regular use.

For context-
I have one cat, hardwood floors, and no carpet just a few low pile area rugs. It works well for me on a single level with 900 -1200 sqft apartments I’ve had.

Works well on hard wood and ok on small area rugs. Cleans up cat litter and hair well in general.
———
Noisy. Not as much as an upright or stick vacuum but still very noisy due to the mars-rover style wheels and emptying into the canister.

It will get stuck at least once a week but this is probably fixed with better sensors in the newer models by now.

This version has single pass only and I’ve noticed it can get turned around by my cat or myself if I move something in or out of it’s planned path.

Does not see obstacles well and I would recommend watching it closely the first time and putting down strips for areas it shouldn’t go. For example it gets stuck inside of a side table we have. It will go over the base and go around in circles and can’t get out again. It also likes to vacuum over the base of our floor lamps and my standing desk legs and my desk chair legs then gets stuck between the chair wheels or gets lost.

I try to schedule for a time I’m going to be away because it also takes about 2 hours to clean my 900 sqft apartment (because it gets stuck or turned around a lot) and it’s very loud with the wheels hitting things. Just need to make sure to pick up any cords or cat toys etc before leaving.

From what I can tell the matrix version uses a different system entirely instead of a single camera eye looking at the ceiling. If you can afford the upgrade I’d recommend the matrix version - it may not have as much clearance to go under stuff but it’s probably better at navigating spaces and won’t need as much supervision.

———
Highly recommend following the directions and cleaning it regularly.

If any of the filters get too dusty it doesn’t work as well. (Which may be common sense but easy to forget when it has the canister)

Sometimes it will try to empty a few times because the back doesn’t line up perfectly. That’s because either the base moved a bit or it can’t get enough suction to empty into the canister. Easy to take apart and clean if that happens and also easy to troubleshoot in general.

Mapping on the app is “just ok” but that’s the norm for an older model."
3,"German Shepherd, 1: Shark, 0","We recently tore out our carpet and replaced it with vinyl because the carpet had so much embedded dog hair, even with using a Dyson Pet vacuum on a regular basis. With the new floor, it seemed like a great time to get a Shark so it could run daily just to keep up with the hair. The Shark will run for about 30 minutes then will give a ""error 2"" indicating an obstruction. The Shark will roll up hair so tightly that it just jams up in the roller. After pulling it out, it will run again. It does go back to the dock periodically to evacuate the collected dirt. But then I also noticed that even after evacuation, the unit seemed to just run over dirt and small particles and leave it behind. I pulled the bin out of the unit to see what was happening. Just after the evacuation process, the photo shows what is happening... the dirt bin is jammed with dog hair and the evacuation process doesn't get rid of it. So, of course, not much is going to get vacuumed up. I tried running the unit on the maximum power setting to see if it would handle the hair better. Nope. That's why we call our dog a ""German Shedder"". On another note, the unit still seems to be struggling with developing a decent map. There is one bedroom that the unit has only found once in multiple cleanings. It's curious how the unit will go back and forth over an open area, and miss an entire stripe. Sometimes, in the middle of going back and forth in a large open are, the unit will seem to pause and then head off in a random direction before finishing and never come back. I see that other buyers say that it takes 50 or more cleanings to get the map right.. so I will keep trying.
THREE MONTHS LATER: In the last few weeks, the unit has had new issues. The unit will do a half-baked cleaning, and then return to base with still 50-60% charge left. It will sit there for a random number of hours and then take off. When it takes off, it just does a random walk from room to room sometimes just going to a room, spinning circles and doing random motions before going to the next room. I called tech support. They said they would install new firmware. No change. They had me remove the pause and recharge setting. Now, it no longer randomly takes off. It does periodically leave its base for a few feet and then return. But now, when it does a cleaning, it cleans first and then proceeds to randomly wander around from room to room, it spins and really never follows a pattern in each room. It continues until the battery dies. Called tech support. They started to ask me questions like who is my ISP, what brand of router do I have, where am I located. Well, I'm no tech genius but I can see that they are just wasting time to get past the warranty period. They seem to call me every couple of days and leave a voice mail. The caller speaks very softly and seems to have a heavy foreign accent, so I have no idea what they want. I have tried calling back and just end up on hold. So the unit may work for some people, but mine does not and support is not very good.
ANOTHER UPDATE NOV 2020: After multiple phone calls and e-mails, I finally found somebody that decided that multiple drive wheel errors was an actual concern. They asked that I pay $25 shipping to send me a new core. I would have to switch out the wearing parts from my old unit. Then.. radio silence for days. Finally, I get a shipping notice and an e-mail saying that my credit card had been rejected. But then they tell me that they will waive the fee. (BTW, my credit card is fine.. not sure why it rejected). Things are getting better. Then, on the arrival date, I discovered a TOTALLY NEW complete system had been sent with no request to send back the old unit. The new unit is great. It cleans in a logical manner, it doesn't do random stuff, and I have had zero errors over the last 3 cleanings. Better yet, the map is looking good whereas the old unit never could seem to come up with a map. So, I increased my rating from a 1 star to a 3 star... 5 stars for a great unit and good customer service... averaged with 1 star for the 3 months of abysmal support."
3,A little underwhelmed with its performance,"If your floors are already pretty clean, then you'll like this robot just fine. If you have pets who shed and kids who drop food everywhere, particularly along walls for some reason, you probably won't be impressed. I have a long-haired cat who is shedding his undercoat right now and the robot really struggles to pick up the clumps on carpet. I would pick up the clump and drop it in front of the robot, but that didn't work. I have to go in behind it with a stick vacuum. Despite having two little edge brushes, it's horrible at picking things up along walls, so I have to use my stick vac again. It also gets stuck on my bathroom mats. I had an iRobot back in the day, and it had a feature where it would sense dirtier areas and spot clean them more thoroughly automatically. I wish this robot had that feature. The other thing I don't like is that you can't program it to clean specific rooms at specific times. The only option is to program the robot to clean all the mapped areas at a specific time, which also means you can't use the matrix clean feature. I like the matrix clean feature, but you can only use it if you clean one room at a time or spot clean a small area.

Don't get me wrong. I don't regret this purchase and I am glad I have it because my house still gets vacuumed more than it would if I didn't have it, but there's room for improvement. I love that it self empties. It's pretty easy to empty the bin (although there's no way that bin can hold 60 days worth of dirt) and untangle the brushes. I like that it makes a map of your home and you can create different rooms, but I wish you could remap specific rooms instead of having to remap your entire house or even delete things from the map. My cats must have been playing chicken with it while it was mapping my home because there are two, small, random spots on the map that the robot avoids. It's pretty quiet except when it's emptying its contents, but even that's not too bad."
3,Works well but has flaws,"This review will based on my experiences with the robot vacuum compared to my Roomba i7+.

I had the roomba i7+ with the self emptying feature for 6 years and loved it but it was falking apart and needed an upgrade. I had been researching this product for a while before purchasing and was satisfied until I started using it. We have 4 dogs and daily vacuuming is necessary in our home.

1. The mapping run was quick and accurate after only 30 minutes where my Roomba would take multiple runs to finish. However, the map was awkward to setup. I have 3000sqft home with several rooms. Some of the areas are smaller than others which requires tailoring of the map. The map will only allow rectangular or square shapes and have a minimum size requirement. This didn't work for our setup. The Roomba would allow me to make odd shapes to fir my layout and mapping desires.

2. The biggest selling point for me was the bag less self emptying feature. The roomba has bags in the tower that holds contents after clean out. This one does not.

3. My biggest gripe with this vacuum is the dust bin on the vacuum does not have full bin sensors where the roomba does. Why is this an issue? Well, like I said, 4 dogs and 3000sqft. This robot only empties every 30 mins. With our dogs and home size, this doesn't work. After the bin is full, the robot continues on its way for 30 minutes. This causes the dog hair to be compacted into the brush roll and port of the dust bin reducing its cleaning abilities. I was constantly having to empty the bin manually, remove clogs, and clean the brush roller.

4. For the good parts. The robot cleans very well until the bin is full. The Li-Dar mapping is fast and accurate. The variable suction power is an amazing feature. Setting up cleaning runs is fast and intuitive. The overall app experience is good, as well. Cleaning are much faster and more effective than the Roomba, until the bin is full. The Mayrix clean feature is awesome for high traffic areas.

Overall, this vacuum is great but there are some features that I was looking for that weren't apparently missing untilbi started using it.

Hope this reviews helps to answer questions for others that I was searching for and couldn't find!"
3,Price is right for a self emptying robotic vacuum cleaner but needs improvements,"First the cons and pros:

Pros:
1. Bagless self emptying base. No repeat customer for life proprietary bags that cost $$$. Easy to empty.

2. Mapping technology that over time makes a virtual map of your house so that you may send your vacuum to certain rooms or areas. (Yet to be tested. Still waiting on my vacuum to build a map. Instructions say it can take more than 10+ full runs depending on size of home)

3. Brushless tangle free brush. Even though it says it is tangle fee, hair is still building up in the main brush and will require maintenance every so often but nothing compared to my Chinese knock off brand vacuum that would need cleaning constantly. It's definitely an improvement over traditional older type brushes. But at what cost? I am not convinced that the brushless brush is as effective because I am noticing hair that it misses on the floor. Time will tell.

4. It plays jingle's when connecting and disconnecting from the base.

Cons:

1. Virtual map doesn't support virtual boundaries. You have to use the boundary tape that comes with it in order to prevent the Shark from cleaning places you don't want it too. I am not sure why this can't be added to the current mapping technology. I have not tested the boundary tape yet.

2. Probably the most annoying and easiest problem to fix. Vacuum always vacuums at medium power. If you want it to vacuum at max power you have to select this manually every time the Shark starts a new run. A design flaw? Lazy coding? My cheapo Chinese knock off vacuum allowed this no problem but not a Shark branded vacuum? Very odd.

3. First initial wifi setup gave me problems. While following the Android on screen prompts on the Shark app the vacuum kept losing connection and requiring me to start the process over. After about the 5th attempt and rebooting the vacuum several times did it finally work randomly.

4. When the Shark becomes stuck or I have to pause it temporarily, I'll then resume it using the physical clean button on the vacuum and it'll sometimes not respond to the button press. I have to press the dock button and that'll get it moving again. It's odd.

5. So far one time I found the Shark vacuum in an endless loop of trying to clean or maneuver over a hose on the ground that was part of a handheld rug cleaner. I heard it in the background making the same noise. Upon my inspection I saw the Shark run over the hose, back up, and run over the hose again in a continuous never ending loop. It was almost like it was trying to kill my rug cleaner on purpose. I've seen this happen with inexpensive robotic vacuums where they get stuck and perform the same steps in a continuous loop until it runs out of power. This tells me there isn't a fail safe within the code that if the vacuum performs the same steps over and over that it should try something different. This concerns me because this can end up ruining rugs and carpet and possibly other things if it's wheels keep running back and forth in the same spot.

Details:
This was an upgrade, at least I like to think it was an upgrade, from a Chinese knock off brand named Xiaomi Robot Vacuum Cleaner. Main reason for the upgrade was because I needed the self emptying base so I didn't have to empty the vacuum cleaner every day. It also has the added bonus of being bagless so you aren't a repeat client for life buying proprietary bags like the Roombas. Also the tangle free brush so I don't have to cut through hair and clean the brush weekly. This vacuum seemed to fit the bill.

The first 5-10 times the vacuum cleaner wouldn't make it back to its base to empty or to charge. It would hug the wall as it would try to retrace it's steps to get back to the base station. Ultimately it would fail, get lost and run out of battery power. However I guess it started to map my house out over time and it got smarter and eventually started to make its way back to the docking station with more precision.

Overall time will tell if this robotic vacuum cleaner is worth the money. It was priced right for me but it may not be priced right for everyone."
3,"I love the robot, but the robot doesn't love hair!","We purchased the Shark AI Robot Vacuum with Matrix Clean Navigation soon after we had LVP installed in our entire house. Loved it! For the first 40 days, I couldn't believe I had ever lived without one. However, somewhere after 40 days it gave us an error that the roller brush was stuck. I followed the directions to see what had happened and discovered mountains of hair was stuck in the roller and had even clogged one side of the roller preventing it from moving. I did my best to cut all the hair, but it never worked again. I called Shark customer service and they were great. They agreed that it shouldn't stop working after 40 days, especially because of hair clogging the roller, and they sent us a new robot. With our Shark upright vacuum, we could go 4+ months before I had to cut hair out of the roller. Now after every clean I cut hair out of the roller, making sure that the one end of the roller does not get clogged again. If I didn't have to do this after every clean, I would give the robot vacuum 5 stars, This is honestly my only complaint about it. And if Shark could figure out how to make a robot vacuum where hair didn't clogged up and stop the roller, I would buy it in a heart beat."
3,Flawed Features,"We had previously purchased a Shark RV1001AE, which is a nice vacuum but had a huge flaw. With the upward-facing camera, it could not detect our 108lb dog's occasional accidents in the house.

While this only happens once or twice a year, when it does the Shark RV1001AE would just plow through the soup-can-sized pile or poop and smear it all over the house. This then turns relaxation time after work into an evening of cleaning carpets and other surfaces where transfer occurred. This also means we spend our weekend disassembling the vacuum and deep cleaning all the parts.

The hope and promise with the LIDAR vacuum, was this would be the end of these incidents. Unfortunately, that is not the case. After owning the vacuum for several months, we came home and found that the same incident had occurred. The vacuum failed to detect a large chunky pile of poop from our dog who may have gotten a little constipated and didn't get it all out during her morning outing.

The vacuum proceeded to do the same thing as the Shark RV1001AE and plowed through the pile, smearing it all over our rugs. Once again, we'll be spending several hours this weekend disassembling our vacuum and doing a deep clean.

While the increased capacity on this device is nice (nowhere near the promised storage capacity if you have pets who moderately shed), it's not worth upgrading to this model if you're trying to avoid the incident I described.

The vacuum does seem to do a better job of cleaning low-ply carpets and wood floors, it is much louder than the Shark RV1001AE. It also makes lots of clicking and clunking noises, which makes me wonder if the thing is defective sometimes, but otherwise, it works fine for doing what it does when there aren't obstacles on the floor that can cause a mess.

Another warning for buyers is to be aware of any furniture that has sloped feet or low and flat feet. This unit and the Shark RV1001AE have chewed up the finish on our coffee table. They ride right up and over the curved surface and scratch up the finish. We have bookshelves, desks, cat towers, and dog blankets where these same sorts of incidents occur. It's not uncommon to find both of our vacuums stuck on top of a pile of dog blankets our dog has dragged out onto the floor.

For multi-pet households, this vacuum is great for keeping on top of the shedding, but it requires absolute vigilance to make sure your pets are regular when you leave for the day. If not, then even on our schedule of running the vacuum just after we leave for work, you may come home to find your evening ruined and your Saturday occupied with frustrating robot disassembly accompanied by scrapping poop out of cracks and crevices with rubbing alcohol and cotton swabs.

A final note, if you have large pets and you decide to get one of these vacuums, owning a good carpet shampooer is essential. The amount of coverage on our throw rugs would have been catastrophic had we not had a shampooer that could clean it up immediately. Do yourself a favor and prepare for the inevitable. No pet is perfect, and the occasional accident is bound to occur, and this vacuum isn’t capable of avoiding pet accidents."
3,I wish I could return it. Its waste of money,"Well, apparently is not easy to use at all. Recently it wont even vacuum anymore after 4 months of having it. It runs for 5 minutes and goes 5 ft and then returns and calls it finished. No errors, no nothing. If you think the app is useful for troubleshooting, you are wrong. If you think the website is useful, you are wrong. If you think you can find a real model number to search it, you are wrong. But I gotta give it to it, its quiet,, until it needs to empty the robot. It keeps locking itself in rooms, keeps getting itself stuck in weird places, and keeps not telling me about it you til I go home and realize its not in the dock.

Update: ive deleted the map, cleaned everything, re did the whole setup, but now it tries to explore for 10 ft and returns to dock. Honestly I really wish I could return it and buy something else. Its a big waste of 400 bucks. Id rather burn $400 than buy this"
3,Lost Internet Connection,"When I first got it, it linked seamlessly with the internet. I loved the way that it cleaned! Then I had a power outage and the internet connection was lost. I spent hours on my knees trying to reestablish the connection. I tried all the suggestions on the Shark website, I googled it and tried their suggestions without success. I finally called customer service, only to be told the problem was on their end and they would email me when it was resolved. It’s been several weeks and nothing yet"
3,Frustrating!,"Love this vacuum for its ability to clean, but it has a tendency to forget where it's been or where it's supposed to go next. Today it cleaned the master bedroom twice, the bathroom and hall twice and ignored the other two bedroom. After wandering back into the living area it finally remembered the other rooms and returned to clean them. Then it's clean the hall again and back to the kitchen and around to the living area. I finally just told it to return to the dock where it then announced that the job was complete. The map showed that it ran for about 45 minutes and cleaned 1/2 the house when in actuality it ran for over 90 minutes and cleaned some areas twice. It appears that once it cleaned some areas twice it assumed that it was through and after remembering the missed rooms simply began over again and erased from memory what had already been cleaned. Would never trust it to clean while I'm asleep or not at home. It has to be constantly monitored for these glitches. That being said, it is super quiet except when emptying and does a decent job cleaning the floors. But there's definitely no schedule and forget option, which is what I was hoping for."
3,Wanted to give 3 1/2 stars,"I’ve been using this Shark robotic vacuum for about eight months now. So I want to give an honest review. Wanted to give it about 3 1/2 stars, but since that’s not an option, I downgraded to three stars because didn’t really feel like it was worth 4 stars.

Pros: Easy to set up. Love that you can program to clean on a regular bases or designate various rooms to be cleaned. Love the self emptying dustbin and this is the reason I purchased this vacuum.

Cons: It says it’s good with pet hair. It’s really not. Maybe with very short pet hair. I have a mini aussie and it doesn’t do a good job. It does get some of it, but some of it that it picks up it also smears across rugs. Also, the roller brush smaller than previous brand robotic vacuum, I’ve used so it takes many more laps to clean the same area as my former brand and thus much longer.

Conclusion: When I need a new robotic vacuum, I will try to find the things that I like about this Shark vacuum in my former Neato brand."
3,Mobile app has qualified dev?,"For this kind of coin there should be some quality control. I cannot get the app to stay functional.
I spend more time getting the app to work than if I just manually vacuumed myself.
I read some of the privacy statement and found they are selling your meta data. This thing will suck up more than just the dust from your floor! I killed the app and internet connection. I just let it learn the floor plan for the first time every time and it's just takes a little longer but it can't phone home anymore.

Not sure why they say Voice Control, there is no voice anything anywhere on this product. Shady behavior and shady advertising. Buyer beware!"
3,"Good for surface level cleaning, not great for baseboards...","We received this vacuum as a wedding gift and were extremely excited about it because we have two longer haired dogs (Australian Shepherds). First a foremost, the vacuum does a great job at surface level cleaning on a day-to-day basis. We have ""Bruce"" run throughout our house every-day to help mitigate the never-ending shedding of our dogs and it's very nice to have most of the surfaces free of dog hair. The vacuum doesn't do a great job on our rugs (which are relatively low pile) beyond a light cleaning (even on the maximum suction power). We largely expected this type of operation, so we still use a normal vacuum around the house roughly every 3-5 days to keep things cleaner. The original roller that came with the vacuum routinely got hair caught up in it; however, we ordered a replacement set with a ""hair cutting"" feature from another brand that significantly improved the maintenance intervals required. I strongly recommend cleaning out both the vacuum and base filters (metal, cloth, and foam) at least monthly to keep suction operating well.

Now for the not-so-good: This thing isn't as ""smart"" as advertised. You'd think by doing multiple mapping runs of a relatively small floor plan, the vacuum would be able to figure out where the walls are and plan accordingly - NOPE. Our vacuum basically operates by smashing itself into every possible baseboard/wall to blindly find its way around the house. As shown in the pictures, this has taken a toll on our baseboards. After reaching out to Shark for clarification on how this is supposed to operate, they basically gave me the run-around multiple times claiming that the ""mapping"" wasn't done correctly (it's re-mapped our floor plan 3 times). I've basically given up at this point and put felt pads around the vacuum to help protect our furniture and walls.

Overall, it does a fine job, but once this one craps out on us, we're going to upgrade to a higher tiered model that uses lidar for better mapping."
3,It’s just ok,"I replaced a cheaper Roomba robot vac with this one. I have a Shark vacuum cleaner that I love so thought I’d try this robot out. First, I love the automatic emptying feature and it’s quieter than my Roomba was but that’s pretty much where the likes end.

I set up the map of my house, and it was pretty easy. However it doesn’t always clean the complete area. It misses a lot of the areas it’s set up to clean. Where it does clean it does a good job. The main things I do not like is at least 1-2 times a week it disconnects from WiFi. I have to completely delete the robot, and redo everything, maps, renaming etc. it’s very frustrating. The Roomba was much easier to reconnect if it did disconnect from WiFi (which only happened once in a year when our internet went down). The app is not helpful with troubleshooting either.

I’m contacting Shark about possible solutions or returning it for another one as this may just be I got a “lemon”."
3,Lasted 1.5 years. Works well with maintaining fur.,"I really liked this vacuum. I feel like the first year it worked well (purchased October 2022, stopped working June 2024) and I noticed that maybe over the last six months or so it seemed to be struggling more and more. The arm brushed kept breaking and falling off. It would have difficulty with other things like the suction being clogged. Kind of small things when dealing with a 120lb Great Pyrenees dog and a small cat. Pet fur everywhere at my house. But just this week it stopped working. It says the brush roll is stuck. I have cleaned it up as much as I can and I don't see any reason for it to be stuck. I think it has just given out. My favorite thing about this vacuum was that I didn't really have to think about it as it is self emptying. I will say my least favorite is that it still bumped into walls and got stuck in certain places, so while It was smarter than others I've had, it still struggled a bit. I'm bummed that it's not working and considering buying another of the same kind. I wish the arm brushed would stop breaking, so maybe that's reason enough to look into others first."
3,Works 75% of the time,"Purchased this vacuum in November 2022. It’s now June 2024 and I’m ready to replace it. The dust roll gets stuck a lot which is annoying because it will not continue and you have to search for the vacuum in the house. We have a dog and a cat so the vacuum is often put to work. As time goes by, even with routine cleaning and upkeep, the vacuum never seems to work at its full potential. The primary issue with it beyond all of that is that it refuses to vacuum unless it’s at at least 70%. Our house square footage is less than 1200 ft.² on one floor so it does about half of the house before it stops and recharges, even though the recharge and feature is turned off. the dustbin application is easy enough to maneuver, but getting the vacuum to shoot the dust into the dust Mann is always hit or miss causing You have to manually remove dust from the dust trap on the vacuum when it’s already docked. The Wi-Fi range on it is quite good however. And when it does work, it works really well. It’s just getting the actual items to work. Also, the warranty is basically nonexistent because the shark app does not seem to be compatible with this particular robot. The map feature is really nice but the integration with Alexa is not there yet. For instance, if I tell Alexa to ask to vacuum the kitchen, she will just trigger to clean the entire house rather than one specific area."
3,Good idea - but it has given us many problems.,"Often sends us notifications, asking us to remove hair or dust clots from this or that wheel or roller brush. The sensors also sometimes become dusty within a week or two, and do not work, correctly. Thus, the robot vacuum numbs into the walls or objects like a piano stool multiple times (6-8) before going around it and moving on.

I’m not saying it should be pristine in movability - I understand this technology is a little fresh. They really need to work on the A.I. algorithms, though. When it is working, it does a decent job picking up hair and dust that is in the middle or toward the edges of the halls and our home’s 5-room floors. I had to use our manual Dyson to get the dust and hair at the edge of the hallway.

I do like that the Robot Vac finds its way under beds and sofas, which we rarely do. Thanks!"
3,"Patience rewarded, but","Update 3 (Feb 2021): I've had my Shark for over a year, and my satisfaction has dropped. The first issue is that no matter what rooms I tell it to clean, it always cleans the room where it docks. Second: the map tends to disappear. I'll admit I don't use it as often as I expected (see next issue). The last issue is that I'm disappointed in its ability to pick up ""small"" stuff. For example, at Christmas I decorate with fake snow, and small amounts end up on the rug. The Shark tends to pick them up and drop them elsewhere during its trip. Likewise with tiny scraps of paper. So I have to pick up after it finishes. I don't recommend it any more.

Update 2: I’m in day 7, and I’ve upgraded my review to a 4, based on the mapping capabilities. I was able to name all of my rooms (not so easy) and schedule cleaning of specific rooms (also some issues if you have a long list of rooms). The vacuum cleaned the specified rooms quite thoroughly and returned to its base. It’s really expert at finding its base now. I expect this will be my last update unless there is a new surprise.

Update 1: It's a couple of days later, and my vacuum thinks it has mapped the whole place. The map is kind of sketchy, but it does show all of my rooms. So I gave a few of the rooms names. Not a particularly intuitive process. Then I told the vacuum to clean the kitchen. It proceeded to start cleaning the office, where the dock lives. So I need to work harder on getting it to clean the selected rooms. Meanwhile, it has a couple of notable behaviors. Sometime it comes back to its dock, empties itself, then leaves. Sometimes it stays, even though the whole place hasn't been done. Twice it has lost the wifi signal, and the solution seems to be to delete it from the app, then re-add it. Using the same name to add it back in seems to retain the map. I'm very impressed with its behavior when it gets into a tight place. It rotates, tries another direction, then repeats. Sometime it stops completely for a few seconds before setting out in a new direction. Sometimes it stops and turns in the middle of an open area where there isn't and never was an obstacle.

Original: I really want to like this item, but the first few days have been a bit frustrating. We have a fairly large area with a complex floor plan, and the Shark IQ works best when it has completely mapped the area. After that, I can name the rooms and tell it what room to clean. I think it will take a session about 5 hours long to map the entire place, and I honestly don't want to leave it alone yet. Since I haven't had a 5-hour window yet, I've had to stop it , and with each restart it follows the same path as before. So the room where its dock lives is VERY clean.
By comparison to my Dyson vacuum, the Shark is very quiet when cleaning my carpeting and not super loud on the hard floors. I'm thinking that I'll still need to use the Dyson occasionally for deep cleaning, as the Shark does a good job with surface debris like crumbs, but only disturbs the top surface of the carpet.
I'd like to suggest some features that could be helpful, such as showing the current location of the vacuum on my phone as it is working, even on an incomplete map. If I could also use my finger to guide it, I think I could accelerate the mapping process.
Once my map is complete, I'll update this review."
3,"Love it, but broke in first 60 days!","I’m not much of a review guy, but after getting off the phone with support (International with a bit of a language barrier and about a 1.5 second lag in connection), I had to write a review. The robot itself is fantastic. I love the app, I love the noise level, I love the value. However, we’re very disappointed that I got an error message of my front bumper being jammed. After a full troubleshooting process, the robot needs to be replaced. Shark is charging me about $11, for shipping of the replacement drone body. I need to remove the brushes and the battery from the old drone, and put it into the new one. Also they were unable to supply the same color robot, white, in a timely fashion. I would’ve had to wait 30+ days to get a white robot replaced. Disappointed, because I really loved the performance of this drone thus far."
3,Vino fallada la descarga,"El producto parece muy bueno, sin embargo, vino fallada la descarga hacia el contenedor. La primera vez que se puso en funcionamiento hizo mucho ruido y salía olor a quemado. Es como si tuviera una pieza rota adentro que impide que se vacíe. Luego de forzar un ventilador indica ""Error 26"". Como vivo en Argentina, no pude hacer el cambio, porque me salía más caro en envío para la devolución que el producto en sí. Una pena, porque la función principal por la que la compré, que es la descarga, no funciona."
3,Almost 5 stars...except,"This product would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact it won't work in the dark and the software is terrible. Why couldn't Shark add LED's pointed up to the ceiling for its navigation camera?!?! Infrared LED's would take little power and add almost nothing to the cost of this already expensive product, you wouldn't even notice they are on, IR is invisible to the human eye, security cameras have been using them for decades. NO, I have to turn on lights in EVERY room in my house wasting electricity and if I don't the vacuum can't navigate.
The software is terrible, the vacuum gets stuck on nothing for no reason I can understand even with the lights on. Because of this the battery voltage drops so low it destroys the cells and now I need to order a replacement battery. The app keeps logging me out and my iPhone's autofill is incompatible with the Shark App so I have to manually re-enter the password just to use the vacuum.
I went to the Shark website, went through ALL the steps I was supposed to and it still didn't work so I called tech support and they asked if I had done all the steps that I had already done and wasted my time. Then they transferred me form department to department to department to department.... putting me through phone tree purgatory until they hung up on me. I called them back but their system hung up on me again even though I was very polite the whole time.
In my opinion, Shark is a morally bankrupt company. This vac has the potential to be very environmentally friendly because it uses so little electric power to run when compared to a standard vac but because you are forced have to turn on lights in every room for no good reason they are costing the world many KWh's of electricity and tones of polluting CO2 into the air for no good reason. In my opinion it's because they would rather force you to dispose of your ""old"" Shark vac to sell you an upgrade.
Other than this the hardware design and build quality is FANTASTIC, It's so good I bought 5 of them!!! The vac reliably returns to its docking station and empties itself, this is a very challenging engineering problem. Congratulations to the engineering team at Shark!!!! Well done!!! Since I’m an engineer I can easily add my own IR LED’s and I can cheaply make my own replacement battery packs or even double their capacity. I know Shark will eventually fix the software an then I will have a 5 star product but sadly, no one else will."
3,Good light cleaning- battery life not so great,This is good for light daily cleaning of my rugs. The battery life of this Shark robot is far inferior to the 2 other shark robot vacuums I have.
3,Wouldn’t buy it again without some changes,"The vacuum itself is great. I love the self-emptying, and it does a great job on hard floors and short rugs. It does an okay job on carpet with pet hair, but that’s to be expected. What I really don’t like about the vacuum is 2 things:

1: It doesn’t dodge ANYTHING. It’s supposed to be great at detecting obstacles but it absolutely does not, so if we do ever have pet messes or stuff laying around, it’ll just run right over it and potentially get stuck or dirty.
2: There is no option for it to automatically run on the “matrix clean” setting (or the grid-like setting where it has a specific pattern to follow to make sure every inch is covered). I can send it to do the matrix clean for each individual room (literally one room at a time which is annoying) but I can’t schedule or send it to matrix clean the entire house. When it’s on an automatic schedule, or even if I just hit the “clean” button to have it go through the entire house, it has no specific pattern. It’ll miss entire sections of multiple rooms. I was gone for a week on vacation and had it set to vacuum every single day. I came back to dirt in random places all throughout the house because it just totally missed some sections. I spent good money on this so this is very frustrating. I’ve been using it for multiple months now trying to figure out if I’m missing something, but I think that’s just how it’s set up. I hope that Shark adjusts their software to allow for an entire home matrix cleaning option."
3,Suctions isn’t as good as the roomba but no bags,"Suction isn’t as good as my son’s Roomba his gets up the Florida sand- my shark doesn’t pick up coffee grounds;(. But I don’t have a bag and I have a bunch of replaceable parts which hopefully means I can fix it if it stops working like my old roomba did.
update: one month 16days it’s in a circle spiral;( apparently you have to pay for repairs and replacement parts even under warranty. I didn’t this time and they are sending me a new shell because of the main hub wheel not having a path;( I guess I get to transfer all the removable parts to the “new” vacuum and begin again. I’m worried I should have gotten the roomba- hopefully I won’t to update bad again."
3,"Great vacuum, horrible seller","Vacuum is Great! This is more on the Seller. AP Deals NJ. We paid an extra 40$ to get the shipping expedited from the original delivery date. Not only was it massively delayed, but it took well over the original delivery date without the extra paid to expedite. When reaching out to them for a refund, they finally shipped it. Then it was stuck for over a week in some facility. When reaching out to them they refuse to respond to provide a solution. Our request was simple…we wanted a refund for the extra shipping that wasn’t provided is all.

Update- Amazon made it right and issued a full refund for me. Thank you Amazon for standing behind your customers!"
3,"This thing sucks, both good and bad","My experience was not as great as the majority of other reviews. The This is my 3rd robo-vac. My house is 2,400 sq. ft, 1 level with LVP flooring a few area rugs, a lab, and a couple of cats. The first was an early iteration of Roomba. This would just knock about until the battery died, and then you got to play find the robot. The 2nd robot was a Wyze. This had lidar mapping and did a fairly reasonable job. But could not complete the house in one charge. This lasted about year then the suction really started to fall off.

Enter the Shark. After reading reviews, gave it a try. Easy to set up. Basic app functionality. Stongth suction. Great battery life. At first I was impressed with the cleaning ability of this vacuum. I did want a little more control in the app. That said, the mapping just did not work great. After a dozen uses, there were still unmapped areas of the house. In addition, the holding bin was so small, I could only do two or three rooms (depending on size) before it would need to return to empty.

Perhaps my house is just a little too large or my expectations were a little too high, but this was not the vacuum for us.

So I'm in the process of returning it. I did pick up a Roborock Q7 Pro Max + from Amazon Warehouse and so far, really impressed. I'll write a reivew on that after it has more floor time."
3,😑 meh.,"If you have a small space to clean…super! If it doesn’t have different rooms to go to. When it’s vacuuming the right spaces it does a great job.
I bought this for my ranch style house. I was so excited. However the room mapping doesn’t work after a bit. It is like a rebellious child…doing it’s own thing. Today for instance; I sent it to clean the family room before company came, but it decided to go instead to the dining room, which didn’t need vacuuming. Then headed back for the dock and said it was done. Other times it will decide instead the whole house needs cleaning but only do half of some rooms and move on. Or if I select the whole house, it will only clean a couple rooms somewhat and be done after a couple recharged. So I find myself more and more often having to pull out the vacuum and do the job myself. Pretty frustrating!

I would not choose this particular robot vacuum again as happy as I was with it when we first got it. Sadly, it quickly changed my vote. Glad I waited a few months to review.

Note: my sister who lives out of state also has this vacuum. I spoke to her sure when I started having issues, sure I was doing something wrong…she shared she’s looking to replace hers because she has dealt with the same thing. She has multiple ones on each floor; but only one Shark and won’t be getting another. Buyer beware"
3,I was hoping for a miracle,"We have two golden retrievers, so dog hair is EVERYWHERE. I was hoping the Shark AI Ultra would help keep our floors clean of golden dust bunnies. When it works, it works well, but so far, it's been disappointing and I'm not sure it's worth the money, although I plan to keep it.
It's probably just me, not doing something right, but whenever the vacuum gets hung up for whatever reason (the side brushes get tangled in the fringe of our Oriental rugs, it gets hung up on a dog toy, or for some other reason), I clean out all the filters, clean the roller bar, and press the button to start cleaning. However, I have yet to be successful in getting it to start cleaning again. So I just carry it back to its dock and wait for the next time it goes out to vacuum.
It mapped our house after just one run through.
I have the app on my phone, but it absolutely drives me crazy that every time I turn on the app, I have to wait for the stupid Shark icon/vacuum in the app to make 3 ""cleaning"" passes on my phone screen before I can even get to a screen to change the vacuum schedule, find out why the vacuum is hung up, or anything else.
Because we have so much dog hair, the vacuum has to go back to its home dock quite often to empty its filters (which aren't very big). I don't mind emptying the filter basket in the docking port (it beats vacuuming). But I don't think the vacuum has deep suction."
3,"Very NOISY, not good on rugs, stuck on thresholds","Play Video
Review after one full emptying cycle (took about an hour). I live in a 1910 open floor plan unit with the old 3/4"" wood thresholds, and a mix of varnished floors, rugs, and area carpets. I had tried a Tikom robot vacuum from Amazon, and it got systematically stuck on the thresholds; this Shark does a bit better but still has difficulty.
This Shark is VERY NOISY, more so than my handheld Miele vacuum. It also does NOT CLEAN RUGS well and unlike the Timko, it does not increase suction on rugs. It does a good job on area carpets though. Another difference is that the brushes on the Timko have three arms, whereas the Shark has only one each, and this significantly reduces its pick-up ability. It's also a tad higher so that it doesn't fit under the center part of my couch, which causes it to be disoriented. Though it tries to follow regular lines, it often seems to do bonkers and spin on itself without purpose. On the rugs, I've also noticed that is bounces randomly...serious!
I'll give it a couple more days and maybe revise this review but it's most likely returning to Amazon.
NOTE that I bought this Amazon-refurbished unit, which may explain that it's not performing as well as it should (I've had a couple prior problems with Amazon refurbished items)."
3,"""Incorrect password"" error after one month","I got this as a family present for Christmas this year. Set up was easy and mapping was thorough. However, almost a month to the day, the unit stopped connecting to wifi. When I tried to connect the wifi I would get to the connection stage. The app would confirm connection but the wifi kept flashing on the robot unit and ultimately would give an ""incorrect password"" error message. The password was not wrong. I tired every fix on the Shark website including deleting the robot, restoring factory settings and starting over. I also tried every other fix I could find on the internet. I checked my wifi router and service. Nothing wrong there.

I called customer service and every time I got about a minute into the call and the call dropped. After 5 attempts, I tried to get onto the chat support on the Shark website. I sat on that waiting for an agent for an hour. Given other reviews that indicated this was an unfixable problem, I decided to return the unit, rather than continue being frustrated by a semi sentient appliance.

Up until the wifi error, we were delighted with how this robot performed, cleaning up most messes. It did struggle with pine needles in our front rug. But it could crawl around chair legs, etc. The mapping went swimmingly on our second attempt.

Despite all of this, without wifi, the unit was inoperable."
3,🤣🤣🤣 not as advertised,"This thing looses its way at least once a week, has no idea what a no go zone is and starts randomly no matter what the schedule is programmed for, customer support is a joke and the problems start right at or right after the warranty is up please don’t waste your money"
3,It doesn’t recognize doggie doo,"I was so excited to finally buy my Shark! It was cool how it mapped itself out and even told me when something was amiss.
I’m relaxing reading a book because now I have extra time( vacuum is taking care of itself.) all of a sudden I get an awful whiff of dog poop. Needless to say my pup had an accident and good old sharks decided to carry it all over the house. Unfortunately I didn’t realize this error being on the other side of the house enjoying my book.
I threw away my area rug that was custom cut and bound for the specific area and spent probably 2 hours trying to get the poop out of the wheels and brushes. Do you know how many grooves are on a shark vacuum wheel? I do now.
So, if you have puppies or animals that have occasional accidents, I do not recommend this product. If you’re animal free, it’s a great product. You just have to rescue it from behind the toilet every now and again."
3,"Good Features, but Lacks in Performance","While this robot vacuum has some impressive features, like voice control, home mapping, and a self-emptying base, I found the overall performance to be underwhelming. The Matrix Clean Navigation does a decent job on hard floors, but on carpets, it often misses spots and struggles with deeper cleaning.

The 60-day capacity and self-emptying feature are convenient, especially for pet owners, but I expected a bit more efficiency in terms of navigation and thoroughness. It’s a good vacuum for light, everyday cleaning, but it falls short when dealing with more demanding tasks like pet hair or deep carpet cleaning."
3,"Loved this but after 9 months, charging station won't charge past 5%","I bought this for myself for Christmas in Dec 2023 and I really enjoyed it! Unfortunately, after about 9 months the charging station stopped charging past 5% so it no longer works. It is a bummer since I have always had great luck with Shark products."
3,It’s great when it wants to work,"I bought this in December ‘23 and it was working fine however as of late I feel like I maintenance it more than it actually does its job. The vacuum likes to randomly work and function properly and then other times it sits in the dock with the red information light that can mean a million different things. (The manual doesn’t tell you anything useful on what this particular light means and you’ll have to go on Google). I take it apart and clean it (however there isn’t much to clean), I reboot the robot, I restart my router, I make sure there’s nothing in the actual dock itself that may be causing trouble to no avail. It’s like the vacuum has a mind of its own and chooses (sometimes the most inconvenient time) when to work if it feels like it. The product is quite pricey for it to function this way and I’m at a loss on what to do at this point.

When it works it’s amazing at picking up annoying crumbs that get on the floor and vacuums up the carpeted areas very well. When I use an actual vacuum on my cleaning day I hardly pick up anything. That’s how well this robot vacuum works and helps."
3,Shark vacuum Will not pair with internet,"This product claims to be schedulable, activate me from phone, makes reports of cleaning, and other app driven capacity. But it will not pair with modern internet - like xfinity Gateway’s that toggle back and forth between 2.4 and 5 ghz channels. And when you call Shark for support - their higher order service reps who supposedly help customers will not talk to you unless you have 2.4 ghz internet channel. I will use it without pairing, but none of the characteristics related to the app will be usable. Very disappointing."
3,My order gives one model number and bottom of the robot gives a different one,"I have had this since January of this year so I would like to order some replacement parts, especially the side brush. I don't understand why my order identifies this model as RV1001AE IQ but on the bottom of the robot it says RV1502ZXUS. I can' find a replacement brush for either of those models when I search. I initially ordered a replacement kit that said it fit RV1001 AE but when I got it, the brushes were wrong and the roller brush was wrong because it was too tight and wouldn't spin."
3,Not as good as advertised.,"Once you get the vac online with your phone, get it to map your floors, and you pick up any small items, the vacuum can work on a set schedule. It does not have a wide swath, and although the two front brushes sweep, they miss tufts of cat hair and the like. You'll need to clean the vacuum brush and dirt trap every week. You MUST have access to an air compressor to blow out dust from the inside of the vac and its filter."
3,"Good hardware, poor software","Used it for two and a half months on hardwood floor in my house.
Having robot emptying itself on docking station is a great idea. It eliminates the necessity of the frequent removing / cleaning the dust filter inside and it was the main reason I picked up this particular model.
Cleaning quality is good, no dust or dog's hair after robot completes the job. Spinning brush underneath works great with practically no hair wrapped around. Middle wheel seizes pretty often and needs frequent cleaning to remove wrapped hair. Not horrible but manufacturer could have foreseen an obvious problem that was very easy to avoid with minor change in wheel's design.
Robot can't climb over my door step (less than 1/2"" high) and I had to take it off. Big disadvantage to me.
Navigation algorithm of the robot is poor but still does the job of cleaning and returning back to the docking station. After 2 months and about 25 cleanings, the house map is not even close to the actual layout of the rooms. It seems to me that with map deleted (I did it couple times), robot makes more passes and eventually cleans better than with meaningless map it has now.
Smartphone application is very poor. Can bet it was done in India. It loses the password all the time and asks to enter the password every week or even twice a week. Really annoying. When I do an online banking, I type my login and password every time I need to get access to my bank. Makes a lot of sense. When application forces me to enter the password nearly every time I want to use the vacuum cleaner (that robot actually is), it looks stupid. Dear software guys who designed this: security stuff is a good thing but if you can't make security code working properly, do not do it at all. I'm not worried too much about international hackers hacking my vacuum cleaner to clean my house for me.
I used to take off all chairs and dog toys from the floor before starting the cleanup but there is no way to figure out when the job is actually done. Robot will return to the docking station when it finished cleaning. It will go and sit there when it just decided to recharge. When robot returns to recharge, the ""Clean"" button in application is enabled. Any reasonable person will believe that since he can start new clean, the previous one is definitely over. He is wrong! In couple hours robot will complete recharging and start moving again after you already put everything back on the floor or open the door where you don't want it to go or closed the door where you want it to clean or turn light off. Happened to me not once and very inconvenient.
There are many other issues with the smartphone application. I mentioned just two of most annoying. Full impression is that the software was done in the rush, without any plan and was never properly tested. It is pity that good and capable device (robot itself) is in hands and under control of such a poor manager (software). Happens in real life too :).
Overall, robot does the good cleaning job and has a potential to become a really great product if manufacturer fixes multiple issues with the software."
3,It can’t figure out how to go back to the dock.,"I just got this vacuum a few days ago and I only tried it today. After it mapped the floor and charged itself in the dock, I started to have it clean. After cleaning I noticed that it is taking a long time to get back to the dock. It took almost 15 minutes for the vacuum to keep coming back and forth in the dock and not being able to go back. I had to put it back my self.

I have also noticed that it is a lot louder than other robot vacuums and it keeps giving me an error that it’s wheel is stuck.

I am not sure how it avoids the objects because i saw it keeps bumping on our floor lamp and is trying to climb it at some point."
3,Worked great for a year,"We loved this vacuum at first but after 18 months or so it seems to be getting dumber.
It won't map the whole house anymore, it just maps the room the base is in and quits. It can't seem to find the base and often runs out of battery looking for it. It ignores the ""No Go"" zones completely and frequently detects ""cliffs"" that don't exist.

I doubt I'll be wasting money on another robot vacuum again."
3,Problems with scheduling and app,"Though the vacuum does a reasonable job in navigating and going over transitions from hard floor to rug, and an ok job picking up dirt, there are problems with the scheduling. It doesn’t seem to know what time it is, so if you schedule it to run at 1:00am, it will run at 2:05am. Why? Also, the app is poorly done and the help instructions in the app don’t match the app. Very disappointing!"
3,"Ok, but not great for pets","Definitely not as good as advertised for pets. I have do double coated dogs who shed a lot and this thing barely picks up hair from my rug and often gets lots of fur tangled up in the brush. Disappointed as that's the main reason I got it, but the suction just doesn't seem strong enough for heavy shedders.

If I didn't have the dogs, I would probably otherwise be happy with it."
3,Hard to clear hair from roller,"I wasn't impressed with the mapping software. You set it to explore and it does a vague map. When it cleans a few times, it learns your floor plan better. But the vacuum still tries to go down my stairwell. Magnetic strips don't stop it. I tried to use the ""no go"" lines, but they are large boxes, not lines.

The vacuum does pick up long hair. But it's not sucking the hair until the dust bin! Instead the hairs get wound around the brush roll ends. My other robot vacuums do the same. BUT the Shark vacuum roller has a small ""lip"" in orange in the picture. This keeps the hair on the roller and makes it practically impossible to remove the hair from the roller. : ( At least my Roomba i7 is incredibly easy to remove the hair!

But my favorite vacuum is my Neato D7. It picks up the most hair and dust. It's mapping software is great. The no-go lines are very precise. But sadly, 3 out of 3 vacuum have ended up spinning in circles due to a faulty wheel mechanism. : ("
3,"Decent, but Needs Improvements","I have now had this machine for just about a year.
First the positives: This machine is REALLY good for pet hair. I have a husky and during the heavy shedding seasons, it does a great job no doubt. Occasionally this does get tangled, but it's an easy fix. I also love the lack of work required when it comes to cleaning the machine, as the bin is a massive help.

However, there are negatives. First, the IQ part is questionable. I often find the machine going back and forth over the same spot or area and completely missing other areas (even after it docks and gets sent out again). Therefore, I have to usually do 2 runs every time I clean (which amounts to like 3 release and dock cycles). In keeping with this, there is no remote or app control to move the machine yourself. Others at a much lower rate have this option (a type of joy-stick). This really is a big negative when it comes to cleaning up the small spots or areas the machine missed/ areas you want to focus.

The cliff sensor is great, but the machine has no ability to climb over thresholds that even slightly resemble a bump. For this, I have to always get up and move the machine with my foot over the doorway and will have to do this for each door. I end up doing a lot of the work to keep it running. Once or even randomly is not a big issue, but when it's an everyday occurrence it becomes a problem.

The machine itself is not terribly loud when running, as you can control the suction between eco, normal, and max. The loudness really comes into play when docking. Since it has a bin that cuts out the work of releasing the dust it collects, the downfall is the suction is enormously loud. It's probably equivalent to a gas-leaf blower at 6 am in the morning. Granted this only lasts for about 20 seconds, but boy it's loud. However, that's the payoff to not having to clean it yourself. So I won't really call this a negative... just something to be aware of.

Lastly, the mapping is not very accurate. It helps, but I don't really think it does too much in the long run, because the vacuum is always missing an area or 2.

In short, it's a good vacuum - great for pet hair - but I do believe there are now better vacuums available for purchase with most or more of the perks. Namely, the ability to control where it goes would be a massive help."
3,Awesome if you don't have multiple pets.,"I purchased this new July 5, 2024 and I can honestly say if I did NOT have pets I would probably love it.

I have 3 rescue dogs and an ancient cat so keeping my hardwood floors hair free is a major, constant, challenge. From all the wonderful reviews I read I was hoping that this vacuum could handle a daily sweep of the main areas of my home but the poor thing just can't handle it. I'm freeing the stuck roller and unclogging the robot at least every other week.

If I DIDN'T have pets though, I would LOVE this product! It really would do an excellent job for the average home."
3,"Manuals are useless, support can be found. Be","It's a long setup but, one can get the Shark IQ to perform as advertised. I found the manuals to be worthless, and I have dedicated 26 years of my employment experience to selling, installing and instructing folks on foreign made electronics. So, heaven help the rest of you! All documentation states that the robo exhibits ""random cleaning patterns"". Well, there are random and there are ridiculous. I finally gave up and called Shark Support. Per the norm, the front line of that support was more interested in gathering my personal information, for spam, than in answering my questions. My one story townhouse is around 1,860 sq ft. The unit would clean my Great Room, over and over for more than an hour, return home and shut down for the day. My chances of getting anything else cleaned, much less a map of the rest of the house, were slim to none. My second Support Contact (yes, humans do ultimately answer the phone) advised that my townhouse square footage was too close to the max battery life and that I would have to purchase a second unit. WELL, that's not going to happen! I had read that there was a ""recharge and continue"" cleaning feature....the toggle just wasn't where the manuals said it should be. Besides, the instructions were to turn it off - that just didn't sound right. My third support contact agreed to have a Tech Specialist call me, within 72 hours. In the meantime, I found the ""recharge and continue"" toggle in the settings drop down menu, under my robo's name, in yet another sub drop down. I turned it On (duh). In the same area there is a ""do not disturb toggle"". I recommend that you turn it on and set up some human sleep hours so that the robo doesn't ""recharge and continue"" all night long. It's motor is quiet, it's bumping into walls and furniture is not. Besides, it announces itself, with a trumpet alert, when it leaves and returns to it's dock. (So proud!) The Shark Robo now ran until the battery was low (15%) then returned home, recharged and continued. But, it never produced an accurate map and tended to roam the rooms with no rhyme or reason. The Tech Support did call me within the 72 hour window and advised that the software had to be updated. I had to leave the robo, on its home base, for 48 hours for the update to be performed. It took four more cleaning runs to produce a satisfactory map. Robo and Owner are now happy, communicating and meeting specs. I'll be throwing out the shipping cartons rather than returning the robo. Hang in there, you too can get the Shark Robo cleaning your home - as advertised."
3,Loud (60dB); Fouls up regularly.,"Play Video
Goal: I finally bit the bullet and bought this to help vacuum because I can't physically do it all.

Plan: Pick up at night before bed, run routine vacuum schedule at night.

Pros:
-It picks up its fair share of dirt.
-Always finds dock easily.
-Text alerts let me know when it's stuck (and it's always stuck).
Cons:
-It's LOUD. 60dB. No squeaking to indicate bad belts or bearings, no debris or grime, barely 6 months old, has been run fewer than 10 times.
-Sounds like a helicopter. Clunks when switching from rug to floor, and back to rug. Kerchunks when it runs into a chair leg.
-It finds *something* to suck up and get stuck in its wheels or rollers with every run.
-Despite having the two-month version I have to empty the bin every 2 runs, and that's with a regular weekly pass over the floors with a Dyson. The bin isn't full when I'm notified that it needs to be emptied."
3,"Great at first, Regret setting in","I've had this robot for almost a year. I have two cats and a lot of carpet, so I was hoping to reduce the amount of time I spent manually sucking up cat hair.

This robot was great for a while. The initial mapping was extremely tedious and the map itself is less than stellar, but that was easy to get over. It swept up a lot of hair out of the carpets and my apartment had never looked better.

Ive now begun to regret shelling out so much money on this thing. I absolutely cannot run this robot without an error. It constantly acts like it is stuck, even after meticulously cleaning out the roller. It tells me that the dustbin is not installed, when it is. Most recently, it is getting stuck in the dock when initializing a clean cycle, forcing me to manually pick the device up, place it back in the dock, and re-attempt the clean cycle. This totally defeats the purpose of having a 'smart' robot vacuum since it requires non-stop human interference to do the most basic of jobs.

I've also had to replace the battery since purchase. Shark's support isn't necessarily the easiest to use or navigate.

All in all, perhaps this device is great for some users, but I sorely regret not saving my money and purchasing a different unit instead."
3,Cleaning and mapping,"Hi, this is our first robot vac. We are impressed on the mapping and cleaning. I didn’t think that it was worth buying a bot , but wow it really does help. Well apart from that the self empty it works great every time it docks. Now for the bad . The setup is easy, yet using a new iPhone 12 for whatever reason I couldn’t read the instructions all the words were in top of one another , still managed to set it up. Also After mapping the house . I wanted to save the map but the instructions said to let it run for 10 runs , well on the 6 run I decided to save the map and was happy in doing so , until I labeled the rooms , wow at first - very nice labels the , kitchen, living, dining, foyer and hallway. That’s all and pressing the save button, it all went crazy. So I deleted that map. Now after each run it still does and goes where it needs to , but it’s not showing a map. I guess I have to let a few more runs even though I’m on the 10th. I do recommend this robot vac. The noise levels are lower and cleans very well and perhaps better than some of the other models that I have heard or seen. The WiFi connects at times but it’s kind of far so I’m ordering a WiFi booster from Amazon and seeing if that will take care of the problem. I’m just hoping the map appears again and this time no labeling LOL , I’m just saving it and leaving it alone. The Scheduling would , or should work but again the WiFi is weak near the docking location. I would rate this a five stars if the schedule, WiFi and mapping Cooperates LOL but again perhaps it’s the WiFi . So before I contact support, I’m boosting the WiFi signal. I’ll up date this review if I remember or have time. LOL
Yes I did look at lots of review on YouTube and some of the problems they are facing are not the problem I saw. Oh this item brought some type of Magnetic strip for boundary , but I just close the doors to the bedrooms, bathrooms and garage. Just doing so the little robot leaned or is leaning to keep away from those areas. Even though I have kept those door closed During the cleaning. I will test the robot with the doors open after a get the map setup. I can’t think of anything else for now to share and besides this is way to much information. My bad . I’m Just telling the truth."
3,Solo funciona con APP y no está disponible en Colombia,"Este dispositivo solo funciona con APP y en COLOMBIA por ejemplo no está disponible, habría que verificar en qué otros países tiene disponibilidad la APP.
Solo funciona para la gente que viva en casa de un piso o un apto, porque solo te mapea una zona, es decir si quieres tener un mapa de un segundo piso y de un primero no se puede. Solo puede haber un mapa y no lo puedes parar para añadir otra zona por ejemplo.
Su diseño es muy bonito y tiene buena succión en su limpieza."
3,Not ready for prime time,"I'll preface this review by saying that I have been using a Roomba 550 for many years and pretty much know what to expect out of that older model. Almost our entire house is hard surface flooring of different types with some area rugs. It's a ranch of approximately 1800 sqft and we close off two of the bedrooms which we clean manually. We've been using the shark for about 4 months.

This shark does not come close to doing as good of a job cleaning as the old Roomba. We always find dust bunnies, birdseed, and other debris left behind on the floor. We run it on the normal mode and it really seems to be lacking suction. If you put it on the high mode it won't make it through the whole house without killing the battery. The edge cleaning is poor, with a lot of debris being left around the edges of rooms. Roomba uses an oscillating motion to clean along edges. Shark just drives along near the edge at full speed. I think that may be the reason for the difference in edge cleaning ability.

The mapping really just doesn't work. I've just deleted the third map. It has never offered the map option for cleaning a specific room even though it has said the mapping was complete. It has randomly stopped cleaning specific rooms.

The auto empty feature works reasonably well though there is always pet hair trapped in the filter that you have to clean out manually. That partially defeats the purpose though it will go back and empty and continue cleaning so it can do the whole house with no intervention.

PROS:
Self empty allows it to cover a large area.
Definitely quieter than the Roomba on normal mode.
Cheaper than Roomba.

CONS:
Mediocre cleaning.
Mapping doesn't work.
Doesn't necessarily clean the whole house.

I know somebody who has one of the cheap Chinese brands that costs around $250 on Amazon. That one also appears to do a much better job than the shark in terms of completely cleaning the areas and leaving virtually nothing behind. Those are not self emptying which is a drawback.

At this point I'm thinking that I'm going to be replacing this with the Roomba that is self emptying. I'll probably use this shark to vacuum my workshop where it really doesn't have to do a perfect job."
3,"Good cleaning, unintelligently","We bought this on Black Friday and I was very positive and excited about it. It's been a little over a month, and so far it has performed just ok - I'm somewhere between a 2 and 3 stars on it. The problem is, I don't know where it's going to clean when I send it out - regardless of what I tell it. And it does clean well, but there are areas which it cannot get - pine needles on the 3-4"" strip of floor between the edge of the rug and the sofa legs for example.

Pros:
- It does clean pretty well, and it's fairly durable/well made. I haven't had parts fall of it, or anything break yet.
- The self-empty bin is a wonderful feature and very easy to empty.
- I like the 3 options for cleaning level.

Cons:
- The mapping software is lousy, imho.
You can only draw squares/rectangles to define rooms, no complex shapes, and their minimum size is limited which makes drawing the map difficult.
I have 6 rooms defined, and if I select 1 or 2 rooms only, it usually just does the living room - even if I haven't selected that one to clean, and then it returns to base.
Sometimes it will do the living room plus the whole house, and sometimes half the living room plus the 1 or 2 rooms I selected.
It's really unreliable in this way, which is very frustrating.
- It doesn't seem to pay much attention to the prevention strips either.
- The app has quite a bit of latency issues, which is odd considering I only access it once or twice a week."
3,Vacuums the house like a teenager,"******Update*****
I contacted Shark we did some diagnostic checks. We updated the firm ware. After all that the vacuum was working but would not leave the dock when I assigned it to clean an individual room. The warrantied the vacuum and shipped me a new updated model which is working great.

I’ve had this thing 4 months. Instructions are Cliff Notes on operations. I haven’t had it vacuum every room. Once the battery hits 50% it goes for a recharge. Will waste battery just crisscross the house. There is a support tab in the app but this model is not listed. A model with a close MN says something about setting for battery level but I don’t see that.
In the “besides that Mrs. Lincoln how was the show “category the vacuum does a decent job in the areas of the house it goes. The room where the base is I’ll gets the best vacuum. Sometimes it does the other rooms. Hit and miss if the living room and kitchen both get done. 4-bedroom 2 bath 2000 square feet under air. I have a choice to use this vacuum ending in a partially vacuumed house in 6 hours or just do it myself to have the house fully vacuumed and mopped in an hour.
No reply from the seller or manufacturer."
3,Works nice but,"I had been looking to replace the older irobot that I had and this one came on sell. It looked like it would be great, self empting, floor mapping, continue were it left off, good for houses with dogs.
And that is the only problem I have with it. It fills up the collection bin alot faster than 60 days and will get plugged and not be able to empty itself. Leave clops of hair as it keeps trying to continue vacuuming."
3,What a Disaster,"We purchased this item for use at our winter home. Two adults no kids or pets. Right off the bat the mapping functions was hit or miss. Finally got the map to work but the vacuum never seemed to follow the ma. Calls to customer service were an adventure. First of all the CS is located in Columbia and unless you speak Spanish communicaton is a challenge.Each time you call you must recite the long serial number, the lengthy model number and the lengthy identifcation number. When all three are on the agents computer they never the less put you through this. The numbers are on underside of the vacuum and reading them can be a challenge. What are they afraid off? In total my four calls to CS were only temporary solutions. In the end the vacuum would launch on schedule, come out its dock , vacuum for a minute of two and return to the dock. A retry would result in the vacuum doing one room and returning to the dock. Ultimately I decided if this device required that much CS in the first month of ownership it needed to go back to AZ. In the end wonky software and awkward CS forced the return."
3,"Works, Kind of","Bought this primarily to clean laminate flooring -- especially scattered litter from my cats. It is OK for cleaning small bits, but for larger piles it just spreads it around. The major issues and the fact that I downgraded it is after 8 months the wifi connection failed so I can no longer use the phone app. I can still vacuum by pushing the clean button on the robot itself. Hopefully that will last awhile."
3,Too aggressive.,"I have a roomba 980 that has been working well for my family for about 1.5 years. We wanted a second robot vacuum and decided to give this Shark IQ 101AE a shot given the price point and feature list. The basic design of the robot and self empty bin look solid. The problem I have is with the way the robot performs. Where my roomba 980 will slow down and bump into obstacles gently, the shark IQ robot bumps into objects often at full speed. Sometimes, the shark robot doubles down and keeps trying to bump into objects with too much force. While cleaning, the shark IQ robot will even bump into it's own dock and displace the dock so much that the robot can't dock later. What really sealed the deal for us was that the shark robot was jittery when turning around on hard wood floors. The motion was so spastic that the wheels were leaving rubber marks on our floors. Maybe shark could make a few hardware and software tweaks to fix these issues. I would recommend avoiding this model unless you want your house scuffed up.

Positive observations:
The self emptying feature is brilliant
The brush doesn't tangle with hair
The robot is very quiet on carpet
The robot does pick up dirt and debris well

Negative observations:
the robot leaves scuffs on dark hardwood floors
the robot bumps into furniture aggressively
the robot disrupts it's own charging base
the robot's brush is loud on hard floors
the app crashes frequently"
3,Ninja Shark Robot Vaccuum,"At first it worked good- the map it made of the house was completely wrong, but by the second attempt it was correct! That said, it takes a few minutes of ""prep"" work to get the house situated for the vacuum- picking up small objects, sweeping up big objects, even moving some furniture so it can navigate easier.

Also, warning: if you have a motion sensor alarm on high sensitivity, there is a possibility that it can bump against a chair or curtain and set it off. That's happened to me a couple of times so now I just only run it when I'm home.

About the first month I realized, even if I directed it to a particular room- the robot went wherever. So that was disappointing because some areas need sweeping more than others. Eventually, the ability to choose the rooms on the map went away- of course AFTER the return period had lapsed for me. I had figured they were updating the app so that the robot could follow directions on cleaning specified rooms, but that wasn't the case.

I'm also a little confused on which filters need to be updated. It just says, to replace filters go to our website. But it seems some can be washed and reused but others are one-time use only, so that's probably user confusion on my part.

I got this on sale but now feel I overpaid since I can't select the rooms. As I said above, that option had not yet been disabled while I was still able to return it. Otherwise, I would have gotten a refund and considered a different model. Overall, I do still use it but it would be better if I could select rooms instead of pressing a button and hoping it eventually makes its way there before needing a recharge while not knowing how long it will take to be finished."
3,Works with some problems…,"The vac works fairly well. However, it does strange things. For example, after vacuuming a room, when the robot is heading to the dock, it will make a detour and run around in circles in another room but without the suction on.

The most annoying thing, which makes me not want to use it, is the loud squeaking noise that started after about 3 months of use. It is intermittent and very, very loud and annoying. I have cleaned and lubed everything with a dry, Teflon lube… yet the noise continues. I bought on sale for $330 and feel like I overpaid given the excessive noise.

Anybody have a solution for the squeaks and squeals?"
3,Not very smart,"Works great in rooms with limited furniture and absolutely nothing on the floor. Otherwise, be prepared for it to need attention multiple times per run. It also loves to spend lots of time focused on areas where’s its more complex (side table legs) and limited time on the nice wide open floor that matters most. Will look for something smarter next time I purchase."
3,"Over promised, under delivered","My LG G8X Android phone wouldn't connect the robot to our Wi-Fi, but my wife's iPhone connected it with no problem. I like the navigation system better than a bump-and-run iRobot vacuum, but it takes several runs to build a somewhat usable map. It always finds its way back to the dock and never gets stuck. The empty and resume and charge and resume works, except it doesn't pick up where it left off. For a 2700 square foot house it should be emptied after each use. The ""self-cleaning"" brush roll may be better than a bristle only brush roll, but it still needs regular detangling. Labeling the map is difficult, because the map is small and tedious to work with, there aren't enough room names, custom names are not allowed and no-go zones require unsightly magnetic strips. Directing it to clean just one room is not effective. It does a pretty good job of vacuuming our hardwood, tile and low pile rugs, but occasionally misses spots. The new lidar navigation model sounds promising, but if they don't execute on their promises better than they did with this IQ robot, I'd wait for someone else to do their product testing besides me.

Edit: Support for the Shark IQ XL self emptying robot seems to have been dropped in favor of the new Shark AI Robot. The IQ mapping capabilities were never adequately upgraded to allow proper labeling to send the robot to a specific room. The robot has to be reconnected to Wi-Fi virtually every time and cleaning the whole house is the only option. The option to clean an individual room only showed up once and never again. The robot does a fairly decent job of vacuuming, but never has lived up to any of the advertised claims. As stated in the title, over-promised, under-delivered.
Update: The Sep2022 app update deleted room names, deleted & disabled history & moved the dock location on the map. After labeling the rooms the robot now wanders more aimlessly and has a more difficult time finding its way to the dock.
Update Jan 2024: It NEVER cleans individually selected rooms."
3,Great vacuum but lousy mapping system,"Best of the Best but also Worst of the Worst
This I Shark vacuum does a great job picking up. I give 5 stars on the cleaning. BUT it does so much that it should not do. I have had this vacuum since November 2020, and I am writing this review May 2021, and have not yet got it to clean my whole house. I have to run it when I am at home because it will climb up on everything. Much of my furniture have cabriole legs and this little fellow climbs on all of them and cannot get off. So I have to be around to get it off the chair or table legs. Next it goes over the same area several times and run out of energy before it gets all over the house. Then several hours recharging.
It gets lost from the base and run completely out of energy. I have a small room about 8ft. x 10ft. And it will clean the middle of the floor. Goes around and around the edges but never across the middle of the floor. The map hasn't gotten complete yet in half of a year. It also bumps into the walls and furniture rather aggressive.
I really like the way it picks up and the carpet looks great when it finishes, but it may use half of the energy cleaning one large room.
I am going to have to buy another robot vacuum, but I will not buy this one again because it is too much trouble to make it clean where it should in a respectable time. I really like the self empty feature. This vacuum needs a better GPS system. Maybe if my chair and table legs were straight it would do better. It also does not resume where it left off,it goes right back over where has been. I am saddened that the fellow makes me get my upright push vacuum in order to get my whole house cleaned. When I get home from work I don't feel like rescuing a vacuum every 15 minutes. So I can say that this a very good very bad vacuum cleaner.

3,"Great when it is great, still not 100% perfect!","I love the app feature, and the overall general performance of this robot! I will say, i have two doggos and they shed A LOT. Their hair does sometimes get wrapped up on the brush, but it was easily be cleared away. ALSO… i know we all dread this thought, but my robot “brucey” has gone through poop twice! first time wasn’t nearly as bad as the most recent. I WISH i took pictures lmao, the thing smeared poo ALLLLLL over my living room rug that is light grey and white. took quite some scrubbing, but i cleaned it up. I have yet to clean bruce, as he himself is quite a challenge to clean😫😭😭"
3,"It cleans what it wants to, adding an important comment at the bottom of this review","I thought this would be a helper, but after running it on 3 different occasions, I am leaning toward returning it within the 30-day grace period.
We have a complicated house, with MANY obstacles. The first time I ran the robot I actually picked up the cat toys, moved the chairs and cleaned up BEFORE cleaning up - very ridiculous - like washing the dishes before putting them into the dishwasher. So I left cats toys etc. It is powerful enough to move water bowls, but it does not vacuum litter on the carpet or even litter on the wooden floor. It does not particularly like carpet fringe. If it does not choke on it and cause an error, it LEAVES a large hairball behind. I have watched it swishing a tiny branch aside and driving over litter crumbs as though they did not exist. I have picked up several hard hairballs which it created, but left behind. At first I thought: ok, let it just clean on the open floor, avoiding chair legs, cat beds, etc, but it does not even do that very well. Today it kept going over the same areas several times - mostly hard wood floor, did not clean very well and then docked itself, quitting for the day.
I guess that our house is just too complicated for a simple machine.
Writing this review convinced myself that I can do better and faster with my built-in vacuum.
I am disappointed, because for years I have worked up to the decision to try it.
IMPORTANT CHANGE OF MIND HERE:
After actually printing the return label I wanted to clean it for the return.
I had read in the instructions that there is a small compartment in the robot which needs periodic emptying. It should be STRESSED in the instructions that this compartment should be emptied after EACH CLEANING, especially if you have a carpet which sheds.
That small compartment was CAKED with carpet crud. After emptying it I ran the robot again: NOT BAD!! Then I opened that front slide-out container: it was full again with carpet shed. It does not get vacuumed into the big debris container.
I am giving the robot another chance."
3,"After 6 months, it's ok","I wanted to give this a fair review. I have had it since January. The app is great. Overall it works. It just doesn't pick up everything from the floors. It's struggles to pick small things like litter on hard floors up, even in matrix clean mode. But it does ok. Running daily it makes my home look ok. Carpet it's not great at all. The other downside is, it is very loud. Infant older versions are much quieter, (my brother owns and older model and it cleans better and it quiet). There are better products. This wasn't cheap. It's just ... ok. I don't think it's worth the cost."
3,Not for operating in the dark,"Been wanting this vs the Romba brand that’s 1k for a good while but $$$. I have done so much research on these that I overlooked the most important feature that would have to have for my situation... let me start, this bot adds up to be better than the Romba brand via lots of YouTube and forums (do your own research). I got this for my dojo as time is priceless, I can have this thing clean my entire dojo and I would always have a clean floor for my students. The remote feature... what remote? I can’t manually drive this thing to a spot. Guess that’s what the mapping feature is great? Y’all tell me... so my dojo is completely dark, no windows and guess what, this bot does not function properly in the dark because it’s sensors do not pick up anything and it cannot map (makes sense). (Well J why not turn on the lights? Because I don’t want to make a special trip to turn on the lights and leave on my days off, gas and mileage)... I have a chunk of cash sittin in my dojo floor. I feel my review will only be for a certain amount of people and that is fine, you know know about the dark functionality. But the hair does not seem to get caught in the main brushes so that’s a plus. I don’t have to service this bot as much by cleaning the brushes. I will keep it as a lesson learned and find out a way to clean when I am there in the light some how. Also it seems to get lost in the dark and I often find it in the middle of the floor dead. I have 2 oscillating fans and this bot climbs up their base like a tree then sends me a message on my phone telling me “something ain’t right” it got off balance and terminates the cleaning. It got itself in the mess it needs to get out. So if you have a high rug it should climb up a half inch raise and continue up the 20% grade haha. I still like this bot it’s just when picking it out I forgot it would need to work in the dark. I’ve had two off brands by the same company of a different bot that worked great but they both died via mother board. Then got one from Home Depot and it’s not as great but it does more in the dark then the Shark in the dark. So if your running it in the dark make sure it’s in a well lit area!"
3,"I got it half price, no suction power","I previously had a eufy that suction power was amazing, I have three dogs so I had to empty everday. This one had the bin and was half price so I bought it, not even half the suction, only reason I kept it I have a hardwood floor loft Ill put it in"
3,Came in dirty,"Not sure how the product works, but mine came in the mail dirty and used."
3,We tried both the shark and i7,"We tried both, the shark iq and the i7. Here is our thoughts:
The Shark, we like the bag less bin. It cleans just fine on hardwood and rugs. Battery life is not so great it takes two or three recharges to clean the whole house 2000 sf. The app is lacking. Right after creating our account it said we had the wrong password. We ran the shark 50 times and it never created a complete map of our house, the app said 34% complete. We deleted the map and started over, 40 cleanings and again we were at 34%. Also without the map the shark continuously pushed Christmas gifts around and got stuck on our tree skirt. We could have used the black tape to block it from our tree but that seemed to be a waste for only three weeks and an eyesore. The shark never seemed to know where it was and it had a hard time getting back home and regularly ran out of battery before making home to charge. Also this caused it to take more time to clean and probably contributed to it taking two to three times to clean the house.
The i7, the bags are very easy to replace but we liked the bag less better. It Created a map of our house in 8 cleanings and we were able to pick which rooms to clean as needed and on a schedule. We have it set to clean main walking areas daily and other rooms split throughout the week. The map was important this time of year. With the i7 we could draw an area around our Christmas tree and it would avoid it. We can also block off areas like under our entertainment center where there are a lot of cords. The i7s battery lasts much longer and with us able to pick which rooms to clean it completes each scheduled cleaning on one charge in less than an hour. The i7 clean more accurately, meaning it would go straight to where we told it to clean and clean In straight lines and get back home. The shark always seem lost and wasted time and battery trying to navigate.
Several time we would send both the shark and i7 home and the i7 would go straight back while the shark had a hard time.
Over all we really wanted the shark but the mapping feature is just not where it should be.
The mapping features of the i7 makes the i7 a better fit for us."
3,"It works well, but minor updates could make it great.","I'm very picky and seldom give great reviews, so I would say 3 stars is a good rating.

Overall I'm happy with this product, and would recommend it.

It could probably be more powerful, but I'd probably say that about any robot vacuum... Typical ""Tim Taylor"" here

I have three minor complaints, which I don't believe to be reasons to not purchase this product. But maybe it's good to put them out there so others can make more well informed decisions when purchasing.

1. By default the vacuum operates on normal power and I haven't found a way to change the default mode to high power (or Eco if desired). To change the mode I have to manually change it when it starts cleaning.

2. The battery doesn't last too long. I have a pretty small house (800sq/ft) and I've blocked the vacuum from cleaning 2 of the rooms. It cannot finish it's task on one charge, the battery takes a while to charge also... So not a big deal, it just surprised me a little.

3. Overall the robot is pretty darn smart, I love the straight lines it makes. What I found to be hilarious is what it does after making all these nice, orderly, straight lines; When it goes to the next room or back to the dock, it just blows right through the middle of all of the lines lol. Again, it's not a reason to not purchase this product, but you'd think they would have the program stay close to walls when transitioning rooms or going back to the dock. **My mom was a cleaning lady and she would make a point to vacuum last and in a way that she could leave the job with no foot prints left behind, as if to say the house just cleaned itself. It wouldn't take much for the robot vacuum to have the same effect."
3,Not as good as my old Roomba,"I've been using this vacuum for the last 6 months hoping everyday that it would miraculously get as good at cleaning as my old Roomba. But no... The old Roomba was a tank and could navigate any terrain. But the shark hits the thresholds and limps away. Roomba was starving all the time and
would pick up all the crumbs along the kitchen baseboard but the shark has no appetite and the crumbs just accumulate until I sweep. The best thing about the shark is that it tranfers it's dust bin to the base. And it never seems to get full because it doesn't pick up as much. So I just forget about it until I notice the crumbs, check the app, and find another notification that something got stuck in the bin door and it hasn't vacuumed for the last 5 days or so. That's the other thing I miss about my old Roomba , no app (no settings, so nagging notifications) just plug it in, set the schedule and let it go. And it always went. And it always picked up everything...until the day it didn't. Nothing compares to your first love I guess."
3,Not perfect but pretty darn good.,"If you think this is the ""be all, end all, do all"" vacuum, this isn't it. I've owned 4 different robot vacuums, and they all seem to have similar problems, this one just has fewer faults than some of the others. Like other vacuums, it gets ""stuck"" when crossing over wires or a table leg (one of the supports sits horizontally on the floor). It also gets jammed up with debris (dead leaves from a house plant, for example). It SAYS it's WiFi and will ""remember"" where to dock but you can't tell by me. If I give it an order to return to the dock, it frequently takes 20 minutes or so, bouncing off the walls like it's lost. It will eventually get there (usually) but I honestly don't know how useful the WiFi is. And if you think you can go for 30 days without emptying it...fuhgettaboutit. Not only do you have to empty it 'fairly frequently' (every couple of days or so) but you have to actually REACH INTO THE UNIT to manually dislodge the pet hair (by grabbing it with your fingers) because the hair accumulates around the cone-shaped air filter at the top, inside of the collection bin. In other words, you have to TOUCH the hair, grab it with your fingers and pull it out of the unit. Ugh. And on another yucky note: I definitely would NOT recommend buying any robot vacuum if you have pets who poop in the house. When a robot vacuum runs over a mess...well, use your imagination. Plus, it takes you about an hour - wearing plastic gloves - to completely disassemble, clean, and sanitize the unit. It's not pretty (voice of experience here). However, the fact that it does return to the dock with a good deal more accuracy than other robots is a plus. And the iPhone app lets you know if it gets stalled while you are away from home (which is kind of useless, since there's nothing you can do about it until you get home.) If you've never owned a robot vacuum, this is the best one I've found. It definitely keeps the pet hair ""tumbleweeds"" cleaned up, in a very noticeable way. It completely eliminates them. No dusty corners, either! If you hate sweeping as much as I do, you'll appreciate the fact that your floors are noticeably cleaner. (I only have one small dog and one cat, but you would not believe how much hair they shed!!) All in all, it's a good unit."
3,"Good suction, ""voice control"" is a stretch, overall not very smart","Lidar built in allows for precise mapping and vacuuming. Happy with the suction and cleaning quality, ability to select specific rooms or spot clean via the app. Manual cleaning via app is the only real description I would see accurate for this device. The remaining feature claims are stretches at best and misleading at worst.

Clean base: poor job evacuating debris. Clogs often. Vacuum constantly displaying ""dust bin not installed"" error.

App provides little convenience, scheduling or lifestyle adjustments that competitors provide at even lower price points. Voice control claim is a big, big stretch. The only function available via voice is vacuum or stop vacuuming. Cannot verbally request a specific room be cleaned.

The scheduling function is one I can't figure why Shark even bothered with. You can only schedule to run the vacuum once per day, and only to clean the entire map. Can't schedule specific high traffic rooms for regular cleaning. Pointless.

In six months owning this, the app has already lost my map once which is a huge disappointment."
3,Doesn’t dock,For The last week I have come home from work with the vacuum near the dock but not docked. I am not sure why but this isn’t docking when done like it is supposed to.
3,Didn’t last long,Worked decent for 9 months. Clogged up every other day. Developed a bad side sweeper. No replacement parts available. Real pain to get to what should be replaceable parts. $400 brick at this point.
3,"my son loves his, but I could not make mine map my house","I bought this based on the fact that my son and daughter-in-law bought this one and really love it. It mapped out their house quickly and works great. However, for my house, I could never make it map the kitchen area. I would force it to go in there, thinking that once it knew the area was there it would map it out. I deleted the old map, I tried everything. My son was even trying, we watched youtube videos on what to do, we tried everything. It also never fully mapped out my bedrooms. If I could have had another month to try to get it to map out the house, I would have kept it and kept trying, but you have 30 days only. I spent a LOT Of time trying to get it to map the house. Much more time than it would have taken to just sweep the house myself. I removed all the furniture I could and raced ahead of it moving stuff so that it would map the entire room, and that helped for the mapping it did, but it never did finish and never mapped into the kitchen area. I really wanted to be able to tell it to go clean the kitchen, but you can't designate rooms until it fully maps the house. So this is a mixed review. My son loves his, it does a great job in their house with 4 cats and a dog, but for me ,it didn't work out. I would suggest that if you do get one, that you try to remove as much furniture from the rooms at first ( I didn't do it until later) so that it maps the entire room right away. I did love the auto-emptying and it did that, as well as self-docking very well."
3,Super mid,"Have a different robot for all 3 floors of my house. Roborock on the 2nd floor, irobot on the first, this one in the basement. Basement is by far the easiest floor. No rooms, all wide open and this gets stuck constantly, ignores the no go zones, and has the worst scheduling system. It cleans well, but not better than the other major brands. Would not recommend, would buy a roborock if you're looking for the best, irobot if you're on a budget."
3,Does NOT pick up dog hair from labradors - otherwise a nice vacuum,"picked up loose hair that had not been stepped on yet only first 5 minutes. No suction apparent - just like a broom. rolled over everything else. after five minutes it started dropping clumps and ""twists"" of hair it had previously picked up. When I opened the round vac's tiny box it had matted all the loose hairs into a horseshoe shaped hard clump that could not be sucked into the tiny hole going to the large box on the bin. The bin had a very small amount of hair in it, not even filling 1/6th of the box.
This would be a nice vacuum for someone with a lot of tiny loose items on the floor, but not for a family with two dogs. Maybe for small short haired chihuahua type dogs it would be okay.
I returned it and reordered the Shark Upright Vacuum that we already had one of downstairs that has a LOT more suction for dog hairs. The new one will go upstairs. I know that Shark Upright works GREAT with dog hairs If anyone wants the model of that vac, which has worked great for me for 3 years, it is:
Shark NV356E 31 Navigator Lift-Away Professional Upright Vacuum with Swivel Steering, HEPA Filter, XL Dust Cup, Pet Power, Dusting Brush, and Crevice Tool, Perfect for Pet Hair, White/Silver"
3,Not good with dog hair,Tell me again about the self cleaning brush and how it’s supposed to stop dog hair from wrapping around it? This is a weekly event.
3,Wouldn't recommend,I got this vacuum because of all the positive reviews. No idea what I did wrong or maybe I got a defective one. But following the step by step directions it kept giving me an error 26 clogged filter code. It wasn't even used yet. No idea how that's possible. Well code finally went away and I tried connecting to my phone. Didn't connect. Tried my husband's and that didn't connect. I just ran it on clean without using our phone and I saw the vacuum pushing around a piece of dog kibble throughout my whole house. Didn't pick it up... I'm not sure why you'd have a vacuum that can't pick up anything but tiny crumbs and hair? Returned the item..
3,Brush gets clogged a lot,It’s been 2 months and the brush already gets jammed like once a week. The sweepers in the front need replaced too.
3,Should be called the Low-IQ Robot,"The Bad:

With over 100 runs totaling over 48 hours of run time, I still don't have a cohesive map. I've tried resetting it a few times. No luck. I've done everything to make sure the floors are clear, doors are open, and the lighting is good. My house isn't even big or complicated. It's only 1600sqft.

It also an angry little thing. It tries way too hard to push and climb everything. This often leads to it getting stuck, or shoes wandering across the hall.

The Google Assistant integration is pathetic. It does NOT appear in the Google Home app along with other smart devices. You have to install some weird feature on the individual smart speakers with which you want to control the robot. When you give a command, it's a different voice that answers. The wording for the commands has to be very specific.

One time, I did get a map that looked roughly like my house so I labeled all the rooms. I then commanded it to go clean the laundry room. It cleaned the office instead (wrong side of the house!) and then got lost.

It regularly can't find it's way back to the dock.

Shark has failed to deliver on its promise of a no-go zones feature.

The Good:

It cleaned rally well. I love the way it leaves a striped pattern on my high-pile carpet. Makes it look like a freshly mowed lawn.

Bagless auto empty bin works great, no complaints.

While it is painfully dumb, it does eventually clean most of the house.

The Verdict:

As a home automation nerd, I am sorely disappointed in it's ""smartness"". I've given up on the hope that I'll ever be able to say ""Hey Google, vacuum the kitchen."" However, given that I only paid $335 during the prime day sale, I decided to keep it. It really does keep the floors looking great, even if it has the IQ of a goldfish."
3,Was great,"1 year in and need new side brushes and bottom one shark doesn’t even have the main bottom one in stock been a month and the side brushes they sent don’t fit the AV2511AE extremely mad. It was amazing until now, these replacements make it run very loud and it doesn’t stay flat anymore shark support was a joke I guess Roborock here I come"
3,Beware,"Would be 5 stars but the ""no-go"" zone is sketchy at best. Went where it was not supposed to go and sucked up dog turds and smeared them all over floor and carpet. Cleaning the unit was an hour long process and 3 weeks later finally seems to be working as normal again. Do not trust it to stay in the boundaries."
3,A pretty good bye in general,"It's really noisy when it returns to bass and empties itself into the holding container. I last had a Neeto D6 and I liked it a better. They're about the same price but unfortunately that company no longer exists. Needle was definitely a better brand. It was much better at picking up sand from tile.
Also this vacuum cleaner doesn't like to go under my coffee table for some reason. It's exactly 5 in off the ground."
3,Too loud,"Does a great job cleaning the floors with multiple pets in the house, but the noise drives me crazy."
3,Doesn’t live up to the hype,"I switched from an older 600 series Roomba to the Shark brand because, with long hair and two cats, I really liked the self cleaning brush roll and the more methodical back and forth cleaning pattern. I always felt like the Roomba missed spots because it was so sporadic. Though as I type this my Shark has been cleaning in an identical loop for the last 25 minutes because it keeps getting stuck.

I love that it self empties and charges itself before resuming cleaning. But I’m disappointed that for whatever reason it doesn’t always completely empty the dust cup on the vacuum meaning I have to take the vacuum apart once a week to make sure it’s completely empty so it will function properly. I have to also clean hair off the brush roll once a week too. So much for self cleaning to prevent hair wrap.

The boundary strips don’t work. Which is why Kevin has been cleaning in an endless loop for nearly 30 mins. He keeps getting stuck on the spoke wheel base of a stand fan despite the fact that it’s ringed by boundary strips. I guess I’ll have to devise some ugly cardboard box solution. He’s supposed to be trying to find the base...

The moderate suction level isn’t great on thick carpet but I know that if I changed it to high suction it would probably take 3 hours instead of 2 to clean the whole apartment.

It’s almost NEVER connected to wifi unless I want to factory reset it once a day so it’s impossible to send it to clean a specific room. And it keeps deleting my map making it difficult to vacuum specific rooms as well.

Oh...Kevin is stuck again, guess I better go rescue him from the fan so he can stop vacuuming circles around my bedroom."
3,No go zones don’t work well,"It’s amazing except one thing. It ignores no go zones. So it gets stuck on my stairs every single day. Sometimes it gets the house first, sometimes I get home and it’s gone 6 feet hit the stairs and stopped. Before I moved to a house with stairs it was pretty awesome though"
3,Average robot vaccuum. Will try different brand next time.,"This is my first robot vacuum, which has been very helpful. However, I have several complaints:

1. The shark will chill under one chair for 10-30 minutes. It’s really annoying how when I run it for an hour he sits under one or two chairs when there is vast open floor space left untouched.
2. The vacuum follows you around. No matter where I go it keeps following me. There is definitely a sensor that causes it to follow moving objects. I was inspired to write this review because I was working on my laptop and the shark was under my feet for 30 minutes.
3. Sometimes the vacuum won’t return to the dock. For example, it was vacuuming under one barstool for 20 minutes so I sent it to the dock. It continued to vacuum for 5 minutes so I picked it up and placed it near the dock.
4. Connection issues with the app. There have been a few instances where the app would not work to control the vacuum.
5. The 30-45 day resevoir fills up in 4 days. I live in a house with two adults and one dog, yet I have to empty the chamber every few days.
6. The suction power is much less than a traditional vacuum. I would only recommend using this vacuum on hard floors. It is incredibly weak on carpet.

Overall, the vacuum is helpful, but the AI needs serious work."
3,Don’t recommend it,"I have had this product for over 2 years now. This is the first robot vacuum I have purchased. It has been frustrating to use the shark vacuum. At first it was the WiFi connection. It was extremely difficult to connect, and continually disconnected over the years. Then it was the mapping, which was a huge disappointment. It took a month worth of cleaning to map out the house the first time. Then each time the shark got turn off or ran out of battery because it failed to make it back to the dock, it would have to reconnect to WiFi and remap the house. On top of that the app is not capable of scheduling isolated areas. You must login and send it to clean each room (up to three rooms at a time). Keep in mind there were always connection issues with the shark, so sending it to clean or even telling it to stop cleaning wasn’t always an option. Because of this, we scheduled it to vacuum the whole house everyday. It lasted about 2-2.5 hours everyday, if it went off. There were times that connection would be lost, so therefore it would not be sent to go clean. Like I said it has been frustrating. On top of all this, it is a lot louder then expected but quieter then a normal vacuum. Recently the vacuum seems to be getting clogged a lot, despite me taking the time to clean every piece of it on several occasions. I gave this 3/5 because it was useful. During the times that it did what it was supposed to do, it was nice having it but those times we always short lived. I would not recommend this product to any one. Spend the money and go for a different brand. Don’t cheap out."
3,"Vacuum is great, software and firmware are not","The vacuum itself seems great, I’m not sure why people are saying it is loud. Our previous robot vacuum was much louder, so maybe it’s perspective. It seems to move around well, find its way back good and the self cleaning is really cool. All good stuff.

The issue is the software/firmware on the unit. It needs some serious improvement as it is clunky, unresponsive, and buggy. The wifi on the robot loses connectivity almost daily. I have to reset it by turning the robot off, then on again and it reconnects. One time, even this did not work and I had to ‘delete robot’ from the app and add it back because the wifi would not work. This completely erased the previous cleaning and mapping. It seems to run on the set schedule and at random times. One night it turned itself on at 2:00 AM and started cleaning. Bottom line is the robot itself cleans well, but the software (the app) and firmware (running on the robot) need to be tweaked, a LOT. I don’t think this is the experience that Shark wants for its customers.

2022 Update
Our robot vacuum died after less that 2 years. Calls to customer service were not helpful. We kept getting the dreaded ‘Error number 2’ which has a plethora of online conspiracy theories on how to fix but nothing concrete. After Shark customer service said there was ‘something wrong inside’ and we would need to buy a new one, I took ours apart and was shocked at how much crap gets stuck in the internal mechanisms. I cleaned out everything, rebuilt the thing and there was no improvement. This one is going in the garbage and I’m on the hunt for a new model that is not ‘Shark’."
3,It is ok,"First of all, it does not mop. Demo video is misleading, but overall showed a lot of the vacuum. I had this for about 3 weeks. It gets about 70% of the floor and struggles with corners and under tables. It also has trouble with bed skirts and curtains."
3,Shark vacuum RV1001AE,"We have wood floor, itt was working for the past couple of months then I started to notice everytime it hits at little bump (carpet) it leaves some of the debris that it was collecting behind so I get a trail along my carpet."
3,Returning Shark IQ robot. It will not clean in the dark.,"I purchased my first robot vacuum over a decade ago and love the convenience of these appliances in spite of their shortcomings. My biggest complaint has always been the small bin capacity that must be emptied daily and the tangled rollers that must be cleaned on a regular basis.

When I saw the auto empty feature of the Shark IQ I knew I had to have one.

I read the reviews carefully between the Roomba i7/i9 and Shark IQ. I could not resist the 50% price savings with the Shark and decided I was willing to live with any minor deficiencies. The biggest online complaints I found were with the room mapping feature. Since that's a feature I've never had, I wasn't sure how important that would be to me and I decided to move forward with my purchase.

Fortunately for me, the mapping worked perfectly out of the box and within 2-3 cleanings I had a complete map of our 2 bedroom apartment. Note: My experience seems to be the best case as compared to other reviewers.

Unfortunately, I found the camera mapping does not work at night and our Shark would flounder a few feet from its base for 15min then return to base without cleaning.

We schedule our vacuum robots 80% of the time for night-time use. It's one of the great features of a robot vacuum to have it clean at night preparing a clean room for the next busy day. Also, cleaning at night doesn't get in your way as much.

We are returning the Shark IQ and will be looking for a model that has both the auto empty trash bin and uses LIDAR to map so it can be used in the dark.

If you don't need to clean in the dark, I would recommend this vacuum.

It is well worth the 1/2 price of a Roomba i7/i9."
3,One Year Review,"Apparently, I haven't written a review. So here's my one year review. I am a Shark fan. I've had three Shark vacuums, an air fryer, steam mop and coffee pot. I'm normally a Shark fan. However. The Shark robot is like a weak handshake on a new colleague. Yes. My shark vacuums every day. I have four dogs and two cats. It does a great job getting all the Shepard and retriever dog hair. And I only have to empty it once a week. But that brush. Ugh. Weak handshake. This machine will not pick up fine dust or dander or grit. It would be nice if they could put the Shark Vertex brush on it. Then this machine would be a powerhouse. So. I follow up with the old faithful OKP Life. Granted I have to empty this guy everyday. But everyday, he reminds me of all the dander, dust and grit he finds. And he vacuums under the sofa.

Am I happy with this? Sure."
1,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY,"***Third UPDATE---READ THIS

I've had this Shark robot for a little over a year, having bought it last year as a part of the Black Friday sale that went on for this vaccuum. I am very sad and disappointed to say that it died on me. It refuses to charge as of last week, gives no errors, and there's nothing I can do.

What a shoddy piece of craftsmanship that barely worked for the year I owned it then died inexplicably after. DO NOT BUY IT unless you enjoy being constantly frustrated and disappointed by a terrible machine that will stop working right after the warranty runs out. One more time to make it clear: THIS PRODUCT IS TERRIBLE AND YOU SHOULD NOT BUY IT.

**Second Update: Nearly a year of ownership on, and I have YET to be able to get this robot to produce a map that even remotely resembles my house so I can clean room by room on a daily/weekly basis. It just does not work, and I have no idea how to change it. I've heard that camera based robots like this one do require the lights on, so I've scheduled it to run at 12 every day and I purposefully open up the curtains to ensure natural light comes in. In areas where this isn't possible, I turn the lights on. Despite this, and months and months of trying and deleting maps over and over again, I can't get it to work. Seriously, get the Roomba i7. It's got a lot fewer problems, and admittedly is more expensive, but at least that one works! Don't get stuck with this barely functional robot like I did!

*Alright, this is an update from my previous review based on about 9 months of experience with this Robot. It's pretty good at actually cleaning the carpets and getting rid of the dust around our home, but it comes with quite a few major caveats. It's convenient and functional, but problematic. If you want a GOOD robot vacuum, you'll need to go at least with the Roomba i7.

To start off let me say that we got this robot after watching the video recommendation from the youtube channel vaccuum wars. I bought this because he said the robot was one he worked on, and he gives very thorough and great reviews. I wish I hadn't listened to him and gotten the Roomba instead.

The single biggest problem I have with this Robot is the mapping feature. The app says it takes 10 runs to get a feel for your house. I have no idea how the feature actually works because... well, I've been through 5 maps at least and the robot has yet to get an accurate picture of my house that enables me to tell it to clean room by room. It's never worked, and this is supposedly a marquee feature of this bot. Usually, the map I get is some weird partial abomination of the front room and part of the hallway. It regularly enters the bedroom on accident and I have no idea why it seems to struggle with putting that into a map. Shark clearly has very little experience working with robot vacuums and it shows.

For context, our house is 2300 Square feet, with a mostly open floorplan layout with a large front room that consists of the kitchen, living room, and dining area, with a long hallway off to the side that connects to all the other rooms in the house. One of the reasons we picked this bot over others was because it's a fairly large house and we didn't want to have to constantly empty the vacuum. We have a dog who sheds a decent amount and this robot does manage to keep the pet hair under control. I leave all the doors open while it cleans so it can build a proper picture. I did eventually learn that VSLAM (camera-based navigation) robots NEED to have the lights on or a source of ambient light when they're navigating so they can find their way back to the base so I began leaving the curtains and blinds open, along with a couple of lights on. Seeing as 3PM is the middle of the day there's plenty of natural light so we can save on our electricity bill by not having to keep the lights on, which I highly recommend you do if you can.

The Robot runs every day at 3PM to do a cleaning of the house. Since I'm at home all the time now due to the pandemic I can catch it if it gets stuck, and boy does that happen often. We have furniture with metal bases that it sometimes manages to get itself into and stuck on. Also, heaven forbid you ever leave a single sock or dog toy on the floor before it runs---it will absolutely find them and get stuck. It also just adores eating our long drapey curtains in the bedroom even though I've positioned the magnet strip in front of it. The magnet strip has to be there because the App doesn't include no-go zones like for a Roomba or a Neato vacuum, not that I ever got the map to work anyway. It frequently just pushes the magnet boundary and gets stuck on the curtains. It's such a pain.

The vacuum base where it collects the dust and debris after cleaning is very useful. I love not having to deal with emptying the robot constantly like I would need to with basically any other robot vacuum. It's not really possible to have them work in a big house like ours. It holds several cleanings worth of dust and I have to empty it about once a month (the robot will tell you that it's full). The robot does not consistently struggle to find its way back to the base or get lost in our house. Usually when it fails to return it's because it got stuck on a dog toy, not because it can't find its way back. Although based on other reviews, your mileage may vary."
1,"JUNK: Can get stuck in trivial situations, SHARK Service incapable of problem solving","Update: The vacuum can get stuck on certain obstacles such as door jambs or sliding door tracks even if there is a guarding boundary strip. You need to be very careful to position the boundary strips so that they are not close to an obstacle. If the robot gets stuck on an obstacle and the robot can sense the boundary strip, the strip can actually ensnare the robot by preventing the robot from withdrawing from the obstacle so try to be sure that robot can not straddle an obstacle and a strip simultaneously.

We had figure this out ourselves because Shark service could not (they wasted a few hours of our lives trying to solve the problem). We still recommend this vacuum but if you have a navigation issue such as the robot getting stuck or lost you will be better off trying to solve it yourself than you will with calling Shark.

Caveat: We are new to using robotic vacuums so we're probably easier to please than the jaded user. We have four large dogs, 2 short haired and 2 long haired, all 4 shed like crazy. We have hard floors (randomly patterned) that shows the hair big time. Even though we brush the dogs frequently, we need to vacuum daily just to get the shed hair taken care of, it's tedious.

On Prime Day we were notified of a good deal on this vacuum (Shark RV1001AE). So we ordered both it and a Eufy 11S (highly rated) to compare. While the comparison was helpful, had we known then what we know know now, we would have gotten two of the Shark RV1001AE units.

We first tried the Eufy 11S. It is easy to setup and use but it failed after the first cleaning circuit. After that it would not charge fully so it no longer works. This is just as well since for us the collection reservoir would have to be emptied on every usage. While this is (barely) tolerable, it also doesn't clean very well which is not OK. While it must create a map (since it can get back to the charging station) its path is somewhat random much like the path of a billiard ball on a table. If it could run for many hours, it would eventually cover the entire area (though inefficiently). Since it runs for only an hour or so, it leaves significant areas were hair/dust is not picked up (as shown on one Eufy customer review). Even at though it's missing large amounts of dust/hair it still picks up enough hair that it stops vacuuming. So for us, the Eufy 11S fails...

In contrast the Shark RV1001AE maps out a fairly specific path by creating an outline of the area to be vacuumed (based on the hitting natural or provided boundaries). It then breaks down the area into strips and does a reasonable job of traversing these strips. We have run the robot twice and it already has a very good map of the area to vacuum. The self empty feature of the Shark RV1001AE is a huge advantage for us and it seems to work well. On days when the dogs are shedding the worst it is entirely possible that it will have to empty mid cleaning circuit. We haven't seen this happen yet but the feature is great for us.

The Shark was able to find the basic area even though our Border Collie (happily) tried to herd it. Maybe the area that we permitted it to vacuum is simpler than others users areas but for us it found the area quickly including the boundaries established by furniture etc..

Problems we have noticed:

1. It requires light to navigate so it evidently can't vacuum at night with lights off and if it gets stuck in a dark area ( under a couch with long skirts) it will spend some time trapped though in the case we noted, it did eventually get out.

2. We would like to run it twice daily but so far the app doesn't support it.

3. It's a bit noisy (clothes dryer level).

4. We had to switch our phones to 2.4G network to initially connect but after the setup we're able to use the app with our phones set to 5G.

5. Be careful to insure that the robot cannot sense the presence of a boundary strip while it is either in close proximity to or at an obstacle. This can trap the robot.

Do we like this? So far, yes and we regret not getting two. C'est la vie."
1,So many things wrong,"So I've had this for about 2.5 years now. At first it was alright, seemingly ran about vacuuming acceptably. And that's the end of the good things I have to say. Self cleaning brush roll? Doesn't stand a chance with two girls with long hair, a cat, and 3 dogs that shed. There is consistently hair wrapped around the brush roll and in have to flip it over and remove it because it stops with an error. Hair gets wond on the outside of the roll as well causing the same issue.

Let's talk about its IQ mapping... well... it's marginal acceptable at best. Sure it maps my house, Yay. It gets stuck on the edge of the stairs every day it runs. I come home to it having accomplished a whole 15 ft of cleaning before it's at the stairs and stops with the ledge error. Now this would be one thing if it learned at all! But no! Every day for 2 years. Same spot every day. It's not like the stairs move, it knows they are there. It just is that dumb to not avoid the edge it knows its there.

But it gets better! Do you have chairs? This thing can't even find its way out from under my dining room chairs. It helplessly drives around in a tiny circle for about 5 minutes hitting each leg until it gives up and throws an error and stops. So you have rugs? Well consider things l this garage! Because it'll suck up the end of the rug edge and throw an error as well.

So on to the app! Well where to start. There are no firmware updates, so don't expect your $400 vaccum to ever improve! Does it follow directions you give it? Wouldn't that be great! I can select certain rooms to clean an it just completely ignores what you tell it to do and will just vacuum everything anyway. Have a room to avoid with an obstacle it gets stuck in? Well good luck because this awesome piece of technology doesn't care that your said to not go there!

Now the best part! The app offers you to make no go zones. But this model doesn't even work with that option! So for a year u frustratingly set no go zones to stand there bewildered why it would still go under my couch and ripping all my speaker cords up. Which is ridiculous because it can map your whole house. You want a no go zones in the app? Well you have to make rooms around the obstacle and how it will only clean the selected area. Magnetic strip? Oh! Thank God they sent a whole 8ft of it for my whole house! No one could possibly have anymore area than that they want to block off, like any single piece of furniture.

This has been my worst shark purchase ever, which sucks because I love my other upright vaccum. But I'll probably never buy another again. There is no support, you have to Google for to even email customer service to reach them. No updates, no firmware. Just the dumbest IQ vaccum you've ever had. The best response you can expect to get from Shark is oh we're sorry. Yeah we have that on the app but it's completely non functional because we're to lazy to push a fir.ware update to make no go zones work. Sorry but the vacuum doesn't need LIDAR to be able to not go somewhere on the map Shark! Simple fix but you're just absolutely lazy and don't care."
1,So far so bad but improving,"Final update:
I made the mistake of saying that it doesn't get stuck in my last review and sure enough the same day it started getting stuck every run. it gets to the stairs or the transition between two different color floors and decided that it's cliff sensors are blocked and wont go any further. Tried all the fixes from the manufacturer and still doing the same thing. Time to try Amazon's return service.
Update 2:
Overall good value for the price and for the most part will keep your floors very clean. I will keep it due to the price being half the cost of the Roomba. Read on for the specifics....
After 62 cleaning runs it finally finds it's way back to base pretty consistently. Does a good job of cleaning what it can reach, but does not do well on edges. It's not fast, between going back to empty the tiny bin and recharging it takes 4 hours to clean ~1000 SQF. It seldom gets stuck, 2 or 3 times out of 62 is not bad. The application overall sucks but that can be fixed with time, it often has to restart and doesn't update when you have it open. There have been multiple times that I had to force close and reopen it 4 or 5 times to get it to work at all. The scheduling works well but you can only set one scheduled run per day and you cant tell it what power level to use. The dustbin is just plain stupid, it is TINY and does not have a sensor to tell the bot to go empty it when it gets full. The mechanism to keep hair and such from getting tangled on the brushes works, its basically a comb that the brushes turn against. Sounds good but if there is a lot of hair on your floor the hair gets stuck in the comb and prevents the bin from emptying itself.

Update 1:
Added an additional star, after 15 runs it now is able to get back to its base 1 out of 3 times so there's hope. On the other hand the battery life is horrible, even in low power mode it can't do 1200sqf without 2 full recharges and it seems that if it has to go back for a third charge it just gives up and won't finish which is really annoying since the area it most often skips is the one that I care about most. Eventually, some day when it's done mapping they claim you can tell it to do a specific area so at least there's a possibility of a fix.

After 4 hours and 1 partial cleaning here's what i know so far. First 4 stars for picking up a LOT, minus 3 for not being smart enough to know that it was so full that it had filled the extremely small bin and then packed the brush area completely full as well. 2 stars for cleaning in straight lines instead of wandering about randomly. Minus 1 for really struggling on flat carpeting, you could hear it really bog down and the brush speed seemingly cut in half every time it hit the carpeting. I can only imagine how it would do on carpeting with any pile to it. Plus 5 for self emptying, it does a great job which takes robot vacuums from being a novelty to being an actually useful tool. Minus 5 for it's ability to return to the base, the battery got discharged so as you would expect it turned the vacuum and brushes off and then continued to wander aimlessly around the room until the battery was completely dead. I'm hopeful that over time it will work out its mapping and be able to return to the base and if so I will update to 5 stars, if not I will sadly return it"
1,Rubbish product for the price and NO customer service,"I disliked the price, the fact I had to order from USA and pay extra tax then pay 120 dollars more for a suitable transformer and then to discover that the APP was nit available to me. I then contacted SHARK so-called "" customer service"" to ask about accessing APP in Europe and why they would sell the product without access to the APP... No reply!!
I now have to reset the machine so it "" thinks"" it is cleaning a new room each time, otherwise it goes around in circles,simply not having a clue as to what it is expected to do! For a robotic device, I would have thought you start it off and let it "" do it's thing"" ..it is actually more hassle than a ' regular' vacuum cleaner at twice the price! I will be contacting SHARK to return it!
The real disappointment is that I bought it on the back of a SHARK floor steam cleaner , that I can honestly say is the best product I have ever purchased for the job it is meant to do!
SHARK "" Click and flip "" is the best steam cleaner you could ever hope for on a hard floor so I am truly disgusted that this does not do what it is supposed to and SHARK don't want to know!

Hmm!
lots of emails from you saying roughly "" hey you're a great customer. here's a discount voucher for your next purchase""  but not even the decency to reply to an ACTUAL question??  Please reply to my original request regarding access to the Shark clean App in Europe! 
Apparently I'm "" in the club "" for purchasing more of your products but as a customer, not rated when it comes to a genuine question. Sadly will NEVER be buying another SHARK product... ROOMBA all the way from here on and same advice to all those in my rather large organisation. The one thing I abhor is lack of customer service and to not even reply is simply ignorant and rude and I will advise my many colleagues  of same and suggest that  they too pass on the information to their many colleagues. It is not difficult to reply to a request and you clearly have the resources to try to tempt folk into purchasing more of your product. 
Please just give me a link to your APP! Is it so difficult? Is a simple reply so beyond you?

Hi there,
 I purchased a SHARK IQ self cleaning robot from the US Amazon store and then got a ( rather expensive ) stepdown transformer to use it here in Ireland. The machine works fine, although does seem to go over the same ground a lot before moving to next section.
My problem is that I can't download the App from Google Play and when I try to download from SHARK website I am simply redirected to Google Play. I'm not sure why your App should be geo sensitive and would be grateful if you can let me know how to download or provide a link to it.
Thank you and look forward to hearing from you .
Regards,
Níall

1,"It does vacuum floors, but it’s going back!","UPDATE - Nope! It’s going back. I’m spending 10 minutes every time this thing runs cleaning it. This last time it had dirty in the area where the roller is. The hair on the roller prevented it from getting to bin area on the robot.

We have one dog. I can only imagine what would happen if we had 2.

Maybe if you had no dogs and no one with long hair in your home this would be a good machine.

I actual got it because friend with dogs said it works great. They have short haired small dogs. My first reaction was the hair from my Malamute would kill it. And I’m partially right. The hair didn’t kill it, but it’s just too much of a hassle having to clean it on every run.

———————

It’s a smart little machine and it vacuums fairly well but don’t believe the info on it about pet hair. We have a malamute that’s a semi wooly. That means long hair.

The machine mapped the house well and on its first run did a good job. But, on its second run we had an error that the roller was jammed. So we followed the direction and removed it to clean. We found the drive end of the roller had our dogs hair rapped around it. It had caught all of the long hairs and twisted it around the orange drive end.

We removed the hair and also removed it from the brush and rubber vane. It does not clean the brush roller of hair. It gets rapped around it and you have to remove it manually.

The machine ran good for 2 more runs and it errored out again with the same issue. This time we did not find any hair around the orange drive end. So we cleared the error and tried again. We got the same error 2 more times with not see anything on the drive end. This time I removed the green stationary end and found a big wad of hair rapped around it. I removed the hair and ran normally. The small wheel in the front of the unit also had hair wrapped around the small pin that’s mounts the wheel. It was very tough to remove and I could not get all of it out.

This does not bode well for the long term serviceability of the unit.

The app does not let you resume after an error like this. So the unit must start all over again. The spot clean size is not adjustable. Over well the app is 7 out of 10.

We are still on the fence about this unit. Right now it’s a 50-50 chance that we will return it.

I will update this review with pictures the next time it faults out. Which will probably be after the next 2 times it cleans."
1,Great concept but very poor execution,"Save your money for something else. I've had this robot vacuum for a few months and while it has been working just ok, about 6 weeks ago it completely lost its mind. I bought this to replace an older, less expensive and less sophisticated robot vacuum. It initially mapped my house ok after several attempts, and had been running its program around the house, but it didn't pick up as much as my previous vac. The old vac would just bump around the house in no pattern but definitely picked up a lot of dust and debris. The shark never seemed to pick up quite as much, even though it runs a grid back and forth through all your rooms. It just didn't seem to have as much suction. I had it set to clean the house Monday and Friday morning while I was at work. Then one day it's like the shark went on strike. Wouldn't leave the room it's docked in or would only do that room and one other. Average run time would be 9 minutes. Then maybe it would fight it's way around the perimeter a room bumping into the wall for 20 minutes and skipping most of the room. Use the app to send it to clean one room and it would do part of that room then wander off to other parts of the house and start bumping into walls and furniture. My house is small, around 1100 sq ft, wide open with no obstructions at all. Deleted the map, and it struggled to make a new map. Several phone calls with customer support and them having me do all the standard ""clean the sensors"" ""make sure you remove obstacles"" ""check your Wi-Fi connection"" ""check this or that setting in your app"" multiple times, multiple calls. Finally after a month they decided they were going to replace it. Tracking shows it has been returned to them for a week and still no response or shipping confirmation. (which they said would happen as soon as it was returned) Emails to them questioning when my replacement was going to ship are responded the next day with ""we will update you when we've got any more information"" At this point I've been without a working vacuum for 6 weeks so I had to go buy another to clean my house. Customer support is slow to respond to emails and every time I call in I have to explain everything again from scratch. I honestly wish they would just return my money instead of sending me another one. I had hoped the shark would clean as good as or better than my old one and I would be able to run it on a schedule while I was at work or send it to do one or two rooms if needed. That's what it is supposed to do but for me it's fallen well short of my expectations and it's claims"
1,You'd be better off not vacuuming at all than use this robot,"I'll keep this as short as I can. after 5 months of usage, I just realized I could have returned it 3 weeks ago and now I am very sad. I will probably donate it just to get rid of it. I have the Shark Self Empty Extra Large RV1001AE, asin=B07S864GPW, just in case amazon decides to show this under some other product...

Pros:
- This vacuum will teach your grandmother to suck eggs (maybe one day someone somewhere will get that joke, but I mean it has good suction).
- This vacuum runs in very neat straight lines, back and forth.
- This vacuum self empties, as long as you run it often enough that it doesn't clog before it tries to do so.
- This robot vacuum looks cool
- This robot vacuum is slim enough to fit under pretty close to any furniture that has legs
- I have never had any issues with the app
- In 5 months it has never fallen down the stairs once
- It can vacuum thick plush bathroom floor rugs
- Eco mode gets you an extra 25-35 minutes of battery life

Cons:
- A dung beetle in a manure farm can find its way around better than this vacuum can. With a dead battery, still running the vacuum motor and side sweepers, this robot will go right up to the door to exit the room it is in while headed directly towards its charging base, and then turn around and go back in the room instead.
- It cannot locate where it came from unless it is within 5 feet of the charging base.
- In 5 months, it has never completed a map of the 2nd floor of my house
- 30% of the time it finishes vacuuming the entire floor
- 90% of the time it forgets what rooms it has vacuumed after charging (maybe it naps too long?) and often revacuums places it has already been (maybe it found a LOT of dirt there and wanted to be nice, so it went over it again?)
- 60% of the time it never leaves the base again after charging up unless I manually start it again (I have never used the scheduler, because a reviewer on here said it would learn to map the house faster if you run it manually...) and I cannot guarantee the floor will be completely accessible and cleared for it at any given time.
- If you have to change anything about your wifi, you have rename your robot and add it again as if it was a new device
- In order to get the robot to find its charging station, you have to chase it down, tehn walk next to it on the right hand side, so it can run in to your foot over and over again while it tries to turn right every 1-4 inches (2-10 cm) to go anywhere but to the charging base.
- Eco mode prevents it from picking up most of whatever is on/in your carpet.
- It takes 90+ minutes to recharge between runs.
- I am pretty sure it takes 5 minutes to forget if it was running before, where it had gone before, and if it is supposed to go somewhere other than where it is now.
- you cannot assign it to clean a specific room until it maps the entire floor.

Summary:
For $150 bucks less, go buy a Neato, it always returns home and creates a full map EVERY time it runs (I have one of those too and may very well replace this with another Neato). I bought the shark to be able to select rooms to vacuum (something the model of NEato I bought does not do), as I got it for my 2nd floor, I wanted to be able to skip my daughter's room if it was a mess. But I can't because it cannot figure out how to map my floor and you need a map to tell it where to go and where not to."
1,Received Broken,"Bought a Shark Ultra AI Robot. The exterior packaging was fine. There was not a mark on it. I removed it from it shipping container and the box was damaged. Opened the box and all the interior shipping material was damaged. Removed the robot from the box and there is a whole punctured into the the top of the robot. I called Amazon immediately only to find out that I actually bought it from a third party and it would take 30 days to receive a refund and possibly another 7 days for my bank to process the refund.
I complained since I would have to pay again for the robot I would have a substantial amount of money outstanding till I received my refund.
After several hours I was told I could return the robot directly to Shark and was given a phone number to call. Before I could write the number down or contact the web site the information would disappear and I would have to call them back.. This happened numerous times till I finally got the phone number.
So now I call Shark only to find the phone number has been disconnected. So now I look up the sharp website and finally find another number to call. After being disconnected several times and getting a clear connection by going out side I speak with a tech who after going through many steps that showed the robot working asks me what is wrong.. I show him a picture of the robot with a hole in the top. I get sent two emails and told there would be shipping label attached to one of them. I indicate there is no shipping label attached any where and am informed that it may take unto 2 hours for the label to catch up. Needless to say after 2 hours no shipping has arrived and the help desk is closed for the night.
I call back the next morning and no joke after being disconnected 14 times I get through a call with a satisfactory result. This person knew I was having difficulties all morning puts me on hold and escalates the problem up several lines of management... He gets back on the line and says I got good news and bad news.
First the good news... a new robot is in shipping to me and I will receive it in 5 days. Great I do not have to lay out any money to get my new machine and in a relatively short time. The bad news is because of all the problems getting me a shipping notice, which were not my fault it will take at least 5 days for the shipping label to return the damaged robot.
Kudos to shark for finding a reasonable solution. This is something Amazon could have done easily from the beginning.. As a result my wife and I are considering discontinuing our relationship with Amazon. There was no reason for this problem take 2 days of my time, when Amazon could have shipped me a new product right from the beginning.

1,This is a poor man's Roomba i7+,"I have a Roomba i7+ and bought the Shark IQ R101 for my mother's house hoping that it would perform as good or close to the Roomba i7+. At half the price of the Roomba, I thought it was worth trying it out. Well, you get what you pay for. The Shark IQ is basically a poor man's Roomba. It looks the same, even makes a little jingle at the end like the Roomba when the self disposing bin empties, but in terms of performance there's no comparison.

First, I was surprised at how loud the Shark IQ is. It sounds like a helicopter doing laps around your house. (see uploaded video) It's pretty obnoxious. Second, the machine takes a long time to return to its dock - if it returns, that is. In all my times running it, it would make it back to dock about 50% of the time. The other times, I would have to go around hunting for it. For some reason, it would just stop at random places in the house with some error message. Third, I ran it about 15 times, and that still wasn't enough to map out my house. I was hoping to have it on a regular schedule where I could clean room by room a few times a week. By the 15th time of running it, I gave up on having it try to map out my place. Fourth, there are some annoying design flaws in this product. For example, it's difficult and awkward to connect the power cord to the back of the machine. Also, the bagless disposal bin is tricky to empty. When you empty it in the trash, there was a lot of dust and my dog's hair caught up in the cylindrical mesh filter. You're basically having to pull it out by hand, and when you do that, the dust and other particles escape into the air, creating a bit of a mess. Anyway, I wanted to like this given the cost of the machine, but it was a big disappointment. If you're considering this product, I would just pay the few extra hundred dollars to get the real thing."
1,Not durable and poor mapping,"This unit has always had one problem or another. As a result it would vacuum on occasion, but not at all reliably. The biggest problem is that after about 6 months (1-2 months of which it didn't run at all), it started regularly giving errors about the bumper being stuck. Yes there is a process to clean the sensors. However i started having to do this in about a weekly basis. Also since it has never really mapped out my house, I eventually test the map for it to remap from scratch. Since then it has never been able to actually create a new map and just drives aimlessly. The dust bin says it is full when it is not, so it stops randomly if it hasn't already stopped fit the ""stuck bumper"". Just completely useless for what was paid for it.

I'm really frustrated as we live in the country with time floors and when it worked, it was great for picking up the daily sand and dirt that gets tracked in from us and the pets.

Update: I've reduced it to one star. It has been failing with even more issues and it is effectively completely non-functional. The front bumper has a shield that has fallen out, so the sensors are now exposed, and seem to also be failing. Also after moving the base location to allow it to be more central in the house, it failed to generate a new map. Now after having had it powered off for a month, I went to try setting it up again, and the app has forgotten the robot, and can't even reestablish a Wi-Fi connection even though everything else is working fine. Absolute trash in less than a year. I've debated trying a different brand, but I think this may have just put me off these things all together."
1,"Despite a few nuances, we love this thing","** Update 12/2022
**BEWARE**: Shark decided to not support any phones with less than Android 10.
When I tried to update, the app was uninstalled and cannot reinstall the app.

Bottom Line: We no longer can control our vacuum.

Tech Support said to get a new phone. Maybe, but for sure, I won't be buying any more Shark products.

Also, do not believe the lie that it works well for dog hair. Dog hair never even makes it into the bin. It just accumulates behind the brush, meaning CONSTANT cleaning (Lab and Basset Hound)

**Update
We have had this for 1 year and a few months now. I now have 2 dogs (lab and basset hound) and a cat.
We still like it, but there is one really glaring flaw. It absolutely does NOT pick up dog hair. Well, it does pick it up, but will gather it in the toothed area just in front of the dust bin, and there it will stay. It will not make it to the dust bin, so will rarely empty. It requires regular cleaning - every other day for us. Yay! not.

Also, if there is too much hair on the floor, it will leave clumps laying around. So, you really need to use this every day if you have animals.

This is a substantial design flaw, given Sharks' claim to pick up dog hair. We still use it, as it is easier than vacuuming every day, but it sure would be nice if this was not an issue.
*************
We love it, but there are some realities to accept:

We have a lab and a cat. The dog hairs eventually will clog the vacuum. I run it every week day and pretty much need to manually clean once a week. Still, running daily, we hardly ever touch a broom these days.

It does struggle with transition onto area rugs with medium-deep pile.

It is smart; it will map out your whole area and it will clean the whole area - every time. The downside - it is smart, so when you move furniture, etc - you will need to have it relearn the house.

The software is pretty good. once the vacuum maps the house, you have the ability to map and identify rooms. This part of it can use some work. Mapping rooms that are irregular, such as hallways, cannot be done - squares and rectangles only. So instead of 8 rooms, I have to break out into more than 10.

The real problem with this is you can select to clean your whole house or up to 3 rooms. 3 rooms is quite a restriction. We want the common areas and master bedroom done daily. We can't program for that, we have to clean the whole house. Not really a problem, but unnecessary.

This vacuum is really cool in that it will vacuum until full, go to the base, empty, and pick up where it left off. MUCH, MUCH better than having to manually dump every time it gets full. I empty the base every couple weeks.

One side-effect is that every day at lunch, we are running around to get everything off the floor that will get in it's way. So our house is always neat now :).

Another cool aspect is that Shark updates this. It's connected to your WIFI, so updates are automatic (I think). We have REALLY noticed an improvement in the amount of time it takes to map the house with the latest update. So, instead of buying a new robot every time an update is needed, this should last and improve for some time.

We would like if dog hair did not clog regularly. Nothing is perfect but we are satisfied so far."
1,Terrible Experience,"We have just purchased our first house and with 2 dogs we knew a robot vaccum would be a great fit with our very open floor plan and Hardwood surfaces throughout our home. We purchased this because We have heard of some great experiences, but unfortunately this was not the case for us:/ We had our robot vaccum running for about 3 weeks until one day I came home to what seemed for it to be bead in the middle of the room. After some checking and placing it back on its charger it kept giving and error number 6 (bumper Stuck) We tried EVERYTHING you can think of to troubleshoot before lastly removing the bumper which was pretty easy to make sure everything was in order and in fact it was perfectly normal. I called customer service who was useless after being on hold for over 30 minutes. They told me they would have been happy to help but because I removed 5 little screws from the bumper all they could do was give a 10% discount from a 600 dollar value (it’s literally half that on amazon lol). So basically we got to three weeks from a vaccum that was mid (barely cleaned against the floor and wall) couldn’t get any help, and tried to get ripped off. Im not one to write reviews but this was simply terrible. I am going a different route and hoping for a better experience. I’m sure other work great but would have love to have some support not even a month after purchase. I’d seriously consider looking at others even if they are a tad more for a better product and better service."
1,"Two vacuums, both lasted about 30 days before malfunctioning.","Update again: I have had the second vacuum for just under 30 days again and I am sending this one back for a full refund. I posted a picture of this one malfunctioning now as well. I noticed the last couple of times when it went back to the dock, the suction sounded different and I thought ""Here we go again"". Sure enough, the vacuum bumped into my dining room chairs and would notify me it was stuck on something. But looking closely at it, it was not stuck on anything. I watched it bump into a chair again and the same thing happened. I tried running it two more times that same day and any time it bumped into an object, the vacuum said it was stuck on something. Today I ran it again, and it was only running 30 seconds, bumped into my plant and stopped. I sent it back to the dock. Ran it again to show my husband and this time it didn't touch anything and said it was stuck on something(see the picture). I'm really disappointed in this vacuum.

Update: I had the vacuum for just under 30 days and I noticed the vacuum started zigzagging all over my house. The last day I used it, it cleaned our bedroom like 4 or 5 times. At one point it said it was stuck on something but it was in the middle of the floor, nothing around it or wrapped up in the vacuum. Then it went to the dock and kept making the noise like it was connecting to the dock. I cleaned the dock and the vacuum thinking that would solve the issue and it kept making the same noise. So I tried to have the vacuum clean a small area, the vacuum said it was on un-level ground. After turning it off and back on, checking everything and seeing nothing was out of sorts, dealing with customer service through Amazon, they sent me a replacement. Fingers crossed this one works fine.

Our main floor has our kitchen, dining, living room and master. All areas where there is a lot of foot traffic and our dogs. The dogs shed too. This shark robot vacuum I bought a week ago, it mapped out the house and has ran every other day. It has been great helping me keep up with the vacuuming. The vacuum does fit under our dinning chairs and table. The vacuum has not become stuck on any furniture. Because the floor plan is larger than 1,800 sq feet, I did turn on the ""resume after charge"". The vacuum will get half way through the house and charge for an hour or so then go back to the area it left off. It has not been skipping spaces but I have noticed it goes over some spots more than once. I am not sure why but I am not bothered by it. I run the vacuum from the schedule on the app. I have not ran it at night since it needs lights on and the suction from the vacuum into the bin is loud. The other feature I like on the app is pressing the clean button, you can then tell it to clean a particular area. Lastly, I am glad it has the clean and dock buttons on the vacuum, our wifi went out unexpectedly and I was able to press the dock button and the vacuum went right back to where it needed to be. I really like this vacuum and I hope it lasts a few years."
1,I did LOVE this robot vacuum!,"Update: we are a few day past owning this for only 2 months. Our vacuum has now started to power down/not return to its dock for charging and not completing vacuuming for 5 nights in a row despite being returned to the dock for a full days worth of charging. Customer service cannot be reached for help and the website wont register our item for warranty purposes (gets stuck in a never ending loading loop when hitting submit for registering). At only 2 months I did not anticipate having issues and cannot exercise the warranty because it won't let me register and I can't get ahold of a person anyway. I hate to say it because I love our previous shark items but it's probably best to avoid.

I want to start by saying our floors prob get dirtier than most. We live in the desert so there's the dust factor right off the bat, but we also have two giant breed dogs, a cat, and a 4yr old running around on them. This vacuum works great and I love that it self empties because our last robot vacuum couldn't finish a full clean without me needing to empty the tiny container on top of it. I wouldnt say it will hold more than a couple weeks worth of cleaning but again it's picking up more than prob most homes would have. Some people have said there are issues with corner cleaning because the little spiny brushes on the side only have one set of brushes instead of three like other vacs. We haven't had that issue but I did preemptively buy replacement pieces that do have three brushes for that part so it's an easy fix. I also really like the ap and love that I can program areas on the ap for the vac to avoid like where we keep our dogs water bowls on a mat for example. Really happy so far with this one!"
1,Worst Vaccum ever.,"Update: This thing is completely worthless at less than a year. I spend more time cleaning it and resetting it and finding it after it gets lost and dies then it would take to just vacuum myself. Waste of money.

Had this for 8 months.
I have spent more time reconnecting, resetting, rescuing, and fixing this thing then it has vacuuming.

This is probably as much a review of the app as the vacuum but since you can't run the vacuum without it being fully connected to the app and wifi I consider it one dumpster fire instead of two.

The map never really completes, you just give up and hit ok.
Then it won't take the rooms.
When it finally does it last about a week and the app shifts the map ever so slightly and throws off the position of the base. So now your vacuum wonders around trying to figure out where it is instead of cleaning the one room you sent it to.

You can't make adjustments to the map. The vacuum will never update the map once you say it's good. The only option is delete it and start completely over. Which requires anything from 7 to 40 uninterrupted runs to redo.

It struggles understanding things like walls and doorways. Where they are and how they work. My tiny house has one hallway not six.

It has 3 suction settings, but you have to manually set it Every. Single. Time. So basically it only has one setting. Extremely low. It really needs to be in high for carpet. It will not self adjust at all.

It has a discharge and resume option but since it can't find the base due to map drift it usually just drives around until it dies.

It has a recharge and resume setting, except it will go recharge with a mostly full battery and then never resume. Or die somewhere random unable to find the base.

It can't pick up large dog food. Which was the main reason we needed it. The pieces jam it so now we get to sweep before we vacuum.

It doesn't edge or do corners. At all.

The filter in the unit and the filter in the base clog very quickly.

The base blows out a large blast of air when the vacuum empties. If you have pets this air will start to stink from pet dander in the container. We fixed it with a vacuum air freshening disc. But I'm assuming smell isn't the only thing it sprays out.

Zero support for the app or the vacuum beyond canned response articles. Zero change in the app or vacuum software in 8 months despite all the known issues. And since they came out with a newer model I don't expect any updates.

On the rare occasions that it works correctly having it is nice as it helps keep the house caught up. But the time invested in keeping it running I could just spend vacuuming."
1,Otherwise perfectly good product seems deliberately engineered to fail.,"This product started out working really well. Super convenient, super effective, and great with pet hair. It would occasionally become clogged or provide an error message, but I could take it apart, identify the problem, and keep cleaning.

One day I couldn’t identify the problem and so I set it aside to take it apart with the owner’s manual at hand or call tech support later.

Months went by and I one day remembered how convenient my Shark used to be and so I grabbed the manual and took a look at it. According to the error message it should be an issue with the roller bar. I removed the roller and sure enough some cat hair had accumulated at the connection point. I put it back together and we were cooking with gas! Back in action like we’d never missed a beat… unfortunately this only lasted a couple of weeks.

Cut to the same error message, but this time no detectable issues. I call tech support and they advise me to run it without the bar in place as a troubleshooting step. Problems persist. They say that means the motor that turns that little bar is shot.

Now even though the 1 year warranty had technically expired, I’d like to point out that this device had only seen ~3 months worth of consistent use. All the same, you could argue that’s my fault because if I had used it more it would have failed sooner (while still under warranty) and they would have fixed it.

That’s pretty much how I felt so I said “okay how much to repair it?” Imagine my surprise when they said that they don’t repair machines outside of warranty. No support available, not even for a fee!

They advised, instead, that I should buy a replacement. The whole thing! Even a new tower to go with it, despite the fact that my tower is (as far as I can tell) still in perfect working condition.

In fact everything on the robot itself was still operational except the bar. I’d bet dollars to donuts that it could have still done a passable job of picking up pet hair (its main purpose for me, anyway) if it wasn’t PROGRAMMED to turn into a several hundred dollar BRICK the first time any little thing breaks!

So be advised, dear reader, and prospective consumer: once you are out of warranty, the first time any little issue throws a code on your machine… you just may be at the mercy of a device that appears designed to fail."
1,Something Interrupted Getting a Clean Floor!,"I think we may be returning this vac and finding it a new home! I have purchased 4 brands of robot vacuums including this Shark and it has been hands-down the most disappointing. I tried to save money vs the Roomba i7 and I never thought I would regret doing so. But you do indeed get what you pay for! Here is where this vacuum fails and why I think I may send it back:

1. “Something has interrupted vacs cleaning”. For goodness sake something it seems is always interrupting its cleaning even though I can never seem to figure out why! One possibility is why we bought this vacuum in the first place. We have 2 large dogs and need a vacuum where the roller brush isn’t constantly getting tangled. This vacuum has a very innovative brush design - with one major flaw! Although most of the brush does not get tangled, it does get a half inch or so of a very tight wrap of hair right around the middle. And we suspect it causes it to think something like a cord has wrapped up in the brush. Maybe? I don’t know for sure but either way this vacuum NEVER finishes a job without at least once stopping and giving us the message it is interrupted. As such it can never be scheduled to run on its own as it always needs manual help to finish.

2. The app and Wi-Fi connection is the worst of the vacs. The app has a very limited feature set. For instance, despite having a mapping feature, you can’t see where the vac is on the map and you can’t create virtual barriers. Roborock vacs have a much better app in this regard. And the vacuum lost its WiFi connection twice and never reconnected. The only way I could get it to connect was to remove the vacuum and re-add it.

3. It doesn’t clean very well. It misses sections of the floor especially along certain walls allowing hair to pile up there. For some strange reason it won’t vacuum near the base so hair just starts to pile up there and has to be removed with a hand held vac. And it leaves balls of hair all throughout the house.

4. It is incredibly loud! It ties with our Roborock for the loudest vac we have owned. There is no way you can use this vac while you are doing any activity like watching TV. The Eufy vacs still win hands down on noise levels (just wish they weren’t so unreliable in finding there way back to a base).

5. It does map your floor - but it is no where near as fast and accurate at mapping rooms like other mapping vacs. It takes multiple passes and attempts before you can even get a map and then our initial map was so inaccurate we had to delete it and have it start over.

The one plus? The auto emptying base works very well. It is very powerful at removing all the contents from the vac and I like how the vac can return to base, empty it’s contents, and resume cleaning. I like this feature and will stick to other models that have this same feature.

So we are a couple of weeks away from our return date - thanks to Amazon and a great return policy! - and at this point I think the only thing preventing me from returning it is taking the time and effort to box this thing back up."
1,"Had hoped for better for the price *edit removed star, started return process)","*edit* removed a star. Been doing some testing with this vacuum and found it just kinda really sucks. My short haired dogs hair (roughly 2 inches or less) has gotten tangled up in the little roller and has caused the vacuum to make some terrible noises. I've cleaned the roller as best I could but still it sounds horrible. I'll unfortunately be returning this item. The best thing this vacuum does is get under certain things that a big vacuum can't without moving the item (couch, bed, coffee table ect). I sent the robot under my bed frame (where the dog sleeps) 7 times, after which I then moved the bed and used the large vacuum.... the small one picked up -some- dog hair each time but the larger one picked up about 20x more dog hair.... for 300 bucks I don't see the attractiveness or usefulness of this little robot. For 300, you can get a really good standard sized vacuum that can easily go under things. (FYI my large vacuum is almost 10 years old now and costed 35 bucks at Walmart when I bought it) (end edit)

This little vacuum sucks (not in the good way). I had hoped for something that'd keep the kibble my dog likes to leave around the house in check but it does a very poor job at picking them up. The vacuum also doesn't get up against walls very well at all (example: straight foot board with clumps of dog hair along it the vacuum just completely misses all the hair).
I didn't expect a full sized vacuum clean from this unit and fully expected to still break out the big vacuum weekly but I'm still disappointed.

Not sure if mine has a sensor issue or if it's normal for the vacuum to think something is in its way in the middle of the living room and stop, do a turn, go forward a bit, stop, do a turn and get back ""on track"".

Will run it a few more times and see if that fixes the issue.... (edit - after 20 or so more runs the issue still exists and is more frequent)

I'm also a bit disappointed you can't set a runtime of say 10 minutes then have it go evacuate what it's collected and then cycle clean - evacuate 10 minutes repeat.
It does do it every 30 minutes but that I feel is just too long."
1,Sucks but not in a good way,"I'm disappointed with this robot vacuum. I have a Shark upright vacuum cleaner and a handheld corded Shark vacuum cleaner. I have been a long time fan of Shark products so I did lots of research on the robot vacuums and this was listed as the top one for pets. We have 2 cats and a German Shepherd and anyone with a Shepherd knows they shed Every. Single. Minute. Of. Every. Single. Day. I was very excited to make this purchase and not have to vacuum every evening after I've spent all day at work. I was especially excited to see Shark brand had the best reviews for pets. ""Clean Latifa"" was charged fully and ready to go on her first trip around my house. I have a small house and only mapped her for 3 small rooms. She took an hour which was fine with me. After she was done, out of curiosity, I used my upright on my small livingroom area rug and my canister filled completely full of my never ending shedding dog hair. I can understand it not being 100% free of pet hair but it filled my entire upright canister 5 minutes after the robot had finished! I gave her another try the next night and still she did not pick up what should have been picked up. Baseboard areas were not clean, area rugs not cleaned and wood laminate flooring had easy to pick up pet hair that was not picked up. This product has very good reviews and this is only my opinion on the product but as of tonight Clean Latifa will be returned for my money back."
1,Parting Company,"I purchased the Shark IQ to replace a NEATO that finally, after many years and cycles of service, went to that robot vacuum cleaner home in the sky. The Shark had some big shoes to fill, but I was confident that, with the advertised features, it was well up to the task. I was, sadly, disappointed.

There are two features in a vac that are important to me. First, and most obviously, it needs to clean well. I have a black cat that leaves her fur all over the place, and a 14 year old son that's not much better about leaving a various crumbs and etc. The second feature is that the bot return to its base and resume when needed. Our house generally will take two cycles to get through because of the layout and size. Another important aspect for me was the ability to control the bot remotely. The application and wifi connectivity that came with this particular model fit that bill nicely. Finally, I needed it to be simple. In my life, I've learned that if devices are complicated, I am quickly consumed as tech support because it comes down to me having to answer questions, fix this that and the other and, frankly, after all of that, I'd just as soon get out the upright and go to work.

First, the good. Our Shark was methodical and cleaned like a pro. I watched some of it's early cycles when it looked like it would miss an area only to return and make sure that a spot was cleaned well. So, as for cleaning, no complaints. One down. Setup was easy and the application and remote control systems seemed fairly simple but, to be fair, because of the next section, which I will call ""Fatal Flaw"", I don't know how much long term ease the application provided.

Our Shark, whom we affectionately named ""Sharknado"", suffered a fatal flaw...it never once found it's way back to the base. I ran it often in hopes of getting it to develop a map of the floor but it never made a full cycle so there was no way for it to ever get a map developed. After every run, we would play ""Find the Shark"" to see where it had died. Even the application that should have alerted me to it's presence or distress was also not to be counted on.

With this, sadly, we will part company with Sharknado and search for another to fill our home with the buzz of a busy robot vacuum cleaner this year."
1,Very dumb,"Play Video
Update 2 - I wish I had taken a screenshot of the map it created prior to deleting it, and in my frustration I've since deleted the app as well. The map it produced looked like some kind of warped polygon, it had one large room and angles all over the place. Im including a map of my place from my old Neato D5, which I am using again.

Update - After struggling with this model since purchase I am giving up. I had processed a return a week ago, but didnt have access to a printer to print the label so I thought I'll give it one more chance since Amazon generously gave me until February to return the device. I have deleted 3 different ""Maps"" that it created, all of which were wildly inaccurate. Whats even more frustrating is that the daily history map is more accurate than the angular blob that was the map of my floorplan.

I even got to the point where i would turn on all my lights and monitor the device as it made its progress but it just plain sucks. My floor plan is not complicated, I live in a rectangular condo. It's not large, nor complicated. I've seen youtube videos of people with a successful map, but mine is not accurate no matter how much time and effort I put into giving this thing the best possible environment.

Im going back to my Neato D5. I may have to empty the bin daily, and get hair out of the roll every so often but it's less time and energy than I have spent on this unit. This unit seems to leave alot of hair from my dog and cat, and doesn't pick up larger items like leaves or small pieces of paper from a bandaid.

Incredibly dissapointed in this device, it's simply not ready for prime time as of December 2019. Maybe further software/firmware updates will improve it but Im done.

This device is just substandard in terms of AI and performance. It gets caught under chairs, on lamps, and all kinds of stuff. Many other devices get caught and stuck but this thing seems to be very bad at getting out of spaces. It also doesnt seem to do a very thorough job of cleaning, and the map is not correct. I've attached one of the floor plans. It vaguely matches my layout but not really, you can also see the grey areas it simply did not vacuum.

Pros
Self empty base - pretty self explanatory, it works well when the shark makes it home.

Relatively quiet - compared to my neato D 5 it's like a whisper. But based on other reviews, I would think it should be much louder. Noticeable difference between 'eco' and 'max'

Audio clues - whenever this thing has a problem it seems to announce the error in English. Like check under robot for obstruction (surprise there's nothing there!)

Cons
Incredibly, painfully, mind numbingly stupid - this thing bumps around like an old eufy I had with no navigation. Gets lost in open spaces.

Mapping seems to be camera based - what's wrong with this? It needs light to map your home and seems to consider dark spaces obstructions at times. I. E. It treated the shadow under my guest bed as if it were a wall, not going under it despite no obstructions. But it goes under my bed fine...I think. My closet light is off? It gets stuck in there, it's a small square with nothing on the floor.

Mapping seems to just suck in general - my Neato made a reasonable map on round 1, I've had to delete the map and start over on this one already. I look at its cleaning report and wonder what home it teleported to because if I squint and hold my head at a funny angle it only vaguely looks like my floor plan.

The app - at best mediocre, but honestly it's functional. I'm a tech person and I work in IT in the manufacturing industry. I'm used to klunky interfaces. My tolerance may be high for this.

I'll try and update with results from the second unit. I'm not optimistic. I'll do the final review on my pc so I can proofread and write a more thorough review."
1,Nothing but problems. Get a Roomba instead.,"I’ve had this Shark for about a year. It never had operated like stated. This is my second one because the first one I had just stopped working. They did send me a replacement which is the one I’m reviewing. I have a German Shepard and it never cleans up the hair on the rug or in the area cleaned (around 500 sq ft). Even on the heavy duty setting. It regularly has hair jammed in it that I have to clear. It does vacuum but regularly doesn’t complete the job. It will vacuum the kitchen well but when it gets to the living room it only does part of it. It then will go back to randomly vacuum other areas it had already done but won’t vacuum new spots. I’ve reset/ remapped multiple times. It will also go into one no-go area I set up and gets stuck. The worst of it is that my old dog had a big poop accident overnight. The Shark ran right into it, turned around and around it in, then spread poop over part of house. It finally got stuck on the carpet when I found it. I thought this one would avoid that but poop is all over it. I had an older Roomba and I started using that without any issues. It doesn’t self dump but I will deal with it. It very rarely gets stuck and will vacuum the whole area. Using the older Roomba versus the new Shark is night and day between performance. It’s worth the money for the Roobma."
1,Some good but absolute nogo for Carpet and Pets,"If you have hardwood floors this thing is good not great but good. The only thing to like over a roomba I3 evo is the large base that does not require bags. I have 3 dogs and the Roomba fills up those tiny bags every week.

Price - the Roomba I3 is cheaper

Carpet - the anticlog brushes definitely don’t clog up but they are very flimsy and so no good at digging dirt and hair from the carpet like roomba does. Roomba cleaned the same room on “daily cleaning” setting and picked 90% of the hair. I ran the shark 6 times and still hair.

Suction - Shark the average regular vaccum blows dyson, bissel and hoover high end models out of the water, so it’s very surprising that this vaccum barely has any suction power. I had glass sand from a weighted blanket even after 4 runs there was still some left.

Design - There is a cavity to hold large debris that the Roomba or the Shark robot picks up, The roomba sucks debris from the top of this cavity and so unless there is a piece of paper, wrapper or a wire gets in it never clogs, the shark sucks it in from the side and well it sucks, the dog hair (nothing else just dog hair) were all stuck there.

Function - the moment the Roomba is clogged and can’t clean it stops. This guy got clogged up and still was happily roaming around left me wondering why is it not cleaning.

Mapping and clean a particular room - I would say it’s better than Roomba Evo3 and much easier to use, I could care less about this feature though, I want it to clean all of my areas, doesn’t make sense to clean one and not the other. If you make a mess in a certain room it will clean the whole room and not just where you made the mess.

Corners and close to wall - Roomba despite the camera on the i7 cleans like a blind man, hits just about everything in its path. Shark turns around quarter of an inch short of the obstacles, it does come back to it but does a pretty sucky job even on larger debris. If you have hardwood floors it’s not a problem but carpets there is always more grime in closest to the walls. I have low rise carpet in the bedroom where I kept the shark. Roomba does a pretty good job on medium rise carpets as well. Thick carpet you definitely need a upright vaccum with good suction. Maybe the highest end Roomba does that job but it doesn’t make sense to me to spend 1000$ on a vaccum.

the last straw - the shark robot got stuck because of a raised carpet piece UNDER THE BED! and well it’s going back. I have ordered an I4 which has better battery compared to i3 and i7."
1,Junk - TERRIBLE PURCHASE!,"This is the worst purchase I’ve ever made! I’ve been so disappointed in this vacuum. I’ve had it just over a year now and it no longer works. When it turns on, I get an error message that the side brushes are jammed. I purchased and replaced the brushes, but they still don’t spin. When it was working, it took hours to vacuum my small ranch home, even w/two rooms closed off. It bumps into furniture and has damaged furniture and the wood trim in my home. Honestly, I’m halfway glad it stopped working so I don’t have to deal with it anymore. It would run for a while, then return to the dock to recharge, I would think it’d be done, then during lunch or dinner when I had guests, here it’d come again after what seemed like hours of being on the dock! Also, I’d have to take up several rugs each time I run it because it’d get the side brushes tangled in them or sucked up inside the machine. The harsh bumping of the furniture and wood trim around my home was my biggest issue. I put new brushes on it and it just keeps stopping after a few seconds, saying the brushes are stuck, but there is nothing sticking in them, they just won’t turn. Now I need to get everything repaired and painted and look for a new one. Save your money and look at another brand. I’ve had a couple of roombas that were okay, but I keep thinking surely there’s something better available. Fingers crossed! SAVE YOURSELF AND YOUR MONEY, THIS IS TOTAL JUNK!!!"
1,This isn’t the droid you’re looking for,"Seriously, it’s a waste of money & I’m the idiot because I didn’t try it before the return period ended.
I turn all the lights on & open the blinds so the robot has enough light. I pick up all obstacles. I use the app to start the cleaning cycle.
1. When I watch it, it does appear to clean in a grid like pattern while working it’s way around legs of furniture. However, many times it his the wall and turns but moves about six inches from the last path leaving a path of dirt. Both areas this has occurred are in the middle of the rooms and very well lit.
2. If it needs to return to the base & empty in the middle of a cycle, it goes bonkers when it returns to cleaning. The orderly sweep style stops and it just bounces from area to area (still missing the original pile I’m waiting for it to get, like it’s decided a 6” no go zone exists in the middle of the living room & dining room.
3. Vents on the side blow cat hair/dust under furniture instead of picking it up
4. After 4 months, I still can’t get it to “clean the living room” and yes, I double checked my map lines don’t overlap.
5. It doesn’t hug base boards or run around the perimeter of the room. I first noticed it in an area where I have boxes stored, & then continued to watch that it never really gets the perimeter. Back to the boxes, they are at a corner of a room and stick out into the other room by 6 inches. The robot never got the 6” strip by 3 feet for the rest of the session.
We have a Neato that cleans much better, however, it quit working with the app because we have an underscore in our Wi-Fi name (so stupid), and I’m lazy and wanted a self emptying device. I will be plugging the neato in because it doesn’t skip paths, it cleans the perimeter, the vents don’t blow dust around, it cleans in a grid like pattern.
This shark will go"
1,Surprised at how bad shark is,"I have had regular Shark Vacuums in the past and liked how they performed and never had a problem. But I cannot overstate how bad of an experience I had with this product and the technical support of shark. I got this on 4th of July weekend and set it up and it would not find any Wi-Fi networks. I got on the phone with tech support and they instructed me on how to make it find the Wi-Fi networks but even when it did that it would not connect to them. No matter how long or how many times I tried every single thing that they told me to do it would not connect to a Wi-Fi network of any kind. So 2 hours after I received this item, I had wasted an hour and a half of my holiday weekend on tech support and they still could not figure out why it was not working and was going to escalate my case. I did not spend all this money to have to deal with all this BS the second I buy the product. I will never buy a shark product again. Absolutely unacceptable that you ship me a brand new product after spending all this money and you can't even make it work the first time. I would not buy this if I was you. Go buy an iRobot or any other product, the junk that shark sells is not worth anything."
1,READ ME:,"This is my 3rd robot vac (all different brands) and is by far the WORST. I only upgraded from my roborock to get the self emptying feature. But this is not the one you want. I've had it for about 8 months and NOT ONCE....and I really mean not even one time has it found its way back to the hub. I've moved the hub 3 different times. I really don't think it would find its way back if I put it in the middle of the living room. It just quits in some random spot.

It ignores no go zones, and surprisingly gets stuck, but will also get stuck in the middle of a room. Yesterday it was against the wall and I got an error message that says that it is ""near a cliff"" or something ridiculous.

Someone else said something about its inability to follow a map of a room. I concur. It is just all over the place randomly from one room to another. I might have been spoiled with my Roborock that can map a room and go in straight lines and looks amazing when it is done. This thing does not clean thoroughly and and is certainly not worth purchasing. I did buy the Amazon insurance and am going to try to return it and get something better."
1,Nope! Horrible experience.,"I bought this vaccum in July and loved it. Loved everything about it. Then Helene hit. We lost power and internet for a week. I then spent 8 hours over the course of 4 days on the phone with the help desk trying to get it back on-line. It will no longer recognize my router, it says password incorrect. Which is not true. The last tech support fellow, even sent me a beta app for this issue and informed me that if the power is out more than 3 hours this will happen again, if I don't download the spectrum app and change my router password. That was all a bridge to far for me. 2 more hours on the phone to change more passwords load more apps and for nothing. I didn't need the spectrum app when I install it fresh from the box and The password wasn't a problem then either and he could t tell me why now. I asked them to replace my 3 month old robot and they were not willing. This thing is very expensive, unsupportable, hot garbage. I'm going to buy a Hoover now."
1,No go zones don't mean no go - DONT BUY THIS,"I have tried to like this vacuum so much... but I can honestly say after my experience with tech support today that I'll never buy another shark/ninja product for my home. Every morning I wake up and my vacuum has gotten stuck in the rug under my king size bed, I've tried setting a no go zones, I've tried stacking multiple no go zones on top of each other, I've tried building a barricade on the rug and remapping the house so the vacuum doesn't even know this space exists, ive deleted and reinstalled the robot in the app and remapped the whole house with my barricade up and today I spent 40 minutes on a video call with shark tech support only to have them tell me that they would call me back tomorrow to continue to troubleshoot this further... Beyond this the app is complete crap, you cannot set a no go zone smaller than 12' x 12' (yes FEET, not inches, FEET) you also can't designate a ""room"" and smaller than 9' x 9', so while it gives you an option to name something a hallway... unless your hallway is 9' wide x 9' long it has to be lumped in with a room. Even after doing everything tech support suggested today the robot still makes a hard left and heads roght under the king size bed and then the side brush gets stuck in the rug, meaning I have to pull my mattress off the frame to try to rescue my AI robot from the place it has gotten stuck every day since I've owned it (approx 1 month at this point). When I purchased this I assumed with the AI it would learn not to go certian places if it's gotten stuck there before? No because not only has this gotten stuck under the bed every day for 30 days, it's also successfully wedged itself under my entertainment center and MOVED IT AWAY FROM THE WALL approx 2' before announcing it was stuck and required assistance. Never again Shark, never again"
1,Updated review,"UPDATE:
Robot vacuum stopped functioning properly after about 1 months. Wouldn't run it's scheduled routine and wouldn't remap. After several attempts I contacted the Sharkninja help desk. First getting Chat Bot which proved worthless. First human was not any better than chat bot. Elevate! Wait 24 hours Second human, yep it's not working. Elevate wait 48 hours because it's now a Saturday. Thursday contact help desk again, trouble ticket is wrong, wants to start process over which involves video link through my phone . Already done this twice not doing it again. He says hang on has to call another department. Finally they get the right answers and will replace under 1 year warranty. $25.00 for prepaid return Mailer. No I say I'm not paying to return it under warranty. Wait..ok we'll pay for shipping.

Warranty on shark website says they will send a prepaid mailer. But, the phone number listed to call doesn't work.

Help Desk person said the note said they tried to call on Tuesday. They left no VM and didn't bother to follow up with any email to give me a status.

Customer Service at Shark gets zero stars.

Waiting on the new robot asnof this writing.

Original Review
Especially at the sale price this Shark robot vacuum is fantastic. Runs on a schedule, cleaning about 900sq feet about 2 hours. Goes over transition strips with rellitive ease."
1,Disappointed. Unimpressed. 😟,"Play Video
I added a video that shows why I am very dissatisfied with this item. It said it goes in straight lines to map and clean, it started that way, but after 1 back and forth the next time it stopped in the middle of the carpet for no reason and went another direction. It went beneath my chair 4 different times. However, it never ventured under my sofa, after I got down and moved all of the crap that was beneath it. It went under my coffee table once, but as soon as it was completely under it, it spun around a few times and shot back out & never went back. It did not go between my sofa and coffee table, which is one of the area most in need of a vacuum. Oh yes, and the area it did cover, it did not do a good job of picking up debris. I have a 10 month old who just started to crawl & she eats every speck she can pick up off the floor, she also cries when I vacuum, so this was supposed to be the solution: a vacuum that runs while we’re out & ensures that I can set her down on her play mat & when she inevitably ventures off the mat, I won’t find her gagging on a random pine needle or other debris she’s encountered. But, alas, this vacuum doesn’t suck and that’s a problem. It covered some areas multiple times while totally avoiding others for seemingly no reason. I’ve had this thing for weeks now, without the time to set it up. Today it was do or die, so whilst the baby howled from her high chair, I set it up. We stood and watched from behind the baby gate in the next room as the vacuum whirled and made a totally random and incomplete trip around the living room, neglecting the areas most in need of cleaning and tripling up on other areas. *sigh* very disappointing. I do NOT recommend this product. I do recommend watching my video."
1,Here’s why I returned this vacuum:,"After a week with this robot, I’d had enough and decided to return it. About half of the runs ended up being cut short because it would get stuck, but although I had notifications turned on, it rarely notified me of getting stuck. One time, it went into a room, closed the door, then sat in a corner all day. When I found it, hours later, I pushed the button for it to return to the dock, but it refused to do so. The app showed that it was returning, the light on the robot indicated it was going to the dock, but it just kept going room to room, cleaning. I had to turn it off and carry it back to the dock.

It only ever “cleaned” the whole house once, out of a half dozen runs, and that took about 7 hours! Cleaned is in quotes because it did a terrible job. I watched it go under the couch a few times, but when I looked under there it was still dusty. I ran my regular vacuum under there and it picked up a bunch of stuff. The robot also damaged part of the baseboard in my kitchen.

The dock is a great idea, but not great in execution. The robot would usually have to back up onto it a couple times before it could make a good connection. It’s quite loud when emptying into the dock, about like a normal tank style vacuum. The detachable canister is easy enough to remove from the dock, and not too bad to put back on, if you line it up right, but emptying it into the trash is a pain. Maybe it was just mine, but I pushed the button on the side to empty it and nothing happened. I had to hold the button with one hand and grab the bottom with the other and then kind of pop it open. I tried to clean it out as best I could before returning it, but they really should have gone the route of putting a bag in there.

The software is terrible. Connecting it to wifi was a pain. The email verification process is broken. The app sometimes decides to stop talking to the robot. The map just keeps asking if it looks like what was cleaned, no matter how many times I hit the thumbs up. The map also says it’s about 2400 square feet, even though my house is only about 1550. One time it said it cleaned -1 square feet, and had a blurry line for the map, but it actually ran through a couple rooms.

The worst part, though, is their support. They absolutely refuse to even talk to you unless you give them a bunch of personal information that they really don’t need. When I would tell them that they don’t need my home address and phone number in order to fix the login on their website, they would apologize and then say that as soon as I gave them the info they would open a ticket. This was all through Twitter. Maybe phone support is less useless.

I had actually considered replacing my Dirt Devil tank vacuum with a Shark, but after this experience, I think I’ll be looking at other brands."
1,DO NOT BUY!!! STICK TO ROOMBA!!,"First let me say, I never actually take the time to review anything and buy almost anything and everything I can from Amazon. This will be my first (and probably my only review). This robot is so bad I had to stop and make myself take the time to review it so no-one else gets suckered into this.

I bought this a few months ago. It took about a month to kind of map out the house, but still to this day it doesn't do a good job of actually cleaning all the rooms. My entire house is all the same level, all laminate and tile, and normal obstacles to overcome for a robot vacuum (dining room chairs, couch, beds, etc). That being said, it pretty much cleans the same room over and over.

Also, amazon shows that it has a home mapping feature where it will map out your home and you can send it to one specific room to clean. After an hour on the phone with a Shark representative, they told me that this model does not have a mapping feature. No one at Shark or Amazon are willing to take it back as a return.

The main problem this has, is finding the base. It takes up to 15 minutes sometimes to actually dock so it can empty out and go back to vacuuming the house. It basically roams around the dock over and over looking for the dock. The battery goes dead half the time because it can't find the dock. It will even venture into other rooms looking for the dock. I've done all the trouble shooting, taken it apart and cleaned everything to a T, and even placed the dock within 10 feet of the internet router. Nothing works. I called Shark, they did a video call to watch it dock and of course on that specific day it pretty much docked after a few tries. They told me it can take up to 5 minutes of roaming around to dock! Which basically kills the battery trying to dock rather than actually cleaning the home.

Overall, STICK TO ROOMBA!! Shark as always been good for me with vacuums so I gave them a try on my first robot vacuum. $500 later, lesson learned....will not be buying shark brand from here on out!"
1,Prime Day is coming…DON’T DO IT!!!,"Bought this as a Prime Day deal in November ‘22; it’s now July of ‘23 and this thing hasn’t worked right for MONTHS! I’ve troubleshooted until I’m “blue in the face.” …it all started with hair wrapped around the orange clip thing of the roller (the part that’s tucked inside)…. It was now throwing an error, so, we initially weren’t sure what was wrong (I did clean the roller but didn’t open it up). It’s honestly had every problem; it stopped reading the map…it would go in blocked off areas and get caught…

I deleted the map and tried to try again, but, it wouldn’t map our house properly (even after I installing the app and reinstalling it). So, I moved the dock…tried again; still wouldn’t map it. Tried again; after 3 failed map attempts again, I just kept blocking from going back to the dock, until it mapped my 1500 square foot house. I picked up EVERYTHING it could potentially get caught on…yet, it still managed to say it was stuck (even though it wasn’t stuck when I found it).

After I finally got the map, I blocked off and named my areas, and sent it out to vacuum! It would go out, do one strip, and then beep, return to dock.

I called customer service; I spent 45 minutes trying by to tell the lady what my problems had been, but, she just kept “giving me suggestions” to do things I had already done… she connected via video and I proved to her what it was doing. I think I’m getting a replacement…but I had a really hard time understanding her English.

Please don’t waste your life away like I have mine… my house would be much cleaner right now if I just vacuumed myself and didn’t have this fancy gadget to do it for me…"
1,Absolutely not!!!,"I bought this product in March 2023. I had an Eufy before that worked pretty good, but didn't have the self emptying bin. I bought this one based on the positive reviews. I have no idea how in the world these reviews are accurate. It had to be replaced in April because it would consistently stop in the middle of the floor. It has never been that good at cleaning. Always some debris was left behind. I don't expect it to be 100% perfect, but for double the cost of my other one you would think it would be at least pretty good. Fast forward to November of 2023, I keep getting an error code that there was debris on the bottom (error code 2 I believe). I clean the machine at least once a week and I didn't see anything. I then called their customer service. I had to do a video call so they could watch the machine. After that, the representative advises that it is a problem with the brush. She said that it costs $21.99 plus shipping. I about lost it. 7 months after I bought the machine the roller breaks and they want me to pay for it. It has a ""limited"" 1 year warranty. Make sure you focus on the limited. She said the warranty covers the machine and not the parts. After advising that I would be going on social media to share this story, they suddenly agreed to send it to me free of charge. BTW, my wife also has a shark hair dryer and stopped using it because it will randomly not work. Never again will I buy a shark product and I advise strongly that you don't either."
1,Not ready for prime time,"I purchased this product during the holiday season since it was on sale even though I wouldn't need it for a few months while my house was being built. Five months later I started using the vac.
Reliability - After 4 runs, one of the wheels broke. Shark promptly sent me a new vac. Customer Service was very good. I've now had the new vac for about a month and have run it 14 times. Here are my results.
Suction - It does well on hardwood and tile but is not so great on our rugs. Lots of rug bunnies left behind and unless the debris is sitting right on top, it doesn't seem to pick it up. Regarding suction, I purchased the self emptying base and I would say, it is the best feature of the product.
Boundary Strips - Both vacuums have gotten stuck on boundary strips or just went right over them. I've tried other brands of strips and it happens with them as well. By the way, I thought I would have to have lay the strips down just a few times and then it would learn to not go there. I was wrong. You have to lay them down every time you vacuum (I don't like leaving them out all the time). This makes scheduling a bit of a challenge if you want it to run the vac while your at work. Just a note, make sure you put boundary strips around the floor lamps. It will crawl right on top of the base and scratch it and/or get stuck. I think this is what caused the first vacuum to break. Of course, this may still happen even with the strips around it the lamp as was my case.
Mapping - I still haven't figured out the logic behind how it learns your house. It vacuumed the same area which is about 10 sq. ft. five times this morning. I think what happens in some instances is that when it changes to and from the rugs (or runs on top of a floor lamp) it looses its sense of direction. Some times, it will stay in one spot for about a minute just banging its ""head"" against a wall. Spin-bang, spin-bang, etc. It's like an old LP getting stuck in a groove.
Overall - It's fun to watch the first few times and you'll get some entertainment out of it but the novelty wears off quickly and then you just want it to do its job. In my opinion, it doesn't do it very well. You cannot just schedule and leave because more than likely, it will probably get stuck or confused. Definitely not worth the money I spent. I would gladly spend twice as much if the thing would work properly. Maybe I'll go for a Roomba."
1,Mapping Failure,"First the pros: Good price, vacuums under furniture like ottomans, beds, bookcases, chairs, china cabinets and dressers, has 3 power modes and the user can stop the machine by using the app pause or dock buttons. Once you have a map you can label it with rooms and send the robot to clean whatever room you want, when you want and you can schedule cleanings in the app. It also empties itself when it docks. The concept is good but the execution on the concept is a total failure.

The cons: I have a single story 2,000 sq ft house that the Shark IQ can't map before the battery needs to be recharged in normal and eco modes. Using the Recharge and Resume setting, the Shark IQ finally made a map of my house but it turned out to be 4,000 sq feet the first time. It got that large because the Shark likes to clean the same area over and over without moving on to the next area. It also misses some areas altogether. I called Shark Support 6-10 times in the month I have had it. I was told to delete the map and start over, which I did. The second map was 6,000 sq ft and I never did figure out what each room on the map was. The robot and charging station require a ridiculous amount of flooring to work (3 feet of open space on each side of the charging station, and 3 feet in front of it). We had to remove a large area rug just to find a space where it would work. What would have made this robot workable was a manual override option to redirect the robot when it spun around in circles, could not figure out how to get out of a tight space or repeatedly went in the wrong direction, or went to clean the wrong room. Most upsetting today, the robot refused to clean the room I sent it to after it had cleaned that room several times before. It also ran over the boundary strips and sucked up my computer cord, then it tried to run over its charging station. Also, it couldn't find its way back to the charging dock, so I had to stop it and carry it back to the dock for it to find it. This happened many times in the last two weeks. The last time I spoke to tier 2 support at Shark they told me to delete the map again and try to create a new map but had no solution for the fact that the Shark will clean the same area repeatedly without moving on to the next room when making the map, other than to pause it and move it two inches, which doesn't work.

Lastly, we tested how well it cleans by using a dry swiffer mop on the bathroom floor which is smooth tile after the Shark vacuumed it in Max mode, and I was surprised to see how much dirt the swiffer picked up. I will be returning the unit."
1,Nice when it worked...for a week....,"I received this product on 1/13/2021, set up was easy and I loved it for a week. After a week I kept getting an error 2 message, I eventually replaced the side brushes and that fixed it for a day and then repeated error 2 messages, called tech support. They were very nice but couldn't fix it and said they'd send me a replacement but they wanted to charge me $25 for shipping. I said absolutely not, I'd had it less than 3 weeks and they waived the shipping. I waited a week, received the new one today, set it up and it won't charge. I called tech support, they tried to troubleshoot, couldn't fix it and said they'd send me a new one. Once again they tried to charge me to ship the replacement, I refused, they waived it. I said I appreciate a replacement but this will be 3rd vacuum in a month and asked what they were going to do to assure I get a functional one and the only assurance I received was ""well, it has to"". She said ""good news, it's in stock"" and I'd have it in 3-10 business days and to send info to a support email. I sent exactly what she instructed me to do, they replied saying they needed more info, which I then sent. I was then told it was out of stock (which I'd been assured 30 min prior it was in stock) and that they anticipate it in the warehouse in 3 weeks and then it'll be sent to me. So now I'm stuck waiting likely another month for my 3rd replacement on a vacuum I spent roughly $500 on 3 weeks ago. When the vacuum worked it was awesome, but how does a company repeatedly keep sending duds, apologize, try to charge me shipping on their defective product, give me bad info on when I'll get it (off by a month), and when I ask for assurances the 3rd one will work I get a confidence inspiring ""well, it has to"".

I guess I'll wait for vacuum #3 to arrive by spring and hope my third unit actually works...but I'm not feeling real confident and not impressed with the Shark brand's product or nice on the surface but completely ineffective customer service.

UPDATE: I decided within 4 hours of my last contact with support to just cancel the 3rd one and return for a refund to Amazon so I can try a different brand. Easy enough, right? No. The customer service people that told me it'd be 3 weeks before they had them in the warehouse, said they actually had it in stock and it'd already shipped! So now I get to return the original and the replacement that they couldn't send for 3 weeks that actually shipped in about 6 hours. I have other Shark vacuums and love them, but I'm ready to be done with them!"
1,Get a Roomba i6 instead. The Shark is garbage.,"***Edit*** after just a month now, it has died completely. Anytime the unit hits it's front bumper against something, it gives an error message saying something is stuck under it.

I bought a Roomba i6+ to replace it. It literally has none of the issues this thing has. It doesn't hit things so hard, doesn't get stuck everywhere, the clean room feature works, it makes it's way back to the base every single time, and it cleans much better! Don't waste your money on this junk. Spend a little more and get a much, much better machine instead.
----------------------------------------------------

Pros: Uses the map of your house to completely clean your home. Picks up where it left off after emptying the bin or charging the battery. Does a pretty good job picking up things from the floor, cleans the entire floor, nice that empties itself into the bin.

Cons: Runs over things, pushes lighter things around or knocks them over, ""clean specific rooms"" feature doesn't work correctly (cleans the wrong rooms), anti hair wrap feature doesn't work (see picture), doesn't always find it's way back to charging dock.

We have a Cordey, and with it's random pattern, it doesn't always clean the entire floor. It misses spots. I bought this on Amazon Day for half off after watching the video comparing this to the Roomba version, where they recommend the shark after testing.

First, this thing hits stuff way too hard. I have two acoustic guitars on stands and it pushes them around. It knocked over a potted plant one day. It tries to go over anything over and inch high on the floor. Often, it accomplishes this. It bumps into furniture hard! The Cordey, which is much cheaper than this, has a much better sensor system. It doesn't hit things really hard, doesn't move things and didn't try to climb over things it should be going around.

After vacuuming the house a few times, it married the house. The drawing looks pretty accurate but not completely so. I labeled the rooms and tried several times to clean specific rooms, but it cleans the wrong rooms and then returns to the dock and chimes that it's finished. So obviously this feature doesn't work.

It does do a good job of picking up dog fur, dust and debri from the floor but even small candy wrappers get stuck in the shoot when the vacuum docks and unloads to the base. The Cordey actually picks up as much or more. The anti-hairwrap feature clearly doesn't work. See the attached picture. I have to cut the fur off weekly. No different than the cheaper Cordey.

Overall, I feel like this is clunky and unrefined, especially for the price this cost, and when compared to how a much cheaper brand outperforms it for cleaning, sensing objects, and battery performance.

Shark missed the mark greatly here."
1,Stopped cleaning all the rooms and will not remap the house,Bougth the vacuum at the end of June. Unit worked great for two months. Then it stopped cleaning all the rooms on the map. Tried to remap the house and the unit will not do that now. Called customer support and then they tried to pass me to another agent who did not answer. That agent was supposed to call me back within the next 48 hours but it took 4 days. After several transfers finally got a technician that had to do a video call to watch my unit malfunctioning. My case was then passed to the software group. After waiting several more days they contacted me and had another video call to watch my unit malfunction. I was told I would need to send it back for replacement. This was now the middle of September. 10/13 I received an email that my order was cancelled and I would be refunded on 5-10 days. After 13 days I have no refund. Called again today and now have to wait 3-5 days for an email from a supervisor. Frustrating customer service and response.
1,Waste of money - do not buy if you have lots of pet hair,"I bought this to replace a cheap robovac that finally died. Loved the upgrade on this one that it self emptied. Well what a complete waste of money! Pet hair clogs it up pretty quickly. It actually deposits tufts of per hair on edges of rugs etc. they are actually worse after vacuuming. It’s supposed to not have to be cleaned or emptied for a month, but I have to clean it every time it runs. It does a decent job on just dirt on hard floors, but seems to do next to nothing on my rugs, and like I said, actually leaves rugs dirtier. I wish I could return it or sell it. The only reason I haven’t just tossed it in the trash is because it was so expensive. Don’t waste your money if you have shedding pets!!"
1,"Review from an iRobot Early Adopter (Yes, it's been years)","Update:
The app continues to be a frustration. As for the vacuum, it started to clean by itself randomly. I have been ignoring them until it starts to vacuum our bedroom in the middle of the night, when we are sleeping! This is absolutely unacceptable as the noise it generates is louder than an alarm! And there's no email support and that's unacceptable!

When I first saw the ad for this product, I know I have to get this as it has all the features that overcome my gripes on my iRobot. The fact that it has a self-empty base, and the fact that the vacuum has the ability to return to the base to empty the debris before it continues with the rest of the floor, the fact that it is able to sweep through the same space multiple times, and the fact that it is able to show you the area it covers on the app are all features that overcome the inherent shortcomings of my previous iRobot which, comparatively, was a dumb robot.

I ran this manually last Sunday, scheduled to run Mon-Fri daily when nobody's home and, so far, for 2 days I am happy to report that it works without a hitch! No more dusty floor underneath the furniture, no need to manually empty the vacuum everytime like my former iRobot have to, no need to blindly trust the random nature of the sweeping motion inherent of iRobot as Shark's sweeping motion is logical and systematic and, get this, no need to clean the brush and disentangle the hair from the brushes everytime (again, like my iRobot) because of its well-thoughtout design.

However, nothing is perfect. Here are 3 minor app issues which I hope they can fix: -
1) the ability to change WiFi or its password without the need to do the setup again,
2) the ability to detect and reconnect to hidden WiFi, and
3) the incredible time lag to command the vacuum through the app. It takes 3-5 minutes to run/dock the vacuum through the app. Luckily, we don't really have to do that as you can just press a physical button on the vacuum or to run it on schedule like I do.

Fix the above and I'll upgrade to this review to a 5-star!

Hopefully, the vacuum will last quite a few years like my iRobot did. If so, Shark would have gained a loyal customer especially if they keep up with its quality (hardware and software), innovation and reasonable price-point. I might just have to buy a couple more for the different rooms depending on how well this continues to work out!

For now, thank you, Shark Ninja!"
1,Doesn’t work and customer service is entirely unhelpful,"It doesn’t work on pet hair for carpets which is the main reason I purchased. It then stopped working all together and after a very unhelpful 30 minute wait listening to the most annoying voice recording I have ever heard approximately 100 times, a very unhelpful person informed me it was my fault for not knowing that in addition to regularly cleaning the brush roll I’d have to also pull out the pin which was stuck to its base. Because I ordered this thing on AMAZON shark wouldn’t replace the brush roll so after spending over $300 on a machine that is over $500 full price, I will have to replace the brush roll for a vacuum cleaner that doesn’t work for the primary purpose I purchased it for. 0 stars. I guess I’ll get one of the even move expensive robots next time. Very frustrating experience with the shark brand and I will not be purchasing any of their products in the future."
1,I regret this purchase.,"Did a lot of research on smart robot vacuums before picking up this Shark IQ R101AE. I think I preferred my previous Roomba 690 that just bounced around like an idiot.

The Shark IQ R101AE has 2 rotating brushes on the front. Only one of them works right now. Nothing happened to the robot, the right side brush just stopped working. Which means the entire vacuum is no longer usable. It will go about 10 seconds before it realizes that side brush isn't doing anything, and then stops and gives an Error 2 and forces you to fix it. The screw for servicing that rotating brush isn't standard (they were on the Roombas), so I can't take it off to see what's happening. I can push it around freely, which sometimes helps. If I stay by the Shark for a while, and just keep randomly picking it up, nudging the side rotating brush, and set it down and try again, every once in a while it seems to catch and starts spinning again. Then the Shark will merrily continue on its way doing its job. But this babysitting to get it started (sometimes works first try, sometimes takes fifteen minutes) means you can't just set-it-and-forget-it.

Dealing with that, once it gets going it does the job well enough. Except the room mapping feature. I need this thing to stop trying to go under the couch. Allegedly I could just let it map out the room, then draw virtual boundaries around the couch to keep it from spending the rest of its life stuck under the sofa. Except, it won't finish the mapping of the house. The app says ""It takes your robot a few runs to make sure it explores your entire home."" Though ""a few runs"" in this case seems to mean at least twenty. More vacuum babysitting. It says it's at ""31% completion level"" and this robot ""smart"" vacuum has completed around 2 dozen trips throughout the house. It doesn't tell you exactly how many runs or trips it thinks it's completed, just that completion percentage, so maybe I'm over estimating how many trips its completed. I'm really just guessing, judging by how often in the past 3 months I've felt up to the task of fussing with the brush to get it working again.

TL;DR - This robot still hasn't mapped out the house so I can tell it to avoid going under the couch and I have no idea how many times I have to babysit it until it does. Also, the side brush stopped working, so I have to fuss with it to get it to start."
1,Lasted Less Than a Month,"This was my second shark, the first one didn't have the features I wanted and despite difficulties with their terrible app I decided to go for this one. When it works it works well, it doesn't have amazing suction or cleaning availability but it does a decent enough job and the map works well enough even if it is harder to use than other lesser known brands. I don't like that you can't see exactly where there's robot is on the map but the bigger problem is that after 3 weeks it stopped working entirely.

The robot constantly says that there's debris stuck in it despite being completely clean and empty, you can do a full factory reset and it'll work for a few days but then it goes back to the same issue, completely disabling the vacuum.

Update: with no help from Shark I was able to figure out that hair can get inside the spinning side of the roller resulting in the above error despite no obvious obstruction or change in resistance. I was able to get it working again but need to check the roller every other day, and it broke the second time I had to clean it. Since then it works, but continues to clog frequently, and fails to pull debris inside the machine consistently, further complicating things and requiring more maintenance. My old vacuum couldn't self empty and was louder, but I didn't have to do nearly as much maintenance, just emptying. I'm not sure that the trade off is worth it

Update 7/23: I figured out that you can schedule cleaning of specific rooms using Google assistant, this allows the Shark to empty itself before it gets full. It started working well for a couple months doing this until last week. Suddenly the Shark has a low suction error. Despite replacing all consumable parts and filters the machine still shows a low suction error. It's once again effectively dead. The machine cannot be used.

To make it worse, Shark's warranty sucks. They will cover the cost of shipping your unit to them, but they want you to pay for shipping back. Ridiculous to have to sink more money into a defective product."
1,"BEWARE! Lots of bugs, and hardware issues.","Really wanted to like this vacuum. But there are several things wrong with it.
First, the wifi connection works maybe a quarter of the time. I will try to connect to the vacuum from the same network or from work and the majority of the time it says ""Can not connect to vacuum"".
Second, it hardly ever runs on its scheduled times. I was suspicious when our floors started getting progressively more dirty thinking that the vacuum was working correctly, only to find out that it never ran. THEN when I would start the vacuum by hand, it would run for maybe 5 min then return home, and empty itself. This has happened several times.
With almost a month of usage, dumping the large bin, there was barley any dirt or derby. My ecovacs would pick up easily 10X more than this vac has.
Third, I have noticed that when I run the vac in person, it no longer is sucking up things. You only hear the brush moving slowly. This was noticeable, because when this vac was actually working as designed, it was INSANELY loud. Which at first, I could care less. I add this as a pro thinking that more sound was due to more suction and better cleaning, and since I would run this when I am not home it didnt matter to me. But now that I hear how quiet it is, and checking to make sure nothing is clogging any lines, I am guessing the unit is defective.

Again, I REALLY wanted to like this vacuum but it just simply does not work. Maybe Shark will come out with a newer version down the road, but I am really disappointed in the product Shark put out for the moment. Maybe this is a lemon, but I have read these issues are common for this unit. The software in and of its self is a mess. No idea what the remote control feature was, I never saw that in the app. The map seems to be doing an ok job, but after a month of use, its still not letting me choose rooms to clean. So it sounds like the problems are 60% hardware and 40% software. It would be helpful if the app would actually tell you why the vac keeps dropping wifi or cant connect. For a small apartment where wifi covers it fully there is no excuse. No one should have to go in and change a bunch of permission and security settings on their router either to troubleshoot this thing. Its 2019, write some good software that works Shark

Will update this if there are any changes."
1,JUNK,"DO NOT BUY! This robot has been abysmal in cleaning, mapping, and challenges. The company replaced all the inners (battery, etc.) WITHIN THE FIRST 30 DAYS. They even said that since I bought the warranty from Amazon, their warranty was null and void, which is ridiculous. They also charged for the new parts. I called for support when it started ignoring the map settings AGAIN. I was told they would transfer me. Seven minutes into the call with the same person, they asked me a question about the version of the app. There had been an update the day prior, I was unaware and I asked them if this would fix the problem. They said no, they would have to transfer me (second time they have said this to me). I continued to wait, and they never transferred me to a technician to help. After 10 minutes, I gave up. DON'T BUY IT DOESN'T WORK, AND THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS NON-EXISTENT!"
1,A stain on the name Shark,"I wanted to love this vacuum. I own a Shark Upright that has been amazing. I have a Shark Vac and Mop which is awesome. I went with this Robot not because of the lower price point but for the name. Sadly I made a mistake.

Set up was easy. I had no issues linking to WiFi or keeping it connected. I work in IT and Networking so that could be in part due to my network. I was very impressed with how well it cleaned and the noise level was great. Where I ran into problems was with the mapping.

I did everything to babysit this thing to ensure a proper map. Made sure all clutter was off the floor, had my kitchen chairs up, even attached feet to my coffee table so it could easily maneuver my living room. I kept all lights on and put door stops under each door just in case.

After around 20 cleaning runs I still did not have a complete map. It would go into every room but still no map. Then rooms would just vanish from the progress and the history. It finally got to the point where I no longer had a hallway, bedrooms or bathrooms as you can see in the last picture. It cleaned the living room, kitchen and office twice because of this.

We reset the map, tried again. We turned off recharge/resume and evacuate/resume. I actually had a map populate after only 2 runs! Except... my sons room did not exist, nor did half of our guest room or our living room. The map it came up with didn't even match its history map it just ran! I reset the map one more time and it completely avoided the living room. You can see in the images I have attached how drastically different the ""maps"" this thing would come up with.
Customer service was absolutely horrible. They just advised to reset the map.

Another thing to note was since I had finally gained a usable map I figured I would try to create a room. It was awful. You drag this square around a miniaturized ""map"" of your house and have to try to size it to create ""rooms"". I wanted to try to create just one ""room"" but gave up due to how frustrating the interface was.

I am returning this tomorrow, already ordered a Roborock. Hopefully Shark can get their robot vacuums figured out. It almost felt like they rushed this out to compete with the Roomba and skipped all QC."
1,Worked beautifully for about 2 weeks & hasn't worked right since,"This vacuum worked beautifully for about 2 weeks & hasn't worked right since. I had it scheduled to run each morning on my main level & all was fine until it started throwing out an error code about 2 weeks in. I took the roller out, cleaned it off (even though it was not at all jammed as the error was indicating) and it still wouldn't run. I ordered a kit of replacement parts thinking maybe the roller that it came with was bad and it worked again for maybe 3-4 days then the same error came up. Took everything apart, cleaned again & now its just a pricey floor decoration because it will not run due to the ""jammed roller"" that is not jammed at all."
1,Terrible Warranty and Customer Service,"Play Video
Update (6/22/2020): Only after filing a complaint with the BBB did I finally get a call from Shark offering to replace my robot. I immediately shipped the defective robot to Shark that day. A month later I still have not received my replacement. I've called twice to check on the replacement and I was told both times it was on its way to arrive in 3-5 business days. I called again today and I got the same answer. I began this process in April and it is nearly July and still no replacement.

Previous review:

Shark Ninja apparently does not do warranty repairs or replacements on their robots or it is nearly impossible to initiate a warranty repair. From what I understand from the customer service reps at Shark Ninja, customer service does not have ability to initiate the warranty repair process and they seem to have no ability to ask anyone else to initiate this process. How does a warranty work if you cannot return the device to be repaired or replaced?

My robot is behaving erratically and cannot perform its tasks as advertised. I have spent weeks on the phone with customer service attempting to get my robot repaired or replaced with zero response or resolution. In fact, my case was closed because they “did not receive the video” of the issue even though Shark Ninja sent me a reply to the email asking me to complete a customer service survey.

I have spoken with several customer service reps (after 40 min wait each time) and they tell me someone will call me with a resolution in 24-48 hrs, but it has been a month and no call or resolution from Shark Ninja. I have attempted to escalate the issue, but the customer service reps tell me there is no way to do that. If you try to call Shark Ninja headquarters you just get routed back to the same customer service reps that can't do anything but tell you that you will get a call in 24-48 hours.

It worked fine (with a few wifi connection hiccups) for 5 months then it started to have issues. The video shows the robot trying to dock but it can't... it will do this behavior over and over until it dies."
1,Almost worthless,"I'm going to be as honest as possible in this review, so I will preface this whole thing by saying I absolutely hate this thing. It really is almost more work than just getting a vaccum and vacuuming your whole house a couple times a week. I live in Florida, so I have sandy soil that gets tracked in from my two dogs when they play. The Shark is actually incapable of picking up the sand on the highest setting, so that has to be vacuumed with a real vacuum anyway.

Even if it could pick it up, I doubt it would get to the areas that have it the worst. I will often see this vacuum stay in a room for up to an hour, doing the same area over and over instead of doing anywhere else. If you want it to do a specific area, you'll have to set it in that area and establish a perimeter of magnetic boundary strips so it doesn't disappear to another place.

It is supposed to auto dock, yes, but it often doesn't. It will glow green like it's going to the dock, but continue ""vaccuming"" anyway. Going through the whole house with the suction turned off until it dies. I have run it in the evening before I go to sleep before, just to wake up and have to search the house for the vaccum which has died under a bed, or a couch, or some other inconvenient location.

Now the app. The app that you need to use with this is worse than the hardware itself, which I'm sure was incredibly hard to accomplish. It's slow and sluggish, and most of the features it boasts don't even work. Is your vaccum stuck somewhere and you can't find it? Too bad, because the bot locate feature has worked maybe two or three times in the year plus since I got this vaccum. Has your bot mapped your home and now you've set up rooms for it to vaccum? That's too bad, because even if you launch it to vacuum the kitchen, it'll do whatever else it wants to anyway. Even if this feature did work, it eventually stops giving you the option in the app, and you have to either uninstall it or factory reset the vacuum to remap your whole home from scratch.

Now for carpet. It barely works on carpet. It has only been able to pick up my GSD's hair from hard flooring, but doesn't do anything to carpet. Running a real vacuum over a carpeted area will yield a metric ton of fur, while the boy vacuum will yield nothing.

There's probably far more to say about this, but these are the major issues in my experience over the past year. Spend the extra money and buy an iRobot."
1,Shark Really messed up here. AVOID,"Right Out of the box i could not get the Vaccume running due to Error 6. (bumper obstacle). After searching online i decided to open the front bumper screws and realign the hardware. QA process clearly had it installed incorrectly and the bumper clips were not set correctly. Got the unit to work after doing this.

Asides from that here is the biggest problem.. THE APP - Its absolutely horrible, the hardware of the unit is capable of a lot but paired with this app makes it impossible to use.

1) Mapping- I have done 10+ runs to map the house and it just cant seem to figure it out. After mapping i am not able to make edits or modifications or send the vacuumed out again to add on to the maps. You have to delete and start over hoping it gets everything. If it does not map your house there is no way to have it vacuumed the unmapped parts like under the sofa or around the chair.. Weird...
2) Schedule - So you can schedule just like every other vaccume but this one seems to go out on its run and come back home sometimes within 1 minute thinking its done.. The whole house is not running and regardless or how many times i try it just refuses to do the whole house.

I feel like i have spent more time to make this work rather than make my life easier with automation. I really like the hardware and there is potential so tried calling Shark Support which felt like a 30 minute waste of my life, I got transferred to someone outside of the US and it took over 30 minutes to spell out my name and email address to her, I just gave up and decided to return the product.

In Conclution, Please avoid this product - you can read your reviews on forums about this and more issues, Shark support is not going to help so i dont think its worth spending $400 on a product that you have to babysit to work.. Get something else."
1,Failed twice “bumper stuck” error twice. Had trouble with no go areaset up,"Updated review again:

The robot has failed with “bumper is stuck” error message again. The first one I got had this same error and they replaced the unit. I had to pay $100 shipping.

The replacement failed with the same problem within 60 days. Again, they are sending me a replacement after extensive trouble shooting on FaceTime so I could show that I cleaned every part and it still doesn’t work.

The mapping of this unit is terrible. You have to let the robot map the areas that you don’t want it to go in before you can exclude them. Simply blocking off the areas does not work. I am do frustrated! They need to fix this error.

I had a problem setting up the no go areas.

No go areas must be set up after the robot maps the rooms. That includes the rooms you don’t want it going into. That means that the no go areas must fit within the grey boundaries on the map. I have an area that has only a 2 inch step, which the robot can’t see because it’s too small of a step to be recognized, that it kept falling into and then couldn’t get back out of. I ended up letting it map that room so that I could designate it as a no go zone.

I think shark needs to address this software limitation because I don’t want it going into those rooms ever, but at least I found a work around.

The next shark version has the ability to lift itself over things if it gets stuck. We’ll have to see if that includes a 2 inch step?"
1,"Great in Year 1, okay in Year 2, completely useless by Year 3","Short read: If you want to spend $300-600 on a robot vacuum that will become almost useless after 2 to 3 years then this is the product for you.

We absolutely loved this product when we got it. It worked well, connected easily, and mapped the house nicely. After about a year and a half though it had numerous problems (the robot often didn't find its way home, the battery wouldn't charge over 80%, the map of the house would wipe itself off the app periodically, and it would often need to be restarted to get it to connect to the app).

After two and a half years, it became almost completely useless. It now never finds its way back home (we just find it in the morning after it runs and put it back manually). It has no ability to connect to the app which means that it generates no visible map of the house, we can't tell it which rooms not to go into, we can't see error messages when it gets stuck, we can't instruct it to clean or dock from the app, and we have no idea where it has or hasn't cleaned when it does run because its path and duration of cleaning isn't being tracked by anything.

We also had numerous issues with the app itself not saving our information like the robot's registration, or more accurately just deleting it off the app after 6 months or so. Product support is only available over the phone so you can't just send an email or chat for a quick question, you have to wait on the phone to talk to a customer support representative overseas. For all these troubles and our useless robot, we were offered a 30% discount to purchase a brand new one from the manufacturer (which would still put the total price over what we paid for it 3 years ago).

We will absolutely never purchase this product again and don't recommend it to anyone looking for a cleaning solution that would last more than 2 years. Save yourself the time and buy a different brand."
1,Stopped working,"I bought this vacuum in July. Absolutely loved it for a couple months… now it doesn’t work. It only cleans one 6x2 rectangle randomly in the center of our living room and then docks. I have messed with all of the setting. I have messed with map, deleted the rooms, removed no-go zones. I have factory reset everything. I have cleaned it out and wiped it down. Nothing. The only way I can get it to work is by disconnecting it from WiFi AND the app and just pushing the clean button on the top, but even then it only does a slightly larger area. So disappointing especially after spending so much and loving it at first."
1,If you buy this vacuum make sure you get the amazon coverage.,"I purchased this vacuum 11/22, immediately I noticed that it would regularly get bogged down with dog fur. It would clean half of the room then stop because the fur was preventing operation. This vacuum is marketed for ""Homes with Pets"", so I had hoped for better performance in this regard. I would need to run the vacuum 2x daily in order for it to run with minimal clogging, however, there is only the option to schedule cleaning 1x daily. Over time, often running the vacuum 2x daily, it would still clog.

Because you have to manually empty the dust bin on the vacuum every time this happens there is no point in having the auto-empty feature, in the 8 months I have had it I have never had to empty the base, because it has only successfully run through an entire cycle and emptied itself a handful of times. Now on month 8, it has finally died. Despite clearing the debris from the moving parts, the vacuum refuses to work and claims it has debris preventing it from moving.

I went to contact shark and the website asks that you register your device before contacting customer support. When prompted, the website asks for the 15 digit model number. Nowhere on the vacuum is there a 15 digit model number. There is a 12 digit model numer and a 10 digit. I called the support line and received ""Thank you for calling Shark Ninja, unfortunately, we are unable to process your call at this time, goodbye."" I will attempt to contact them again and will update this review with any updates, but based off what I have found online, it sounds like shark normally only offers a 3 month warranty on their products."
1,Great upright vacuum but a horrible robot.,"UPDATE: It still sucks.

After what I paid for this thing, I am forced to use it. But the house mapping is crap and when purchasing parts from Shark, they dont tell you that if your parts come in multiple boxes through NO FAULT of your own, you STILL have to pay the shipping for each box.

Go purchase from someone else. This is INCREDIBLY disappointing.

UPDATE 11/11/2021: Save your money and get a Roomba. It doesn't follow commands to clean certain rooms. Suction has become horrible despite maintenance. This was a lot of money to spend on something that doesnt work. I am beyond frustrated.

UPDATE 9/2021: They sent me a new one after my previous complaint but no changes and now it is worse than ever. This thing doesn't update. Doesnt remember rooms. Suction has experienced a drastic decrease and I am doing EVERYTHING I'm supposed to with cleaning and mainrenance.

I am back to using my Deebot.

.................................................................
The original review:

I keep a very clean house, but I do have long thick hair and a cat. So, I've had a Deebot for years that works great. Awesome run time (>2 hrs) and the canister was always full. I decided to add a robot to my arsenal and keep the Deebot in my bedroom. I purchased this because I have a Shark upright that I love.

I made a mistake.

It allegedly makes a ""map"" of the house over multiple uses. I have found that after running this robot multiple times, it still is missing chunks of my home. The canister is barely dusty when it returns to the dock.

Plus, it never stays connected to the network. I tried to call Shark today for troubleshooting, and was first spoken to by someone who could barely understand or speak English. She tried to transfer me to someone else and ended up transferring me to ""New Orders."" When being transferred back, the system hung up. Upon calling back, it said due to extended wait times, I would receive a call back. That never happened.

I am disappointed in the performance of this machine. As well as the customer service. For the $400 I've wasted, I should have just kept using my $150 Deebot.

And that's what I intend to do."
1,Broke after one use - DO NOT BUY,"Bought the Shark robot vacuum on November 27th as part of a Black Friday sale. The vacuum was shipped quickly as we received it December 1st. I was so excited to use the vacuum. Immediately I set up the vacuum through the app and away she went. She picked our dog hair and started to map the house. I was so excited, only to be disappointed the very next day. This vacuum ran once. ONE TIME USE!!!!! December 2 the vacuum was scheduled to start it's job at 9 am. Right on time vacuum starts. Cleans for about 5 feet and then the error. Brush blocked. Turned vacuum over no blockages anywhere. Set vacuum done again and press clean button. Again vacuum moves about 5 feet and we get another error. Shut vacuum off and turn back on, same error. Call customer service. Customer service performs a video connection to determine problem with vacuum. The Customer service rep was very nice and we tried several ways to resolve the error. I showed the rep through the video that one side of the whiskers would turn easily and the other side the whisker would not turn or move at all. The customer service then tells me the housing unit needs to be replaced. Basically the whole brains of the vacuum needs to be replaces after one used. The proceeds to tell me that I need to pay $25.95 in shipping costs to receive the part, which I then have to install. I said wait a minute..... I have literally used this vacuum one time and I have to pay for the shipping of the parts to fix the vacuum and not only that I have to fix the machine myself. The rep ended up waiving the shipping costs but the part won't be here for a couple weeks and I have to perform the repairs myself. What a piece of junk!!!!!!! One use and it breaks, not worth the money. I will say the customer service rep was very nice and helpful, but really for the money I paid for this vacuum it should last more than 1 use. Very disappointed is all I can say."
1,I have now called maybe 10 times to customer service,"(Update) they say they are sending a replacement unit that I can swap out the working parts on my broken one and make a working one.. I only have 5 weeks left on my warranty now.. I really hope this actualy works. I hope they are not sending me a broken unit.

Original Message. I call and I call, they keep putting me with people that barely even know the product. Quite frankly I'm starting to think I will need a lawyer before I can get this resolved. My bot keeps forgetting the map. I make a new map, and it cant get to a single room. I call in.. they do another step, it works for one room, then back to banging its head on the wall.. I've done the updating the firmware.. they said that would fix it.. nope. Ive tried all the other ""fixes"" they have said.. nope.. its clear to me they are just trying to drag this on until the warranty has expired. no more.. I will demand a return in the morning. this has been 8 months of crap. if they dont return it.. I will be taking them to court. enough is enough. I wont continue this sort of stringing me along. it ends now,, either they give me a new one, or they talk to a judge. I'm tired of this nonsense. I suggest trying a different brand at this point.. I wanted to love this bot, I love that it can go under things, but if it never works, and the customer service just tries to kick the can till you are out of warranty, whats the point? I have 4 months till the warranty ends.. I will now demand a new robot or I will take this to the next level.. 8 months of this is enough. no more.

(Update) same as before, no resolution, they will not fix the issue, now they are saying there is no notes from the last rep that told me that if this didn't work they would do a warranty repair!? The customer service in my opinion is a scam made to make you just go away. I am sending an email compaint to the bbb, and to the Attorney Generals office for the State of Washington. maybe then I'll get this resolved."
1,Time is money; I wasted plenty of both with this.,"I bought this robot vac for my wife as a Christmas present. Then on Dec. 26th I thought I'd set it up for her. I down loaded the Shark app on my android cell phone, plugged in the base in an appropriate location and set the robot on it to charge. After a couple of hours of charging I decided it was time to connect it to my wifi. After4 attempts the app always got stuck and could not find my network. Yes, its the required old 2.4 type wifi, but multiple tries always died and failed at the same point unable to find any network. I rebooted, reloaded software and tried a dozen times. Finally I gave-in and called Shark tech support. The first tech took volumes of information but refused to help me unless I gave her the vacs serial number. THERE IS NO SERIAL NUMBER! Lots of other numbers, model, MAC address and some other sticker she didn't ever understand. Finally she put me on hold for 20 minutes and hung-up on me. I called again and after a half hour of elevator music got a different tech who was more helpful. Again I spent 15 min or so on hold. Finally she wanted to know what version of android my old phone had. I found it and told her it was Android 9. She said that's your problem. Our app only works with Android 10 or higher. Thus, I could only use the robot in manual mode. No house mapping or remote control though.
I requested a refund from Amazon and I'm returning this thing. So, if you don't have the newest and latest hardware and software for a phone you're out of luck! Don't waste your money and time like I did! Get the old Hoover out of the closet and vacuum yourself."
1,Started having issues after 6 months of daily use,I'm just listing 2 of the major issues; 1. The vacuum started stopping elsewhere (no obstruction on the floor or stucked objects or even after cleaning) on the room without completing its job. It normally docks when running out of battery but over time it started once a week until almost every day. 2. Vacuum started acting and not charging while docked unless you apply a little pressure on top of the vacuum closer to the charging terminal post. The docking station did not move and once in awhile it charges but most of the time it won't. It's acting like a loose contact.
1,It is cheaper to just hire a cleaning service. So much time wasted!!,"First, I have to say that I LOVE my Shark Rocket, so this hurts my heart to be so angry at Shark, but this vacuum has been beyond terrible.

It took forever to map our home. There isn’t an option to add a space or redo a certain part, so it probably took about 20 times for it to get it remotely accurate. Then it took weeks to get it to work. Sometimes it would wander off somewhere weird and get stuck in a restricted area, other times it just missed cleaning random areas. After a while it seemed to get better with coverage though.

There is always an error or a clog to clean up, and we don’t have any pets. We clean up everything bigger than a pea. It has no reason to get clogged so much. But the main issue I have is there is now an error that doesn’t make sense (there is debris under the non-removeable shark logo?!?). I have taken everything apart several times, the thing is as clean as when it came. I’ve picked tiny hairs from the wheels with miniature tweezers, there is literally nothing left to do. I also updated the app. Finally, admitting defeat, I call customer support, make it through their phone tree, only to be hung up on because I need to call back during business hours. At 4:00pm on a weekday. The phone line itself said they are open until 9EST. Nowhere in the app does it have anything at all about removing debris or error codes, and my model number isn’t even listed.

So, in summary, unless you want to spend at least 40 hours of your time babysitting this thing and then learn there is ZERO customer support for these things, find a better company to deal with."
1,Will not buy a Shark again,"I got this vacuum for Christmas 2022. About two weeks ago it started giving me error number six that the bumper was not moving freely. That was not the case. The bumper was fine. I took it apart. I made sure there was absolutely no debris under the wheels or in front of any of the sensors. all of the parts that are supposed to move were moving. I was still unable to get the thing going again. I even did a factory reset because I thought maybe it was some kind of computer issue. I finally called Shark and they told me it is out of warranty and that I would need to purchase a new vacuum. They did offer me a 30% discount on a new vacuum but told me that this machine is currently retailed at $600. Even the discounted price is more than what I paid for it when it went on sale before Christmas 2022 I told him, thank you but the fact that this machine died before it was even two years old, does not give me confidence in buying another shark product. I would definitely not recommend this product. I will not buy another robot from Shark. It is a shame because it was working great before the error message and then to hear that there was no fix was very disappointing."
1,Don’t Waste Your Money,"I originally bought the all white unit back in July 2024, by September 2024 the robot was already not working. I tried to troubleshoot with Shark and when that didn’t work they sent me a replacement robot as my unit is still under warranty. It’s been a few weeks running the replacement unit and it is also not operating correctly. It’s always missing sections of my home now. I have tried troubleshooting and remapping my home with no success. Neither Amazon or Shark will issue me a refund for this defective product. There is only a 30 day return window so Amazon will not honor a return even though I have had this item for less than 90 days. So I’m just stuck with a product that doesn’t work. Save your money!"
1,Not at all impressed.,"Please do not waste your money on this robot vac (RV1001AE) more not so good than good. Compared to my much older model irobot, this Shark need a lot of improvements. Even on max suction (eco, normal or max) it cannot and will not pick up nearly as much as the irobot. Performed a test of picking up black sock fuzz from carpeting, the irobot got it all in one pass, the Shark continued to fail on multiple passes. The Shark moves much slower, bangs into everything instead of slowing down and just barley touching obstacles before changing directions. It gets delayed and confused in open corners and around furniture, just moving back and forth over the same spot before finally starts moving on. For the most part, it does not follow straight lines back and forth in a large open room. It has been running for over 23 days and still has not ""mapped"" out the living, dining and kitchen room area. It does not play at all well with the Alexa app. The Shark app is lacking in functionality. When scheduling cleaning times, the vac will not run in max vacuum suction mode (even when you attempt to set it to max). It will only run on eco or normal suction mode unless you manually use the app to start the vac and set it to max mode for only that cleaning. What good is a robot vac if it wont use its full cleaning power when it automatically starts up in scheduled cleaning mode and even in max cleaning mode it can't compare to my older robot vac. Shark customer service informed me that it is set to run on normal or eco so it runs longer. Well wait a minute, it has the option to start cleaning then go to base for clean-out and quick re-charge and then restart and resume cleaning. So start on full max suction and get the job done. Not much sound volume difference between normal and max mode. Not too bad for hard surface flooring. Not good on most types of carpeting. Bought this for the shark name, automatic cleaning base and lower price. Now will just use it in the rooms with hard surface flooring and the Roomba will take care of the carpeted room. If you have any type of carpeting, find a better brand robot vac."
1,Keep your manufacturer packaging! I can't return because I recycled it.,"UPDATE: I was able to return it at UPS but had to package it myself. Whew!
ORIGINAL POST: When I first went through setup, I thought it was fine. It mapped my home. I ran it once and it was fine. I recycled the boxes. The second time, It got stuck under our bed and the battery ran low. I had a VERY difficult time getting it onto the base and charging. I finally had to put something under the front of the base for it to connect. Then it randomly ran the evacuation. Eventually the robot turned itself around and died without charging. Now it sayd error #5 drive wheel is stuck and it is no longer connected to wifi. I have tried Factory reset, but all it will do is turn in circles. Shark will not honor sending it back and I have to deal with Amazon. I will try to get help but I fear that I am out the money because I no longer have the manufacturers packaging materials. UGH! Don't Buy!"
1,Waste of time,"I was so excited to finally get one of these, but that was short lived. The app is a joke and doesn’t work well. Vaccum will not matrix clean any room on the first attempt. When I send the vacuum out it turns around quickly and goes back to the dock. On the off chance the vacuum makes it off the dock ther is a high probability it wont make it back. Unfortunately I’m out of the return period otherwise this piece of crap would be going back instead of going in the trash. $300 in the trash can."
1,Nothing but problems,"2nd update- it wont clean my living room. Even when I select the room to clean it. Truly upset I spent money on this dang thing. Update - downgrading my stars. This really can't be for a house with animals. It can't handle small pieces of food my dog drops on the floor. If the vacuum gets a piece of food then he cant empty his dustbin. I love Shark products but this is a disappointment. Oh and the brushes are gone.
I finally bought a ""better"" version than the base model I use to have and I splurged for the self empty, but I'm not happy. I have dogs and one of them has long hair, and he is a shedder, so I thought this would be a great option. It really isn't a great option though. The roller gets stuck every single day from hair! I don't think a company should claim its for pets if it cannot handle hair. Needless to say, I'm not impressed. I'm sad I spent money on something that isn't a help in keeping my house clean."
1,I hate this thing,"I bought this to replace a Roomba that lasted about 10 years. And for the first few months, I thought I made the right choice. Then about 6 months in, it started acting up. At one point, it has an entire week where it wouldn’t run for more than 3 seconds before throwing an error. The error codes in the app are vague, and when I finally could find the error it just said to call customer service. I had to spend half an hour on a video chat with them just for them to figure out they couldn’t resolve it. So I ended up taking the whole unit apart and blowing it out with an air gun. No debris came out, but I guess it was enough to clear whatever sensor was acting up.
Fast forward another 3 months and it gives the same error, and again the app was useless. I called in to their customer support again, the guy doesn’t even have to listen to me describe what’s going on before he offers me a new roller for $65?! Even if he did take the time to actually diagnose it, i still wouldn’t pay them more than twice the price I can pick them up on Amazon for! Then when I told him this was the second time I had this error, his next step was to try and upsell me on a newer model with a $25 discount “for my troubles.” I will never buy this brand’s product again just because of their customer service.
Edit: the piece of garbage has been thrown out. It’d get 2-3 minutes into a cleaning session and start throwing random error codes. Sometimes it’d say it detected a cliff in the middle of a room. Then it’d say it doesn’t detect it’s bin even though it had just came off the base. Less than 3 years, during which most of the time it was broken for one reason or another."
1,Awesome if you enjoy being frustrated,"This thing worked amazing...for the first 6 months. The hardware works good, the vacuum portion does what it was designed to do. However, the software couldn't be worse. It constantly goes to the wrong area, or does 1/4 of the room you tell it to go to, then returns to its dock. It will even give you a report of the job it did, if I tell it to do the whole house, it's own report will show one or two single file passes through half of the rooms.
And when you call tech support, they have you rotate the map 180 degrees on your phone. This get the vacuum to work decent enough for you to end your conversation with them. Then it immediately stops working again. I like every other aspect of this vacuum though, the self emptying dock and hardware are awesome. It just doesn't have any ""smart"" features that actually work."
1,after three machines none seem to work very long,Purchased this Shark machine on 3-2-2024 replaced it twice and they are trying to replace it now with a new machine on 10-30-2024. I had to agree to wait 2 weeks even though I can buy one on Amazon and have it delivered in about three days. Just lets you know what Shark thinks about the existing customer. Just get the next fool on the line and reel him or her in. It is all about the MONEY not taking care of the customer. The next shark I see will be on the end of a line in water.
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this to replace my 7 year old neato downstairs and move my old neato upstairs. I read reviews before buying this item. They seem to be positive. I have had the robot for month now and can say the review didnt lie but glossed over this products major short comings.
This product is marketed as having a map feature. I had to build my map twice. This isnt an easy task. It takes about 2 weeks of 3 cleanings a day to build a map. Once the map was built I assigned rooms to the map. This fairly clunky because rooms can only be rectangles. Other apps I have used let you just place dividers. So having best fit rectangles to the rooms in my house, I tell the IQ to clean a room on the other side of the house. It immediately starts clean around its base and slowly cleans the whole home! It did this for my first map as well. Tech support had told me to delete my map. Apparently the map doesnt do anything just let's you draw rectangles. This is my biggest beef.

Other issues I have are that it doesnt always start when I tell it. Sometimes it takes almost a minute.

When doing scheduled cleans sometimes it cleans the whole house. Sometimes it runs for 5 or 10 minutes and goes home thinking it is done.

About 1 out of 3 cleanings it will stop saying that the number is stuck and it wont even be near a wall.

Pros is the suction is good and it is quite than older robot vacuums. This is not a $500 vaccum, it is a $150 vacuum. Stay away!

UPDATE 1/14/2019: Took away one more star after spending 2 months on the phone with Shark tech support. They do not know what they are doing. They tell me that this product isnt always able to clean specific rooms. So they tried to update my robot's firmware with December's firmware. The app still shows October's firmware, but they assure me it is updated. They said that I should wait for January's firmware update and delete my map for the 5th time and try again! I do not know how they can advertise that they map out the house and can clean rooms by name when they do not support that yet!"
1,This is a terrible vacuum,"First, I'm a bad reviewer, in that I leave positive reviews for things I like, and I tend to skip reviews on purchases that are disappointing. That I'm taking the time to write this review should make an impact.

We already had a robot-vac, a Eufy, that was good. The only thing I wish it had was a mapping feature, so I could tell it to clean only one room if need be. I had hoped that the Shark name would imply great quality, let alone the MUCH higher price compared to the Eufy.

No such luck.

The fact that it has it's own dust bin is great, except that nothing is ever sucked out of it. Carpet fiber and pet hair immediately get clogged in the vacuum's dust tray, and it stops picking up anything, and, when it finally senses it is full, a trip to the dust bin to empty itself does nothing.

Second, the mapping feature is terrible. As many others report, it takes 20-30 vacuuming cycles before it completes a map of its terrain. The map is generally quite accurate. You can name the rooms on the app. Then, send the robot to clean the room you select. It cleans the room where's its base is located. Tell it to clean a different room. It cleans the room where its base is located. I.e., great that it has a map, but the map is useless.

Perhaps this vacuum would do fine in a small, two-room apartment with hard flooring. Our house is bigger, yes, and it has one room with a normal carpeting. The rest are hard-wood floors or tile (in the kitchen), with a couple area rugs that are extremely shallow, fiber wise. We also have a short-haired dog who does not noticeably shed, and a short-haired cat.

There are never clumps of pet hair anywhere, yet, the small amount that is present clogs the vac's dust tray within three minutes, as stated above. I have to empty the vac's tray at least 6 times in a 30-minute cleaning session if I want it to pick up crumbs and/or dust in the other rooms. Our Eufy, at a fraction of the price, will do a cleaning session of the same area at need to be emptied once in the middle.

My advice, do NOT buy this vacuum."
1,SHARK is NO LONGER a good product!,"RETURNED! We thought SHARK would be a quality product!

SUPPORT?! WHAT SUPPORT?!
The first shark robot vacuum we got appeared to have brain damage or a nervous breakdown. We sent it back and ordered another one. Now wasted eight hours of my time trying to set up a robot vacuum cleaner. Part of this process involved calling support. The first person said it wasn’t connect before hanging up on me. I called back to try to explain the issue to a
SECOND person who claimed that there were computer issues at the company and he could t help me. I decided to try AGAIN and now it’s running, but acting like it’s DRUNK! We have a SHARK upright vacuum, but I’m thinking after this I’ll NEVER deal with Shark again!
We’re giving it one more run. But I set a “no go” area around an antique table.
Will SHARK pay for the damage that occurred when the robot attacked the table?!!!"
1,Disappointed,"First, let me say I'm a huge Shark fan. We've had a shark vacuum for the last 15 years and have never once be dissatisfied. Unfortunately, this does not have the standards I'm used to with Shark brand. I'm disabled and am unable to use a regular vacuum any more. After seeing this advertise, I was really excited to have a good vacuum that did all the physical work so I could still keep my house clean despite my limitations. We have 2 dogs and I have long hair. So the fact this vacuum is not supposed get hair tangled was a big plus. As you can see from the picture, it did help with not tangling hair in most areas but in the center it tangles bad and I already cut my hair out of it earlier today. The picture shows how much it tangled again in just one use. The second and biggest issue I have is its ability to clean. It does not clean dog food on the floor. There was a few pieces and as soon as it picked them up it kept saying there was an obstruction that had to be manually removed. Also as you can see in the video, I have the robot vacuum set to max suction and it did little to nothing on cleaning up dirt from a flower pot I accidentally knocked over. I had to use the regular vacuum and you can immediately see the difference. If I'm going to rely on a vacuum, I need to make sure it does a good job and this showed me how little it actually did. I'm extremely disappointed. Especially for the price, I expected a decent vacuum. No, I didn't expect it to be perfect but I did expect it to be pretty decent, epecially being the Shark brand. I did not expect it to be next to useless. I do not recommend this vacuum."
1,IShark robot,"If you have dogs don't buy it. I have used roomba exclusively. I have a Shark Rotator Professional vacuum and I just love it. I thought I would try the Shark iRobot but I hate it. The unit sucks. I have two dogs, a Boxer mix & a Doberman Lab mix. The machine can't handle the hair and I run it daily. It only has one roller and a brush in back of the roller which causes the hair to pile up on it. I had to go back to roomba."
1,Died 1 week shy of 3 months,"Had this unit for almost 3 months, but it suddenly came up with a side brush error (error #2, specifically), and no matter what we tried, we couldn't get it to work again. So after talking to Shark, they offered to send a replacement out. I'm just surprised it failed already. When I took the side brushes off, they commented on how clean it looked, and were surprised it failed already. So I guess I got a defective unit?

It did have issues within the first month though. It would run and randomly stop without cleaning the whole area, and head back to the dock. After troubleshooting a little bit, we got it to work again.

It is really quiet (was..) during the cleaning cycles. A lot more quiet than our last two. But the suction wasn't very good. We have bare floors and it struggled to pick up the cat litter on the floor that had been tracked out of the litter boxes. It was pretty good with fur and hair. And just dust in general. But anything that had weight to it, it wouldn't really pick up. But here I am with a dead one, waiting on them to send out another one, so we'll see how that goes..."
1,Would buy a Roomba instead,"I bought this because I read a couple of reviews comparing this one to a Roomba so I thought that it would be fair to try it out. It absolutely does not compare to a Roomba. I had a Roomba i1 and it can run circles around this thing. It is quieter and the emptying bin is quieter but I think that just means that the suction is 10 times less than the Roomba. I would absolutely not buy this again. It leaves trails of dirt from underneath the brush area. It doesn’t even get to the emptying bin. It gets stuck so easy and small areas, and on things where the Roomba can untangle itself and usually manages to get itself out this one fails miserably. It hardly ever cleans the entire house without getting stuck, or failing to make it back to the bin to recharge itself. Buy a Roomba. It seems like any Roomba would be better than the shark. Not to mention the app absolutely sucks. Hate hate hate it. Roomba app is so much easier to use. So many more options. The only option in the shark app is to start it.. the Roomba app can schedule when to start it. You can set it to follow your location so that it comes on when you leave the house you can attach it to Alexa so you can tell Alexa to start and stop it and send it home. This one cannot do anything."
1,Don't waste your time with this one...you will be sorely dissapointed,"I have quite a bit of experience with robot vacuums....I love the things! This one I had high hopes for but they were quickly dashed. I was hoping this would be a more affordable option than going with the Roomba I7 but it is just awful. After one run of my house, I knew this was not the vacuum for me. The reviews that say it sounds like a helicopter are not wrong! This thing is loud and it sounds like there is something stuck in the brush always with the constant clicking sounds. I have all hardwood floors in my entire main floor and all other robot vacuums I have had have no problem picking up all the dust and hair and crumbs left from my pets and children. But this one, after the first cleaning cycle, you couldn't even tell it had vacuumed and I had it on the highest suction power. The rotating arm design with only one arm instead of a three pronged arm is not a good design. They kept flipping stuff completely out of the path of the vacuum into places it had already been so then it never got picked up. I watched it go over some cat litter and it maybe picked up 30% of what was there where my other vacuum gets it all no problem. Also, the reviews about the mapping are also 100% correct. The map is crap. There are just no other ways to say it. Its crap. If I were you, I would save yourself the hassle of buying and returning this piece of junk and go for the 360 robot vacuum. Of all the robots I've tried, it takes the cake for the best one! It cleans efficiently, maps my house, does everything the most expensive roombas do, minus the whole sucking out the dust bin thing. But seriously....how hard is it to empty a dust bin people? That is a first world problem if I ever heard of one! I will happily keep emptying my bin on my 360 vacuum every day hands down over wasting my money on this piece of junk!"
1,"I hate this vacuum, constantly breaks","I absolutely hate this vacuum and it was a complete waste of $250. Less than a year into owning it stopped running the blueprint of our house and would only go to ""living room"". 5 feet from anything in any direction. After working with Shark on repeatedly phone calls to reset the firmware it worked again for about a month. Then it went completely dead all together unable to detect that it was on the charger and unable to charge at all. One day this week it sparatically turned on again and charged. Once again it only detects ""living room"" and not the other 3 rooms. This thing is a complete piece of garbage."
1,Totally useless,"we bought the Shark mainly for its mapping feature: this totally fails and robot goes into the no go zone each time.
Every time it runs one of the brushes falls off, mainly when it goes from a rug to tile .
The run time is @30 minutes.Ridiculous.
The FAQ and trouble shooting is totally not helpful.Would like to return and get a refund but Amazon direect me to Shark and vice versa.
Do not buy a Sharkproduct is the short advice."
1,I’m a fool,"Let me start by saying it takes a LOT for me to leave a review, good or bad. In this case I wish I would’ve trusted the bad reviews that came before me. This shark was the BOMB for three whole months. I woke up in the mornings excited to go downstairs and see the perfect beautiful lines the shark left for me every night at 0100. For those first three months I thought to myself, “See?! I knew this vacuum would be awesome! Those people on Amazon were crazy!” Yeah well that was before the red light of death. I YouTubed everything under the sun because I’m a pretty mechanically inclined person, but it doesn’t matter in this case because there’s literally no fix. I finally throw in the towel and contact the support line where they made me do a video chat with them to verify the vacuum was actually broken. They verified. They told me they could send me PARTS from another refurbished vacuum and it would be up to me to cannibalize the old one and piece it all together. Oh and on top of that they couldn’t guarantee all the colors would be the same since they have three different color sharks. Then they made me pay $25 in shipping. I got an email in mid April saying the shipping label had been created. Here we are 15 May and the shipping label has still been created….an absolute piece of crap… CRAP. Trust me, DO NOT BUY. This thing will tease your heart for three months and then absolutely crush your soul!"
1,"Worst robotic vacuum EVER, and even worse support","I typically do not write reviews but I feel I have to on this product. I’ve owned several different brands and types of robotic vacuums and I purchased this one because this was one of the only ones out that had self empty base station. I feel like this vacuum has had more problems than anything it always gets hung up on things, it doesn’t have that much suction to really suck up things, the brushes don’t do a very good job at sweeping things too it’s roller, its path is basically straight lines and often curves and misses pretty large areas. I’ve been having a continual problem with one of the brushes moving either very slow or not at all then coming up with an error where the robotic vacuum stops and its tracks and it flashes a red light. Upon my search on the Internet I found multiple videos of other people having this exact problem. It seems like it is a manufacturing defect because there is no hair or anything wrapped on any inner parts or even around the brush. The only fix is to manually move the brush while it is in motion to “kickstart it”… it will then work for a little while but then come up with the same error. This is obviously a major issue for a robotic vacuum because most people would like to schedule it when you’re not around etc. After contacting support they wanted to offer me 10% off a brand new unit. I feel that is absolutely absurd knowing that this product has not worked very well from the beginning and paid $340 for it at the time and they will not even offer a “fix” for it as they do not work on vacuums. They only sell them. I’m DONE with the brand SHARK and any of its products or subsidiary companies."
1,What good is it if it never works,"I normally do not write reviews on products but this thing has been an actual pain. We have had it for less than a year and it has worked maybe 8 times successfully. For starters, it does not properly map. We have a fairly small house and very little furniture and it only gets some of the rooms. The house is all hardwood so it doesn't have much terrain to roll over. I rerun the map to help fix its other issues and have to do it 5 times before it works, and even then it is not even close because it doesn't get close to the house's layout. Another thing is it constantly is coming off the dock and then going right back on. I have called customer service about this issue and they apparently updated it so this problem would be fixed. We were supposed to receive an email when it was done updating but it never was received so no the issue was not fixed. The last issue is that when it does work it will only do so much. What I mean by that is that it does not even get in the middle of a room. There is always dust left on the floor and pet hair everywhere. I wish we would have bought a product that actually worked but we did not and now we are left sweeping the house ourselves because we cannot run the product we paid for without watching it struggle around the house. Do not get it. I am serious. It was a waste of time and money."
1,Worst robot vacuum I've ever owned,"This had great reviews and I caught it on sale, but very quickly it became apparent the vacuum was vastly inferior to other models I've used. In a year it's been inert a majority of the time, because when it runs it's bad at vacuuming, it gets stuck on the tiniest rug edge, can't come close to a bathroom rug without eating it and dying, and gives constant errors. Now with the latest app update it's completely inoperable. Based on cost and usage I probably paid about $5 per hour of operation for this utterly worthless product. Hard do not recommend."
1,It’s not going to give out while under warranty,"It works good enough if you’re aren’t perfectionistic. But I neglected to charge it after a few months in the winter because I mostly used it in the sunroom, which we don’t use in the winter. I did replace brushes, the beater bar, filters, anything that came in the kit I bought. Well, it stopped charging altogether. I have yet to try a new battery but sheeze! For the dough we plunked down, you would think a little break wouldn’t kill the dang thing! I say look elsewhere. I can’t justify NOT getting my money’s worth for quite a while. A dud for sure."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!! PIECE OF JUNK!,"If I could give this product a complete zero , I would. I will never purchase another Shark brand item again. I purchased this item during the 2020 Black Friday event, I was super excited to get them item as I have a long haired dog who sheds like crazy! The item came super quick and was well packaged and included all the correct parts, etc. During the initial set up I could not get the item to connect to my Wi-Fi, I called shark who told me it was because I have AT&T internet. In order to resolve this, Shark recommended that I create a guest Wi-Fi network to connect their vacuum to and that it should stay connected to the guest network. I created the guest network and connected the vacuum, hoping this would resolve my issue. It temporarily resolved my issue and worked for 1-2 cycles of cleaning. Then after 2-3 days I would come home from work and the vacuum would be in the middle of the floor, dead, because it started to clean on automatic schedule and it couldn't find the way back to the home base. I had several issues like this and each time I called shark customer service to get assistance and was told its because I have AT&T Wi-Fi and they are working to resolve the issue. However, the customer service reps at Shark were very rude, would not send a replacement model. I told the representative that I'm not obligated to keep their vacuum that doesn't work, I could return it to Amazon and get a full refund and go purchase a Roomba. The representative said , and I quote "" Well, call me back and let me know how that goes for you"". At that point, I was so frustrated and upset about something not working properly that I spent so much money on that, that's exactly what I did. I returned that piece of junk to amazon, got a full refund. Then went and purchased the Roomba, and I must say, it has been a night and day difference. I LOVE LOVE LOVE my roomba with self emptying base, its truly like having a extra set of hands around the house to keep floors tidy while I focus on cleaning other things."
1,Great WHILE it lasted.,"I was really happy with this fancy robot vacuum until I came home one day to find that it had become disconnected from our WiFi. I attempted to reconnect it multiple times and multiple ways; however, I could never get it to go into ""pairing"" mode. Everything via the app seemed to be ok. It was charging, it would power on and off, and I went through all the ""reset"" steps before calling the company. I was told the internal computer must have suffered a surge and quit working properly. 🙄 It was past the 1 year warranty, so there was nothing they could do except offer me $30 off a new one. 😒 My reply was, ""All you can do is offer $30 off a $500 vacuum that has only been used a little over a year? No, thanks! I'll purchase another brand!""

I purchased a very similar Eufy, for half the price of a Shark, and so far, so good!! 🤗"
1,Don't buy used from Amazon services llc.,"Bought this used. It appeared to be sold by Amazon and shipped by Amazon. Apparently Amazon.com Services, Inc was the seller. It looked like it was sold by Amazon Resale renamed from Amazon Warehouse.
I recieved a robot that worked for less than one foot and could not go on. Why sell an obviously untested broken unit? It was packaged nicely and the collection bin looked good. The vacuum did not function. I was replacing a Shark Robot that I liked very much until it quit. Don't make my mistake and by used from Amazon. Amazon has changed for the worst. The refund system is slow and misleading. I am still waiting for them to refund my money to my account."
1,Best for Surgically Sterile homes,"I picked this up before Christmas as a cost effective alternative to the “name” brand robot vacuum.
I wanted to love, he’ll even like this bot, but sadly I don’t and cannot recommend.
It may be great for some people, but … NOT for pet owners, not for carpets thicker than 1/4 inch.
I literally have to take it apart and clean the rollers, wheels and beater assembly every other vacuum if not every vacuum.
I have it set to run M,W,F,Sun.
It allegedly has a large capacity and “bin” but it does not.
Caveat, I have 2 dogs that are mostly inside but do shed. I run my upright Shark vacuum 2X a week and this still clogs.
another thing I noticed is that the “home base” storage bin opens VERY easily when removing to empty it and then all the junk spills on your floor.
So, buy maybe if you don’t have pets, or if you do it is a hairless pet, and no carpets to speak of and probably a smaller home/apartment that is mostly a surgically sterile environment so the bot won’t be taxed to do some work."
1,Don’t bother,"This is the worst machine that was ever built. Its app is completely unstable, and as soon as you get it, set up and behaving as you’d like, it no longer remembers you and you have to set it up all over again. Dysfunctionality is fine, if it actually effing worked on a regular basis. But because of its inability to continue after initialp set up makes this a colossal waste of money"
1,Lacking in all aspects.,"We've had this thing for about 8 months now and it's all around disappointing. It does vacuum our floors just fine. We have 2 dogs and this is great at sucking up their fur. But the vacuum constantly gets ""stuck"" right in the middle of the floor or has trouble finding the dock. It also constantly forces itself up the angled legs on a coffee table and then gets stuck.

The lack of sensors to detect stairs is also annoying. Instead, you need to put down this strip of rubber to block places you don't want the vac to go. It's an eye sore and if you have wood/tile floors, then you'll need to find a way to adhere it to the floor so that it doesn't move from foot traffic.

The erratic behavior of this app isn't even the most annoying thing about it. The app is TERRIBLE.

It is incredibly slow to load and communication with the vac is even slower. Using the app to pause cleaning generally takes 3-5 minutes before the vac actually stops. Trying to resume takes just as long.

The app also claims to allow users to create ""no-go zones"" to limit your vacuum's travels. Only problem is that there's no actual way to create them.

You can create a map of your home within the app, but this seems to only be necessary if you want to use your home assistant (Alexa, Google, etc) to tell it to clean a particular room. You can set a schedule to clean within the app, but only the entire Floorplan. No ability to schedule it to clean a specific room or space, which seems like lazy app development.

Overall, this thing is just frustrating and annoying. We recently purchased a Roomba for our 2nd floor and it is a better vac by every possible metric and we will be replacing the Shark in the near future. Yes, they cost a little more, but it's more than obvious why."
1,"Hardware is solid, software is absolute garbage. For this kind of money buy something else.","This thing has good suction, and the parts hold up really well. Physically speaking this is a good product, but this thing is horrible because of shotty software design. Shark must have been totally out of their element managing computer programmers. I have had this product since november of 2020, and I am still trying to get this stupid thing to map my house and complete a clean without me babysitting it. I bought this model so I could hit a button on my phone from my office and have the house cleaned without any effort from me. Why else would you buy the model with the big dust bin. The app is garbage, it never connects to the vacuum unless the vacuum is already running, so enjoy running to where you have this plugged in every time you want to use it. The map never gets fully completed, even if you go in and add rooms the thing still cant understand whats going on. Even in the areas of my house it learned well, it still will randomly turn around and go back to the dock thinking its done prematurely. It also is perhaps the worst roomba i've ever seen when it comes to cleaning the edges of your walls. It doesn't clean a darn thing if its within a centimeter of a wall, and don't even get me started on how awful it is in corners. I am really upset with this product, it was marketed last year as a top of the line, do it all roomba like product. The cheap crappy chinese one my roommate bought works better than this and cost half the price. Stay away from Shark products when it comes to autonomous robots, they might have known how to get you cheap handvacs for the last 20 years, but they are so far out of their element. I don't believe a single reviewer that's given more than 3 stars has ever seen what one of these is supposed to function like."
1,Junk!!!,"After numerous scans of the dinning room and rearranging all my furniture, this vacuum failed to capture an accurate plan. The performance fails when cleaning. It mentions that it will take about 40 minutes to clean the house and instead hovers in the same section for 10 minutes and struggles to dock. I’ve moved the base to different areas and nonetheless I can’t get this things to sweep in a different direction. It’s the worst vacuum I’ve ever had. It’s super loud and I can’t vacuum at night when I get home from work. I prefer the IRobot 100 times over this Shark Ninja. I was really excited that it could vacuum carpets but that’s not true. It got a piece of my curtain and practically took down the whole rod! For the size and value for the money I’d prefer something smaller, not so loud, and way cheaper. The AI feature is a joke"
1,Junk vacuum. Doesn’t deserve even one star.,This is the second remote vacuum we’ve owned and it is the worst. It does not pick up dirt very well. It misses spots. It gets stuck on the wooden vents and edges of thicker area rugs. Wish we had bought the IRobot again. No wonder this one was on sale. Just missed the 30 day return window. We do not recommend this vacuum.
1,Would have been easier to just vacuum myself **UPDATED**,"I set this up last night, let it charge overnight, and then ran it for the first time today. I have already spent more time fixing ""Error number 2"" than it would have taken me to vacuum my entire house 3 times. Error number 2 basically means that it's clogged and the brush can't spin freely. Every time I fix it, it will stay fixed for about 2-3 minutes on average, and then it just errors again. It doesn't seem any more intelligent than the ""stupid"" ones that just pick a random direction and go...in fact it has unseated it's own dock 4 times already, although that doesn't matter because it's never once tried to return to the dock. So far the only feature I like is that the app lets me hit a button and the vacuum will play a tune so I can locate where it's stuck at this time. I would not recommend this item.

**UPDATE**
I've had this for about 2 weeks now, and I have entered into an uneasy truce with the machine. I start it manually, and then an hour later go find wherever it quit, fix whatever was wrong with it, and put it back on the charger. Once the charge hits 100%, I run it again. So I've been running it about 5-6 times per day. It's still not great, but on the other hand, it's not that inconvenient to reset it once every hour, and it IS working; I can tell that the carpet has been vacuumed. So it doesn't really work as advertised, but it IS a functional vacuum and will eventually have saved me some time.

**UPDATE**
I've had this for a year and a half now. Less than 30% of the time it would run through a complete cycle and return to base. The rest of the time it would throw an error 2. Now it's at the point where it throws an error 2 as soon as it leaves the charging base. I've purchased a competitor's product, because this thing is expensive garbage."
1,"It works, but does it?","All the points for this vacuum go to suction, which is something I love about Shark. I picked this because my larger Shark vacuum is a powerhouse and thought I could expect the same from their robot version. Wrong! When it is working, it cleans well (edges are hit and miss). Problem is, it rarely works. After two months of use, only rarely can it find it's way back to the base to empty or charge. More frequently it drives aimlessly until the battery goes dead. It throws error messages of all sorts (bumper jammed, dust cup missing, everything is random and never true) and stops cleaning, when really it just needs a filter shake off but won't tell you that. Sometimes it tries to dock but seems to not be able to locate the dock so it just gives up and goes to sleep in the middle of a room and I have to hunt it down. I got the strips to keep it out of certain areas (cords), but it runs them over and then gets stuck and won't finish cleaning because somehow it detects them after the fact. In two months of cleaning, only twice has it successfully cleaned my entire 960 sq ft area and returned to charge without my help. It has to charge twice during each cleaning, so battery is unimpressive. Changing the filters and maintaining the base are easy, points for that. It did successfully map my house, but then it repeatedly deleted the map and restarted mapping it, also deleting my schedule and all cleaning history. Over and over and over. The app needs a lot of work. My advice, spend the extra money and buy something that will do what it claims to do."
1,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I have to say, I have had this vacuum for 5 months and it does an ok job vacuuming the floors but to this day still does not have a map of the house, one of the main requirements I had in buying it. I have given it time like support posts but it's not developing and I have given up trying to get it fixed. I will gift this to someone as a first robo vac this December as I will be replacing it with another Roomba"
1,Do not buy a Shark Vacuum,"I've been using my Shark vacuum for about a month, and now it's giving me an error code related to the front bumper. The machine isn't working at all. I live in a small house with laminate flooring—no carpet and no animals. I've followed all the recommendations I found on YouTube for clearing the front bumper, but nothing seems to work. This is my third Shark vacuum, and honestly, they don't seem to last very long. I'm getting pretty frustrated! Any help would be appreciated -"

We love this vacuum. We have one upstairs and downstairs in our home for our floors. I love that. Ours is a 60 day capacity so we do not have to worry about cleaning out the dust canister every single day. And so conveniently sucks all of the delivery into a canister when it is done which easily removed and dump into trashcan. It has a coordinating app where you can schedule Times where it’s a clean as well as no go areas or if you want it to be clean just ones specific room, etc..","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

When I bought this, I was actually going to send it back at first because I was thinking it wasn’t working well.

In both houses we had a den with a step down; All you have to do to vacuum that room is removed it from the dock place it in the room and press clean. The only thing that I'd say is ""rudimentary"" is the scheduling; you can only schedule the whole house, not any particular room. However, you can directly command via the app. to clean a room or a select group of rooms. This is ok for me considering the price is relatively affordable.","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2024"

I’ve read all the reviews and need to say I’ve had zero issues with this vac. It mapped my house perfectly in one run. I was even able to customize the map and block off the stairs since I have a bi level home and was afraid it would fall down the stairs. This little bot does an amazing job!! It goes back to the dock when it’s full and empties out and goes right back to the spot it left off at and continues cleaning. I have to mention I have all hardwood floors and no pets (yet) so it may be a little different for others. I also have small rugs all around my home and in my bathrooms and I’ve had no issues with it getting stuck or trapped on them. The battery doesn’t die like some have complained about but again I’ve also only had it for about a month so I can’t speak too much on that.

Pros: Set up was very easy and not time consuming. The home mapping is amazingly accurate, plus you can label the rooms and set boundaries. It alerts you if stuck or any obstacles are in it's way. Plus, my favorite function is you can set a schedule for when to run!

Cons: Can be noisy when it's emptying itself, but overall pretty quiet when running.","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024"

5,I'm pretty happy with the performance in the first few weeks.,"I haven't had this very long but I bought it to replace an iRobot S9 Plus that I bought and returned because it would not manage my tile carpets. This little shark can get over anything. It avoids obstacles, and has not had any trouble except for one small light clothing item that got sucked into the wheel and brush. The vacuum signaled me on my phone that I was having a problem, beeped to tell me where it was, and after I removed the clothing item, it knew where it was and was able to return to the base for a charge, then continue vacuuming. The base is bagless so it's easy to grab it, walk over to the garbage, and tip the dust out. I'm using a program to have it start a couple mornings a week, and another couple of programs to start in the day and evening when we are typically not in the house. It handles leaving chairs and other obstacles around fine, knowing that it's not going to vacuum under a spot if we have a big box or something like that. We happen to be vacuuming four times a week. That's adequate. Maybe we could get by with less, but since we don't have to think about it, we just let it do its thing. I realize we're still fairly new owners of the shark, but so far I'm pretty happy. The app seems to work well. The robot made a good map of the house on the first try. Setting up zones and rooms was pretty straightforward. If you have really odd shaped areas, you can make them by creating multiple rectangles, including some at angles if needed, and merging them. We haven't created any no-go zones, but that seems to be a pretty straightforward process also. If we don't want it to go into a space, we just don't select that space when we create the job.","Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2024"

Happily enough they sit in the couch and just watch. The only real noise it makes is when returning to the dock to empty. I only have to dust mop along and behind the furniture. It does a great job transitioning between the hardwood floor and area rugs. It goes everywhere it can reach.

It’s very easy to use once you have it set up and it maps out your house. It sees itself, which is the coolest thing. If I were to say one negative about it is when it does empty itself out it does smell of dust in the air for about 15 seconds or so. It doesn’t smell good and I don’t like it but oh my God it’s my new issue compared to what it does for me my life. Once again it’s a game changer of quality it does not mop, which is what I thought it did first, but now I’m kind of glad that it doesn’t because I have found throughout the years that if you get a machine that does more than one thing that complicates things and they’re more app to break one thing cleans the floors and it does very well I hope it lasts forever !","Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2024"

5,Best robot vaccuum yet!,I love my Shark robot vaccuum!!! Saves me so much time! We have a German shepherd and a husky and there's always dog hair on the floor. I run this everyday to keep the floors clean and only pull out the real vaccuum (also a shark and also love it) maybe once a week now just to get the stuff if hard to reach places. I can run this and then immediately mop that's how good it works. Love the self emptying feature. Although that part is pretty loud. Otherwise pretty quiet (compared to a previous Roomba and off brand I had before) . Mapping worked great first time!

5,Absolutely amazing; I haven't manually vaccumed in weeks and my house is very clean,"Play Video
This thing far exceeded my expectations. We have a dog and that means hair everywhere. I programmed this thing to automatically vacuum every day and it does a great job. It's not very loud and does an amazing job. We had 3 dogs for a week and it even kept up with that. Of course, if you leave socks and bras on the floor it will suck them up and get stuck but you shouldn't do that anyway (I'm talking to you, honey!). It navigates around chairs, goes under the bed, etc. Of course it can't get into the very corner of a room but it gets very close.

The only bad thing is that it can only map out a single floor. My house is one level with a sunken great room; to get it to clean other floors you just carry it to there and press the clean button. Not terrible, but it seems like an obvious feature that is missing. You also can't program it to clean more than once a day. Still, have I mentioned that my house is ALWAYS CLEAN? It's awesome--like having a maid but you only have to pay once. I rarely recommend products to friends, this one is an exception.","Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024"

The app leaves alot to be desired and the small changes they could do really wouldn't be that bad. If you have a long haired cat, the 60 day dirt holder and robots dirt holder arnt gonna last. I empty its dirt holder out once a week because the base just can't suck the hair out but I think for most people this robot will be great. The first few weeks can be rough learning what it will and won'teat. That you left on the floor, what it will get stuck on and ect.","Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2024"

4,Good for its price,"Works great, but two complaints. I’ve had this cool robot for 3 months, and it’s great at keeping open spaces clean. However, it doesn’t get the dirt right up against the walls and furniture. Before I let it clean, I have to use a broom to get the stuff at least an inch from the walls. Another thing is that it can’t comprehend any type of plastic. You know those little plastic T- shaped things that come on products to keep the tag in place? If it picks up one of those, the vacuum gets clogged and it just stops being able to function. Also does the same with any small pieces of plastic. If these things bother you, consider finding a more expensive robot.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

4,Works great for auto vac,"Works better than expected! Honestly. I have 6 dogs and 4 cats. I need the floor clean d of hair daily, sometimes twice a day. This unit works great as expected. The cons are that you have to clean the floor first LOL. Picking up obviously larger stuff than the vac can eat. Like sticks, plastic ties, whole pieces of dry dog food, that sort of thing, & of course the dog beds and blankets. A quick sweep into the dust pan does most. 2nd not so great thing is it can leave wads of dog hair and dirt. I dunno if it doesn’t realize it needs dumping or it doesn’t “swallow” the stuff past the brushes, but I spend time almost every run cleaning brushes cause it’s stuck w/hair &/or sweeping up the wads leftover. I’m assuming that’s all vacs, not just this one. Like I said, 6 dogs LOL. Other than that, it really helps me keep the gloors decent. I’m disabled and sweeping the house myself isn’t an option. So overall I find the Shark vac extremely helpful & I really like the large tank so I don’t have to dump it daily. Easy to use. Fairly sturdy tho it did argue with a table leg & lost. Now one side is taped on. Battery life good, as advertised .","Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2024"

4,Strong,"Love this product for simple everyday cleaning. The schedule cleaning and mapping are great features. You can block certain rooms that you don’t want to clean. The machine is pretty strong where it will climb over the legs of a desk or push some things around. Wish this one would connect to our Alexa, but not a dealbreaker because we can use the shark app. The self cleaning is great. Noticed that the canister will pop out slightly when full which is a nice visual sign for us to empty. If you have dogs that shed a lot, the canister normally fills up in about three weeks. When the Robot empties into the canister, it is kind of loud. It sounds like when an airplane takes off. Another good feature is that there are “do not disturb” times you can set. If you have a bigger house and the battery dies, it will go back to the station to charge, then start vacuuming again. The “do not disturb” option helps with this so that it doesn’t go off at 2 AM to finish your house. I Enjoy this purchase!","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2024"
4,Overall great,"We’ve had a few brands of these now and let me just say the mapping on this is great compared to others we’ve tried and the app works well compared to other smart apps we’ve used. While it still runs into things here and there it seems more minimal than other brands and versions. I absolutely love that I rarely have to empty this, we are a BUSY family in just under a1,000 sq ft home and although we do keep it tidy we use every space in our home so functionality is a MUST. By the time I get done with the evening rush of homework, dinner, dishes etc. I rarely have energy left to vacuum.

As a busy family I would buy again purely for the convenience!","Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2024"

4,"Great robot, but app disconnects once in a while","I live with three cats, and I have back pain that limits my movements, so this robot is perfect for me: I mapped the house and there's an area called ""cats"" where their bathrooms are. Every time a cat leaves one of the bathrooms, I scoop and tell the app to clean the cats area. It works phenomenally in that sense. It catches the litter and the hair it finds around. Once in a while I also use it in other areas and works well both in carpet and wood floors. I am happy with the product, in general.

The problem it has is the app. It is experimental, I guess, and has a lot of problems. One of them is that every time I go to the section ""rooms"" to select only my cat area, for some reason it changes to ""hallway."" Every single time. So I have to wait, it changes it, I change it back, and then I can hit ""matrix clean."" (Matrix clean is excellent for the cat area, it doesn't miss a single litter piece). If I am in a hurry, sometimes I have hit ""clean"" and I see it going to the hallway. This is a bit annoying. Also, in the ""rooms"" section, the first thing that appears is a map where you could click the area(s) to be cleaned, but it doesn't work in my app. I have to click a button so it shows it to me in the form of a list - only then can I select rooms.

Yesterday it completely disconnected from my robot. I had to configure it again. Today it disconnected from the account. I had to look for the password and log in again. And now, I went to the app to tell the robot to clean, and the app says ""disconnected."" I am not sure what it means. I hit ""clean"" on the robot itself, and now it is cleaning my whole apartment. The cat area is not well cleaned because I can't ""matrix clean"" it.

So I am kind of frustrated right now. The robot is perfect, the app is a piece of garbage.

Even with the volume at 100% in the app you still can't hear it unless you are standing right next to it. That means when it gets stuck somewhere it ends up being a room-by-room search looking under beds, etc. to rescue it. Previous versions of the Shark robot vacuums did not have this issue. When I use the app to have the robot play a location sound you could hear it and at least head in the right direction.","Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2024"
4,Good Vacuum,"I’m glad I got this on sale for half price because I like it but I wouldn’t have been happy paying full price for it. I’ve been using it for a couple of months and I can say that I like the relative low noise (all of these vacuums are loud but this one is tolerable), am a huge fan of the debris auto unload feature, and am happy overall with the general cleaning ability of this vacuum. It seems to do very well with daily sweeping of pet floof but if I wait more than 2 days to run it, the vacuum is less efficient. I recommend daily or every other day use for best results. Edge cleaning is non-existent, but I resolved that by taking a broom and whisking edge debris to the center of the room and the vacuum would grab it from there. The vacuum is a really nice supplement to having to physically vacuum my home, and because I have pets and I appreciate having it. I don’t have any thick carpets and my home is vinyl and tile flooring. This vacuum has done very well with low throw rugs and under beds. It also does NOT bang itself against items or walls and if you’ve have a Roomba, you know what I’m talking about. Ha ha! Love the app and I use it most of the time to remotely initiate cleaning but it’s nice to be able to walk by the vacuum and push the “clean” button, too.

4,Struggles with thick dog hair,"I love the robot vacuum. I like that I can schedule it to run, and I don’t have to think about it. I haven’t had it get caught on any cords or wires. The first time the spinner brush got dog hair in it, it took me a few days to figure out the colored ends come off too and hair will get stuck in there. I also have long hair so that can get tangled.

My complaint is that it gets clogged easily. I have a Labrador so lots of course dog hair. The dog hair will collect and clog at the entrance to the bin on the vacuum (the space between the roller brush and where the dirt is stored while the vacuum runs). It will get so compacted in there that it can’t empty into the trash bin. That does get annoying.

Another issue I have is it seems to lose suction when it transitions from hard wood to the area rug, especially on the corners of the rug. I always seem to find wads of dog hair near the corners of the rugs. So I end up doing a spot clean around the corners after it does a vacuum of the room.

Overall, I really like it. I like that I can control it from my phone, and it always seems to be quicker than the predicted time on the app, which is a good thing. I would buy it again but not sure I would get it if I had more than one hairy dog.","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024"

4,OK so far,"I have been tempted to buy a robot vacuum for several years and finally pulled the trigger.

The Good
- Easy set-up. App is intuitive.
- Easy to empty the robot and stand vacuum compartments.
- We primarily have hardwood floors. Floors receive traffic from a couple pets and kids. The areas of the floors the robot can access appear to receive a better cleaning then being swept by hand.
- Robot does a decent job navigating and doesn't appear to be missing any large areas.
- Robot cleans under beds and couches, areas that are difficult to sweep manually.

The Bad
- There's a chair the robot get stuck under. The chair legs are just wide enough for the robot to squeeze through but sometimes the robot can't find it's way out. Maybe just need to block these chair legs before activating in the future.
- The robot vacuum compartment has already been clogged. However, areas underneath the beds were very dirty. With some more regular cleaning in these areas I'm hoping clogging ceases to be an issue.
- When sending the robot to a couple bedrooms it tries to take a weird path instead of heading down the hallway. Eventually, the vacuum finds its way, but the vacuum doesn't seem to be using the house map appropriately.

Overall, I'm satisfied and think this vacuum might save me a couple hours of sweeping every week. There's still some manual sweeping and vacuuming for the baseboards, floor seams, and other areas the vacuum can't access but that's to be expected. If the robot lasts at least a couple years I will have gotten my money's worth.","Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2024"

We sort of learned each other over a few weeks and I LOVED how the house looked. If there was a problem we figured it out and cleaned her when needed. But then came the day when she started out and then stopped after 2 or 3 feet, whining about her side brush being stuck. We have taken it off, cleaned it and just done everything we can think of but she still claims it is stuck. My house looks terrible and I feel that is no behavior for such an expensive item to indulge in! I found one video that advised ""tweaking"" the side brush, but that didn't work.

4,New to Robot Vacuums,"Since I can't leave a 4.5 out of 5 stars, I'll go ahead and just round down and here is why:

Let me first preface this by saying I had a huge bias against purchasing a robot vacuum. I honestly thought they were useless, unable to adequately clean the house, and would be built to be more of a remote control car than an actual cleaning device.

Well....Prime Day comes along, and this bad boy is on sale, and I figured I'd take a shot at it. I have a husky, and I spend most of my evenings sweeping the floor - CONSTANTLY. It would get so bad, especially during the summers where I'd just be exhausted from work, gym, and dinner that I would avoid sweeping until the next day or the day after. I eventually transitioned to using my vacuum, which helped a little, but I found myself going through the process of still sweeping, then vacuuming to pick up any missed particles of hair, fuzz, or dust.

So...I bought this guy, and omg it's been a godsend. I run this bad boy every three days, and my house is noticeably cleaner and smells better. I can literally relax and play with my dog while the robot is cruising around the house picking up everything!. I was impressed by the amount it picked up. As a result of the frequency, I find less and less hair/dirt/fuzz on the floor. Don't get me wrong, I still use my broom and hand held vacuum, but that's usually on the weekends when I do a much deeper clean of the home. However, it takes less time because there is so much less mess on the floor. I still speculate that the robot isn't 100%, but I guess neither am I. HAHAHA

Pros:
- Cleans my 900 sqft home in about 40 minutes. Able to pick up dust, fur, dirt, and crumbs from the floor with no issues. (haven't tried larger objects)
- The wheels are like hidden monster truck wheels and are independent of each other so that it can traverse over carpet and other slightly elevated areas.
- The app allows a full map of your house, as well as creating or sectioning off your home so that the if you want to vacuum specific areas (in my case the kitchen and game room where my husky usually sleeps or hangs out) it will clean the area and be done.
- The speed settings are pretty nifty too, and can be adjusted to get a much thorough cleaning.

Cons:
- This could be my fear, but due to the warning about liquids on the floor, I have to do a preclean to make sure there isn't spots of drool from my dog, or areas where I may have dropped water from washing dishes, etc. I also have to ensure that all the wires, and stuff on the floor are put away to make sure the robot doesn't get caught.
- The battery seems a little bit of a drain. One cleaning reduces the battery all the way to 60%, not sure if that's normal, but I figured since it's new, it'll be at maybe 80% or have a power save function.
- The collecting bin should come with some cleaning instruction, I want to make sure this bad boy stays with me for a long while, so I like to learn how to keep the seal that keeps the bin closed tight, remains in tact. It's made of like a soft sponge material, and feel it'll degrade after a few dumps (we'll see).
- After researching a few models, I wish this also had the swiffer pad attachment or something so that it could polish or mop the floor as well. I know it doesn't always pick up the super tiny dust bunnies, but that pad would be amazing

Overall, I give it a solid 90%. I've only had it for a little over a month, and I hope I have many years with this thing. If you haven't given a robot vacuum a try, I'd definitely recommend it....coming from someone that despised them.","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2024"
4,"Self empty, bag less.","I like the self empty bag less, voice control and mapping. I don't like the loud sound it made while vacuuming on the hard floor, but it is quiet on the carpet.

And I’ll get it figured out!! ( I’m stubborn. )May have to give up and chat with support.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024"
4,"Great, but Broken After 8 Months","Initially the Shark Robot was ideal! It would map and clean designated areas with little interference. Cleaning out the filter and emptying the dust holder was simple. Suction power and clean up was phenomenal. 5 STARS!

However as several months passed, the Robot began to generate errors.

YouTube/Shark had awesome videos on the error codes to remedy. One code for drive wheel error kept shutting down the machine.

After talking to customer service the option was to return the entire machine and base and Shark would fix the drive wheel for free. I would just need to pay the $90.00 shipping fee to return it to me.

YouTube had various videos on this common problem and had an instructional on how to change the wheel at home. Finding the drive wheel was a challenge.

After contacting Shark and customer service, they indicated I should just purchase an entire new system and sent me a coupon for 10% off. I grumbled at the cost after the 10% and the next day received a coupon for 30% off…select items only.

Needless to say the 8 month old, very expensive Shark robot remains inactive. In reading other reviews this is a common issue. The electrical connection from the drive wheel to the wire was not connected all the way- when the robot making the Shark connected the port to the wheel several of the connector prongs were bent. Robot error in making another robot? For breakage after 8 months: STARS

I remain in search of a drive wheel for my Robot. Until then, I am disappointed that my Shark is not cleaning.

August 4, 2024. Found Right sided drive wheel for Shark. $89.00. It was difficult because they were either out of stock or not available. This makes me think there is an issue with the right drive wheel. Plenty of Left Drive Wheels are available. We noted that there were several prongs that were not like the NEW Drive wheel - so perhaps a defect in the Old Drive Wheel. The adapter connected perfectly to the NEW Wheel. Once we reattached the NEW RIGHT drive wheel, the Shark is back to normal. 4 STARS.","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024"

4,REVIEW: Shark AI Ultra Voice Control Robot Vacuum,"Purchased the Shark AI Ultra Voice Control Robot Vacuum about 6-weeks ago and was immediately impressed:

1) Packaging, instructions, 100% EASE OF SET-UP, Wi-Fi, phone app, etc...miles ahead! Just a totally different and clearly BETTER process than my last (different brand) vacuum robot.

2) This vacuum is smart and very quick to learn your home...also VERY thorough in its cleaning patterns. This vacuum is VERY quiet when compared to our last robot vacuum (different brand)...it literally makes < 1/2 the noise of the prior one. This vacuum provides cleaning reports through the phone app with every finished cycle...you can see how long it ran and the entire footprint/area it cleaned (see pics).

3) THE BAGLESS COLLECTION TOWER IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN COLLECTION BAGS!!! We have 3-dogs and a cat, so no 60-day capacity here (not gonna lie); I've emptied it once already and it was about 1/2 way full when I did. I have my unit programmed to run on Mon/Wed/Fri (again, programming, set-up VERY easy). I probably could have gotten 45-days out the bagless collection tower/bin prior to emptying it. For a normal home that doesn't have as many pets as we do, 60+ days is an absolute yes on the collection bin/emptying.

4) The only minor concerns I have, which haven't presented any problems yet. Our home is 1,800 SF but the floor area Flo (my robot) cleans is only ~ 1,250 SF, and it takes her ~120 mins:
a) The dust collection tray in the vacuum itself is small, which causes it to return to the tower (and empty) while it's cleaning our home. NO problem as the unit picks-up right where it left-off.
b) The battery life doesn't allow the vacuum to complete a cycle before it needs to re-charge (once) while its cleaning our home. Again, NO problem as the unit picks-up right where it left-off after restoring its charge.

Due to a recent bad experience with a failed battery w/our last robot vacuum (didn't last 16-months), I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU PURCHASE THE 3-YEAR EXTENDED WARRANTY. It only costs $37 and will be well worth it if the battery on this unit does actually begin to fail prematurely like the last unit (different brand) I bought. To replace the battery on my old unit was going to cost me $110 + shipping. No way!! so I decided to just replace it.","Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024"

4,Battery takes a while to charge,"I have a 1500 square-foot home and this machine can vacuum it without a problem, with about 60% battery life after it’s done.

The battery does take a while to recharge though, which may be a good thing in the long run—trickle charge to prolong the battery life.

Be sure to pick up everything off of the floor for the initial exploration, the robot will adapt to new items on the floor after that—things under an inch might still just get ran over.","Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2024"
4,Overall it's OK,"This is a feedback after using one week. Overall, I would give 4.5 out of 5. It cleans 90%-95% of my first floor including carpet family room.
Pros:
I have two cats, so I did test the carpet family room with my regular vacuum after its cleaning work. It does pick up majority of cat hair, just a little missed. I am OK with that.
The noise is OK when it's cleaning floors. I have an old iRobot purchased years ago, and its noise is much louder compared to Shark.
The mapping is pretty accurate. I am very impressed!
It's surprisingly intelligent. It states self-emptying base holds up to 60 days of dirt and debris, I didn't think about to check dirt box on the 4th day after I used it. When I gave the order to clean the rooms, it told me I need to empty my dirt box first! So if you have any pet like I do (2 cats), you may need to be ready to empty that box less than one week!

Cons:
Inside the box, there are only two sheets. One is to show you how to set up, the other is related to the APP. It doesn't have any handbook to introduce the product's parts, which is what I am looking for. I don't want to damage my new cleaning toy. I would feel more comfortable, i.e. empty the dirt box, trying to take the filters off with the direction of handbook.
So far, I only did mapping for my first floor. I don't know if I can add another mapping for my second floor.","Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2024"

4,Staying,"We bought this robot vac after our Neato vac’s battery needed to be replaced and we learned the company went out of business.
This vac navigates better, the set up was easier, and I like the feature that lets you name rooms so you can direct it to clean only certain rooms. The self-emptying feature is also a plus.
Our house is around 2600 sq. ft and to do the whole house takes a lengthy recharge in the middle of cleaning. It does a good job of getting out of tight spots and is quieter than I expected. However, I don’t believe it cleans as well as our old Neato, especially on our rugs. But since we only have a couple of rugs and no carpeting, I can live with that.","Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2024"
4,Placement of Docking/Charging Station,"I had to return this Shark vacuum without ever using it. I opened the box and read the instructions, which said to place the docking/charging station on a hard surface. I have both hardwood floors and carpeted floors, but the best place for my docking station would be in a carpeted room. I called the Customer Service number in the instruction booklet and told him my situation. He said if it is on carpet the robot may not be able to dock properly and therefore would not charge properly. How I wish this had been clear in the online description before I bought it!
My brother has this same vacuum and absolutely loves it. His docking station is on a hard surface so he didn't have my issue.
Hopefully this will help someone else when considering this purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2024"
4,"If it needs warranty, you'll get a substandard replacement","""Larry"" worked great for 6 months. Then one day randomly reported an obstruction. One of the side brushes was rotating slower than the other. After talking to tech support, they started a replacement of just the robot. After 2 weeks, we contacted then and they ""determined"" that they didn't have this model anymore and that we would now get a complete replacement (base and robot.)

The replacement is a newer model with only 1 side brush, that does not extend beyond the side of the robot. Additionally, it is horribly loud. After searching the interwebs, various ""fixes"" such as random bits of tape were tried and we gave up. The replacement - sucks. Except not in the preferred manner. Suction on this unit is less than the previous. It struggles to suck up tiny pieces of litter.","Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2024"

4,Check your Shark robot’s model number upon receipt!,"While I do like this Shark Robot, it isn’t what I ordered. It superficially looks the same as the one pictured in Amazon’s listing, but at least one feature is different (one side brush, not two); and, there may be other differences that I have not discovered. The model number for my robot is not RV2001AE, but another model that is not listed in Shark’s current catalog. Otherwise, it works fine, and the self-empty feature is handy. For you prospective buyers, bear in mind that the “self-cleaning” brush roll is that IF there isn’t a lot of human and/or pet hair on your floors and carpets — you WILL need manually clean the brush from time to time. (Fortunately, Shark has designed the brush for easy, tool-less removal.). Also, before first use, thoroughly vacuum all floors and carpets manually. The Sharp app is OK, but its mapping is somewhat crude (but works). Suction is good, battery life acceptable, the self docking-and-recharge feature is important and useful. Finally, this model Sharp Robot is surprisingly quiet (I cannot tell any difference, noise-wise, berween “eco” and “normal” mode, although battery life is noticeably longer in “eco”). Overall, a good starter smart robot vac.","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2024"

Other than that I've had no problems with it and it's been working ever since I bought it.","Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2024"
4,First impression is this thing is very clunky.,"Update to the update...
So now this thing is working better. You've got to let this thing charge like 100%. Let it map the house. Then it works pretty good. It got stuck a couple times on some obstacles but I'm not going to knock that. Once you vacuum proof AKA childproof your floor. It'll work fine. Every time it's done vacuuming it dumps itself which is The first time I've ever had a dumping vacuum. It is definitely nice not to bend over and pull that dust bin out all the time with dogs. All in all I'm pretty happy with it. I'm knocking off a star because this thing is clunky. Even brand new it sounds like it's breaking. It's got like a grinding crunching noise when the bar spins underneath the machine. You also can't zoom into maps and see little tracks where the unit has run. Other vacuums has little trails on where the unit went. This just tells you it did that room in general. It would be nice to see the exact route this thing took so I can see if I have to put a no-go zone somewhere. Make sure you get it on sale and it's worth the money. End of story unless it breaks and I'll report back.

Update:
Let it charge over 50% before you use it. When I set it up the app kind of let me run it right away and instead of mapping the house it just started cleaning. I put it back on the charger and let it go to 100%. It seems to charge very very slow compared to my last one.
Once it was 100% charged it did map the house in about 15 mins and then it dumped itself and I set it off to clean. Seems to work pretty good over all. Lots of dog hair and dirt in the hopper. I will report back after a few weeks. So far I am happier than I was when I first got it so we will see.
 
I think it's important to log your first impression so here we go. It was well packaged I was pleased to see that. It takes up a good bit of space in your house so find a nice piece of wall. It had 30% charge when I set it up and for some reason it wanted to get started mapping my house so I let it. I'm coming off of a wyze vacuum cleaner. I had bought it twice from Amazon and I like it but some reason after a year the suction just seems to die down and no matter how much air I blow through it it doesn't seem to clean it out. Thus this replacement. My first thoughts is it's like watching Grandpa walk around when he's lost at home. The thing bumps into everything with no hope of actually having a plan. It still mapping my house so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt. Right now I'm not so impressed with the suction. I don't know if it slow suction down while it maps the house or what. It might be a little early to leave a review but I think it's important again to explain this in detail. Right now I've got a lot of doubt but will give it a couple days and I'll report back. One thing I really don't like is right now when I press dock it went the complete wrong way and decided to not dock. I liked the Waze vacuum cleaner because it went right to its home and knew everything was. I hope this works out better than my first impression.","Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024"
4,Brush really not self cleaning,"I have noticed the quality of all the robotic vacuums has declined over the years. I had to replace my Neato brand and since they had gone out of business I decided to try the Shark brand. I wasn’t thrilled about the self emptying features since the unit takes up more space but I wanted a vacuum with mapping capability so I chose the Shark. It takes longer to run compared to my previous models but does a decent job cleaning. I noticed it will not cross over metal thresholds even if they are flush to the floor which means it won’t enter some of my rooms. I don’t find it e trembly noisy but usually run it when I am not around.
I guess the one issue I have with it is the “self cleaning” brush roll. As shown in the pictures this is not the case in my household. I do have long hair but I didn’t have this much of an issue with my previous units. Otherwise it is a decent vacuum for the money","Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024"

4,After 6 months & shed season,"TLDR: Been a lifesaver on hard floors, not a replacement for vacuuming on carpets. You do have to clean the vacuum parts every once in a while. will get stuck on fabrics on the ground (clothes, dryer sheets, etc)

After having this for about 6 months I would recommend the vacuum for someone who has a lot of hard floors or regular dry messes but not to someone with spills or a lot of carpet-to-wood floor changes if they have heavy shedders. It's helped tremendously with the dust in our house as long as we clean the dust filter regularly.

With shedding: We have three almost 100 lb dogs which are heavy shedders and live in a very dusty place. We run it every day and even through shed season, our floors looked great! It doesn't get the hair as much off our carpet so we still vacuum the carpets once a week or every other week. If we had done that before it would have looked like a hair storm went through our house! The brush roll did get stuck quite a bit at first but some WD40 and popping both ends off the roller to clean them helped. One end of the roller does not want to come off at first but once you get it, it's easy to clean. With the 60-day tank, we dump it about twice a month so I think for a normal household it would last 60 days.

Initial setup: it was frustrating because it didn't map the house how I wanted it to. I must've mapped the house 4 times before getting one that was similar to ours. It helps to push the manual button to clean and it helps it map much better.

Carpet vs hard flooring: It functions great on all our tile, wood flooring, and even cement( escaped into our garage one day when on ""clean mode"" not mapped). The main issue we've had is the transition onto the carpet, the brush roll cleans off all the hair so all the rooms we have carpet in now have a line of dog hair entering the room. I think it would be pretty good for someone who has fewer dogs. Once it's on the carpet it works great, even makes those lines in the carpet. Picks up dirt very well on carpet and hard flooring.

Noise: It's a background noise when vacuuming much like a dishwasher but when it's clearing the vacuum dustbin into the base it sounds like a normal vacuum.

App: works great. I do wish there was a feature to run certain rooms every day or different areas on different schedules. I think it would help a lot with the carpet-to-hardwood hair issue.","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024"

I have the iRobot before, and it was so loud, this robot is a godsend! Only bad thing I have to say, the no go lines don’t work unless you layer them up. I have the water dish on the floor and tried to create a no go line so it’d stop pushing it around and spilling… I had to layer 3 in order for it to recognize it is a legit no go area.","Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024"

4,I like this robot vacuum,"I like this so much I bought a second one for downstairs. It does a decent job on dog hair, though it does blow some hair around, but eventually it gets it.

4,"Vac is great, software hopefully better with updates","I have a small but very clean apartment. I've run the vac 3 times in a week to test mapping and to complete a couple cleanings. I'm surprised at the amount of dust etc this unit finds on my clean floors. I have bad allergies to pollen and dust, trees, grass, weeds; this is doing a good job keeping that in check. It's quieter than I was led to believe. ONLY FOUR STARS BECAUSE: The app leaves much to be desired. I've had to remap once already and will need to do it again. Biggest issue I have is creating ""no go"" zones - they seem to be set with a minimum size that is far too big for the spots I'm marking off. I have to give up a couple feet when I only need to mark one foot. The Lidar comes up with some mangy looking maps, too. Second try, I had to look at the space marked off to make sense of the orientation of the room compared to the mapping. Working on keeping it from climbing into low-lying things - it's like having a toddler or an untrained puppy, climbing into my entertainment center and some low lying storage spots. I ""hid"" a couple areas that it ignored during mapping but it went ""there"" anyway during cleaning. The app, fortunately, is something I expect will get better with software upgrades.","Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2024"

4,Great vacuum for small daily cleans,"This vacuum works great for dog hair. I run this every day while I am at work and it takes approximately 3 hrs to clean 1800 sqft in a single floor home with the matrix clean mode.

If you have pets I would recommend cleaning it at least once a week. The 1st picture is of just 2 days of cleaning with one German Shepherd.

Ever since I started using this vacuum I no longer notice any tumbleweeds and it has significantly cut down on the Dust and pet dander.

I would however recommend if you have carpet that whenever you first get it to remove the three screws (2nd Pic) that hold the brush assembly in the bottom. I kept getting notifications and finding it randomly sitting in rooms because the brush gets clogged with hair and carpet fiber on the bearing surfaces causing it to get stuck.

If you include that in the weekly cleaning you will have no issues.","Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2024"
4,great for the price,This robot is working great for our family home so far. It has mapped the main floor perfectly.

4,Senior Citizens Little Helper,"Arrived on time. Packaged very well. Sale price was awesome. I purchased the vacuum two weeks ago and wanted to wait before I made a fair review.
The first thing you do is plug it in to finish charging up the battery. I didn't use it until the next day. In the meantime, download the app and connect the vacuum to the internet. This was the most difficult part for me. It kept saying to reboot the modem, reboot the vacuum, reboot... But after several times, it finally did connect to the wifi, so be patient. The app itself is user friendly. I played around with it just to figure it all out. (And you get to name your vacuum as this point.) The next day, I let Jaws map the house. He was fun to watch as he went from room to room, turning, stopping and going, spinning and looking around. After he finished mapping, he went back to the dock. This is when you label the rooms and make no-go zones in the app. Just a tip about no-go zones. Pinch the map to make the area larger so you can clearly see exactly where you want to put the no-go zone--otherwise it's too small to see where you want it. Once you are satisfied with that, you can send him out to clean a single room, multiple rooms or the entire house. And you can choose the power level of cleaning. In settings, there are a few other choices like do not disturb, recharge and resume, evacuate and resume, etc. I sent Jaws out to clean a room at a time just so I could see where he went, what he cleaned and if he missed any areas. When that was all done, I realized that I had to remap the house again. This is a minor flaw with the app. You have to map the entire house and can't map one room at a time. There were some areas that he missed but I think it was more my fault than his. In the app, trying to distinguish exactly where one room ends and another begins is not exact. Instead of labeling every single room, for instance, I made my master bedroom with adjoining bathroom and adjoining walk-in closet as one huge room. I did that also for the guest bedroom--the hallway and guest bathroom and the guest bedroom were mapped as one room. You will know what I mean once you are actually in the app and mapping and labeling your rooms. But if you want to, you can label every single room, large or small, especially if you think any of those rooms need a touch up more than others. By the way, after cleaning three fairly large rooms, the battery only went down to about 70%. The vacuum picks up surface dirt: crumbs, dust bunnies, cat fur and litter, etc., and some deep stuff. I still own a regular vacuum for very deep cleaning but now use it less often. Otherwise, I use Jaws every day. I am a senior citizen and don't want to spend my retirement thinking about dragging out the big vacuum. I love it. You learn after a few runs what you need to pick up or move out of the way beforehand. I found that out after Jaws went into the kitchen for the first time and attacked the cat food and water bowls. But you learn all this as you go along. I ended up making about five maps all together before I was totally satisfied knowing that most, if not all, of the rooms were getting cleaned. For some reason, it misses a very small 2'x2' corner in my bedroom. Doesn't want to go over there. It might have something to do with a no-go zone close by. Rather than make another map of the ENTIRE house, I am ok with the map that I ended up with. Other than that small area, he cleans the rest of the house to my satisfaction. Jaws spoke to me today and said to clean the filter. There was a clump of dust bunnies and cat fur blocking the poop door. Smart fellow. Almost forgot: I attempted to set it up with Alexa to use verbal commands but for some reason, it wouldn't work for me. I could have spent more time trying to figure it out but it's just as easy for me to use the app. Money well spent. I also purchased a two-year warranty so I'll end up with three years of protection. And I bought a kit of replacement parts, filters, etc. No regrets. Jaws and I have become good friends even if he wants to eat the cat food.","Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2024"

4,Works pretty well,"I've had several robot vacuums, from cheap to expensive, and this one does a good job of actual cleaning. It does get stuck and confused more often than the cheap Eufy that it replaced. It insists on getting stuck on a floor vent at least once every few days because it thinks it's going to fall.

The rug in the picture confuses it for some reason. I don't know how it decides its path, but it constantly changes direction and misses sections of the rug. If I pull up the rug, it has no problem on the hardwood floor. Out of the three vacuums I've tried in this room, it's the only one that runs erratically on the rug.

I still recommend it as it does work great everywhere else.","Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2024"
3,“Trash”,"I have to say, I am extremely disappointed with this vacuum. As a loyal Shark customer and a three-time owner of Shark robot vacuums, I had high expectations, but this model has been a letdown on all fronts.

At its premium price point, I expected superior performance, but this is by far the loudest, least efficient, and most underwhelming vacuum I’ve owned. Despite its high cost, it delivers subpar cleaning results compared to previous models. It’s so bad that I am seriously considering returning it, but living in a rural area makes that process inconvenient, especially since I’ve already given away my previous vacuum.

If you’re considering this model, I highly recommend looking at Shark’s more affordable options. In my experience, they perform significantly better at a fraction of the price. This model has been a major disappointment, and I regret my purchase.

I hope this feedback helps others make a more informed decision.","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2024"
3,Great Cleaner but No-Go Zone Feature Does Not Work,We have had the The AV251WAXUS robot vacuum for 4 months. The robot does a great job of cleaning! We have a Labrador retriever that sheds constantly and would be a challenge for any robot vacuum. The extent of the shedding fills the “60-day” capacity self-empty base with hair after 2 vacuuming rounds! This isn’t a big deal as we just empty the base every 2 days and appreciate not having to manually vacuum the room each day. We have only had one difficulty and that is the No-Go zones. You can program No-Go zones with the Sharp app. It does not work no matter how many times I have tried to redo the map. That was a disappointment. We have an end table with a 1” solid wood base that the robot tries to climb over every time wasting time and battery charge. I’ve had to place a 2” by 2” in front of the table base (see photo) prior to each vacuuming which is annoying. This feature should work and it is very hard to get help from Sharp. Were it not for this problem I would have given the robot a 5-star rating.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

If you think the website is useful, you are wrong. If you think you can find a real model number to search it, you are wrong. But I gotta give it to it, its quiet,, until it needs to empty the robot. It keeps locking itself in rooms, keeps getting itself stuck in weird places, and keeps not telling me about it you til I go home and realize its not in the dock.

Update: ive deleted the map, cleaned everything, re did the whole setup, but now it tries to explore for 10 ft and returns to dock. Honestly I really wish I could return it and buy something else.

For the first 40 days, I couldn't believe I had ever lived without one. However, somewhere after 40 days it gave us an error that the roller brush was stuck. I followed the directions to see what had happened and discovered mountains of hair was stuck in the roller and had even clogged one side of the roller preventing it from moving. I did my best to cut all the hair, but it never worked again. I called Shark customer service and they were great. They agreed that it shouldn't stop working after 40 days, especially because of hair clogging the roller, and they sent us a new robot. With our Shark upright vacuum, we could go 4+ months before I had to cut hair out of the roller. Now after every clean I cut hair out of the roller, making sure that the one end of the roller does not get clogged again. If I didn't have to do this after every clean, I would give the robot vacuum 5 stars, This is honestly my only complaint about it. And if Shark could figure out how to make a robot vacuum where hair didn't clogged up and stop the roller, I would buy it in a heart beat.","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2024"

I set up the map of my house, and it was pretty easy. However it doesn’t always clean the complete area. It misses a lot of the areas it’s set up to clean. Where it does clean it does a good job. The main things I do not like is at least 1-2 times a week it disconnects from WiFi. I have to completely delete the robot, and redo everything, maps, renaming etc. it’s very frustrating. The Roomba was much easier to reconnect if it did disconnect from WiFi (which only happened once in a year when our internet went down). The app is not helpful with troubleshooting either.

3,"Good Features, but Lacks in Performance","While this robot vacuum has some impressive features, like voice control, home mapping, and a self-emptying base, I found the overall performance to be underwhelming. The Matrix Clean Navigation does a decent job on hard floors, but on carpets, it often misses spots and struggles with deeper cleaning.

The 60-day capacity and self-emptying feature are convenient, especially for pet owners, but I expected a bit more efficiency in terms of navigation and thoroughness.

3,The software is the weak link,"I was given one as a birthday present.

If you want room customization (which is about the only thing you
can't get with just using the manual buttons), you have to use the app
and wifi, which is only available on a phone or IOS, not from the desktop, and requires
a login plus bluetooth.

It doesn't supports 5mhz wifi, so with some dual-band routers it's a
pain and inconvenient to disable 5mhz.

The clean button should be labeled clean/pause.

The map doesn't expand in real time, nor does it show the device location.
You would think with each cleaning it would explore untried areas
first, but instead it revisits areas already cleaned before trying new
regions, thereby taking a long time to expand the map to the full
house. Eg, it still hasn't found my guest bedroom after repeated runs.

Apparently you can't edit/restrict the map until it thinks it found
the entire layout. That's going to take weeks with its current random
exploration method. It would be a lot faster to simply follow every outer wall to
get a complete outline.

Although it has obviously explored more than the map currently shows,
the map still isn't updated. Are the company servers the
bottleneck for mapping? If so, it would be much better to have the map
on-device, with simple finger-tip app drawing to expand map edges and
let the robot reduce the map to what it can't reach.

It often drops dust bunnies behind in random spots. The clear fill window
immediately gets so dusty you can't tell how full the bin really is.

For cleaning behind open doors, and around corners and furniture feet,
it's probably generally faster and better just to use a vacuum. In
fact, it's not clear to me how you can ever get it to clean behind open doors.

It can't sense obstacles unless it bumps into them, so you constantly
hear it banging around, sometimes surprisingly loudly; lidar would be
an improvement.

In general, just like cars and washing machines, and all other
manufacturers, they're making you rely on a network connection to them
for features that could have been included, while collecting data on
you (or, for some products, to upsell you). It's a very bad trend,
because the implementations and limitations are often so bad.

Overall i guess I'd give the shark a c-minus. Better software could
easily raise it to a ""B"". Making it self-contained instead of needing
the web would make it an ""A"".","Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2024"

3,A little underwhelmed with its performance,"If your floors are already pretty clean, then you'll like this robot just fine. If you have pets who shed and kids who drop food everywhere, particularly along walls for some reason, you probably won't be impressed. I have a long-haired cat who is shedding his undercoat right now and the robot really struggles to pick up the clumps on carpet. I would pick up the clump and drop it in front of the robot, but that didn't work. I have to go in behind it with a stick vacuum. Despite having two little edge brushes, it's horrible at picking things up along walls, so I have to use my stick vac again. It also gets stuck on my bathroom mats. I had an iRobot back in the day, and it had a feature where it would sense dirtier areas and spot clean them more thoroughly automatically. I wish this robot had that feature. The other thing I don't like is that you can't program it to clean specific rooms at specific times. The only option is to program the robot to clean all the mapped areas at a specific time, which also means you can't use the matrix clean feature. I like the matrix clean feature, but you can only use it if you clean one room at a time or spot clean a small area.

Don't get me wrong. I don't regret this purchase and I am glad I have it because my house still gets vacuumed more than it would if I didn't have it, but there's room for improvement. I love that it self empties. It's pretty easy to empty the bin (although there's no way that bin can hold 60 days worth of dirt) and untangle the brushes. I like that it makes a map of your home and you can create different rooms, but I wish you could remap specific rooms instead of having to remap your entire house or even delete things from the map. My cats must have been playing chicken with it while it was mapping my home because there are two, small, random spots on the map that the robot avoids. It's pretty quiet except when it's emptying its contents, but even that's not too bad.","Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2024"
3,"Works, Kind of","Bought this primarily to clean laminate flooring -- especially scattered litter from my cats. It is OK for cleaning small bits, but for larger piles it just spreads it around. The major issues and the fact that I downgraded it is after 8 months the wifi connection failed so I can no longer use the phone app. I can still vacuum by pushing the clean button on the robot itself. Hopefully that will last awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024"

The robot itself is fantastic. I love the app, I love the noise level, I love the value. However, we’re very disappointed that I got an error message of my front bumper being jammed. After a full troubleshooting process, the robot needs to be replaced. Shark is charging me about $11, for shipping of the replacement drone body. I need to remove the brushes and the battery from the old drone, and put it into the new one. Also they were unable to supply the same color robot, white, in a timely fashion. I would’ve had to wait 30+ days to get a white robot replaced. Disappointed, because I really loved the performance of this drone thus far.","Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2024"

3,Awesome if you don't have multiple pets.,"I purchased this new July 5, 2024 and I can honestly say if I did NOT have pets I would probably love it.

I have 3 rescue dogs and an ancient cat so keeping my hardwood floors hair free is a major, constant, challenge. From all the wonderful reviews I read I was hoping that this vacuum could handle a daily sweep of the main areas of my home but the poor thing just can't handle it. I'm freeing the stuck roller and unclogging the robot at least every other week.

If I DIDN'T have pets though, I would LOVE this product! It really would do an excellent job for the average home.","Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024"

3,Good idea - but it has given us many problems.,"Often sends us notifications, asking us to remove hair or dust clots from this or that wheel or roller brush. The sensors also sometimes become dusty within a week or two, and do not work, correctly. Thus, the robot vacuum numbs into the walls or objects like a piano stool multiple times (6-8) before going around it and moving on.

I’m not saying it should be pristine in movability - I understand this technology is a little fresh. They really need to work on the A.I. algorithms, though. When it is working, it does a decent job picking up hair and dust that is in the middle or toward the edges of the halls and our home’s 5-room floors. I had to use our manual Dyson to get the dust and hair at the edge of the hallway.

I do like that the Robot Vac finds its way under beds and sofas, which we rarely do. Thanks!","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2024"

3,Wanted to give 3 1/2 stars,"I’ve been using this Shark robotic vacuum for about eight months now. So I want to give an honest review. Wanted to give it about 3 1/2 stars, but since that’s not an option, I downgraded to three stars because didn’t really feel like it was worth 4 stars.

Pros: Easy to set up. Love that you can program to clean on a regular bases or designate various rooms to be cleaned. Love the self emptying dustbin and this is the reason I purchased this vacuum.

Cons: It says it’s good with pet hair. It’s really not. Maybe with very short pet hair. I have a mini aussie and it doesn’t do a good job. It does get some of it, but some of it that it picks up it also smears across rugs. Also, the roller brush smaller than previous brand robotic vacuum, I’ve used so it takes many more laps to clean the same area as my former brand and thus much longer.

Conclusion: When I need a new robotic vacuum, I will try to find the things that I like about this Shark vacuum in my former Neato brand.","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2024"
3,Frustrating!,"Love this vacuum for its ability to clean, but it has a tendency to forget where it's been or where it's supposed to go next. Today it cleaned the master bedroom twice, the bathroom and hall twice and ignored the other two bedroom. After wandering back into the living area it finally remembered the other rooms and returned to clean them. Then it's clean the hall again and back to the kitchen and around to the living area. I finally just told it to return to the dock where it then announced that the job was complete. The map showed that it ran for about 45 minutes and cleaned 1/2 the house when in actuality it ran for over 90 minutes and cleaned some areas twice. It appears that once it cleaned some areas twice it assumed that it was through and after remembering the missed rooms simply began over again and erased from memory what had already been cleaned. Would never trust it to clean while I'm asleep or not at home. It has to be constantly monitored for these glitches. That being said, it is super quiet except when emptying and does a decent job cleaning the floors. But there's definitely no schedule and forget option, which is what I was hoping for.","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2024"

3,Works nice but,"I had been looking to replace the older irobot that I had and this one came on sell. It looked like it would be great, self empting, floor mapping, continue were it left off, good for houses with dogs.
And that is the only problem I have with it. It fills up the collection bin alot faster than 60 days and will get plugged and not be able to empty itself. Leave clops of hair as it keeps trying to continue vacuuming.","Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2024"
3,Works well but has flaws,"This review will based on my experiences with the robot vacuum compared to my Roomba i7+.

I had the roomba i7+ with the self emptying feature for 6 years and loved it but it was falking apart and needed an upgrade. I had been researching this product for a while before purchasing and was satisfied until I started using it. We have 4 dogs and daily vacuuming is necessary in our home.

1. The mapping run was quick and accurate after only 30 minutes where my Roomba would take multiple runs to finish. However, the map was awkward to setup. I have 3000sqft home with several rooms. Some of the areas are smaller than others which requires tailoring of the map. The map will only allow rectangular or square shapes and have a minimum size requirement. This didn't work for our setup. The Roomba would allow me to make odd shapes to fir my layout and mapping desires.

2. The biggest selling point for me was the bag less self emptying feature. The roomba has bags in the tower that holds contents after clean out. This one does not.

3. My biggest gripe with this vacuum is the dust bin on the vacuum does not have full bin sensors where the roomba does. Why is this an issue? Well, like I said, 4 dogs and 3000sqft. This robot only empties every 30 mins. With our dogs and home size, this doesn't work. After the bin is full, the robot continues on its way for 30 minutes. This causes the dog hair to be compacted into the brush roll and port of the dust bin reducing its cleaning abilities. I was constantly having to empty the bin manually, remove clogs, and clean the brush roller.

4. For the good parts. The robot cleans very well until the bin is full. The Li-Dar mapping is fast and accurate. The variable suction power is an amazing feature. Setting up cleaning runs is fast and intuitive. The overall app experience is good, as well. Cleaning are much faster and more effective than the Roomba, until the bin is full. The Mayrix clean feature is awesome for high traffic areas.

Overall, this vacuum is great but there are some features that I was looking for that weren't apparently missing untilbi started using it.

Hope this reviews helps to answer questions for others that I was searching for and couldn't find!","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

3,Still going strong after 4 1/2 years… still doesn’t see obstacles very well,"3.5 stars overall.

I bought the RV1001AE back in November of 2019 and am just now looking at a replacement. Not due to product failure but because I’m looking at a 2-in-1 to save time and floor space etc. In a time when most appliances seem to have planned obsolescence it’s worth noting this is still a very good machine after almost 5 years of regular use.

For context-
I have one cat, hardwood floors, and no carpet just a few low pile area rugs. It works well for me on a single level with 900 -1200 sqft apartments I’ve had.

Works well on hard wood and ok on small area rugs. Cleans up cat litter and hair well in general.
———
Noisy. Not as much as an upright or stick vacuum but still very noisy due to the mars-rover style wheels and emptying into the canister.

It will get stuck at least once a week but this is probably fixed with better sensors in the newer models by now.

This version has single pass only and I’ve noticed it can get turned around by my cat or myself if I move something in or out of it’s planned path.

Does not see obstacles well and I would recommend watching it closely the first time and putting down strips for areas it shouldn’t go. For example it gets stuck inside of a side table we have. It will go over the base and go around in circles and can’t get out again. It also likes to vacuum over the base of our floor lamps and my standing desk legs and my desk chair legs then gets stuck between the chair wheels or gets lost.

I try to schedule for a time I’m going to be away because it also takes about 2 hours to clean my 900 sqft apartment (because it gets stuck or turned around a lot) and it’s very loud with the wheels hitting things. Just need to make sure to pick up any cords or cat toys etc before leaving.

From what I can tell the matrix version uses a different system entirely instead of a single camera eye looking at the ceiling. If you can afford the upgrade I’d recommend the matrix version - it may not have as much clearance to go under stuff but it’s probably better at navigating spaces and won’t need as much supervision.

———
Highly recommend following the directions and cleaning it regularly.

If any of the filters get too dusty it doesn’t work as well. (Which may be common sense but easy to forget when it has the canister)

Sometimes it will try to empty a few times because the back doesn’t line up perfectly. That’s because either the base moved a bit or it can’t get enough suction to empty into the canister. Easy to take apart and clean if that happens and also easy to troubleshoot in general.

Mapping on the app is “just ok” but that’s the norm for an older model.","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024"

3,It doesn’t recognize doggie doo,"I was so excited to finally buy my Shark! It was cool how it mapped itself out and even told me when something was amiss.
I’m relaxing reading a book because now I have extra time( vacuum is taking care of itself.) all of a sudden I get an awful whiff of dog poop. Needless to say my pup had an accident and good old sharks decided to carry it all over the house. Unfortunately I didn’t realize this error being on the other side of the house enjoying my book.
I threw away my area rug that was custom cut and bound for the specific area and spent probably 2 hours trying to get the poop out of the wheels and brushes. Do you know how many grooves are on a shark vacuum wheel? I do now.
So, if you have puppies or animals that have occasional accidents, I do not recommend this product. If you’re animal free, it’s a great product. You just have to rescue it from behind the toilet every now and again.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2024"

3,Good While it Lasts,"First off it's pretty deceitful that they present reviews from many models on the same listing. I'm reviewing the Shark RV1001AE IQ Robot Self-Empty XL; AKA Carlos. Purchased in June of 2021...back when dinosaurs roamed the earth. Paid just shy of $350 for it (maybe on sale 50% IDRemember). When Carlos arrived I wanted to love him...and I did for about the first 1.5 years. Did he ever do a FANTASTIC job cleaning? No. But lets be real; it's not made to replace a standard vacuum, just allow you to use it much less often and THAT Carlos did! I have long hair that sheds everywhere, we live on a farm, have 2 indoor short hair Dachshunds, and 2 teenage boys (after proofreading this apparently my husband is doesn't contribute to the messy floor ;) ). There are 3 main entry doors that criss cross the living space and no one takes off their shoes....or boots at the door. Plenty of DIRT gets on our floor, and I hate to vacuum so, for the first year Carlos was godsent. Never had connections problems, although it is near impossible to use verbal commands through Alexa with the Shark app, never ran that down. I just programed a whole house/common areas cleaning everyday. The mapping was pretty shoddy the first go round, better after a delete and remap. Not perfect but acceptable. There were quarks from the get go but they have become exponentially worse over time to the point of writing this; literally 9 days out of 10 Carlos has some issue and doesn't clean the floor. When he does, he gets lost and confused like a drunkard just wonders around in little circles bumping into things and I have to pick him up and carry him home. Be aware that your floors have to be clean before Shark can ""clean"" them. That is to say you will need to remind them ""the living room is not your laundry hamper"" and pick up your kids socks, roll up their (insert electronic device name here) charging cords, barricade small Christmas Trees (Carlos HATES small Christmas Trees and will take them down with extreme prejudice!!!), Throw away any wayward dryer sheets that may have fallen on the floor and hide your shoes. One of Carlos' favorite games is to chuff one shoe off and hide it from you real good. You have to do all this or Carlos will run over and tightly wrap up in his roller or wheels every sock, dryer sheet, cord, shoe lace or dog blanket in his territory. I digress. I think the main issue is that Shark lost focus of the main issue; which is to clean the floor so we don't have to. Bells and whistles are nice; I bought it for some of the bells. But they've gotten preoccupied with making software that's missed the mark so widely that it's messing with the hardware. Carlos is much like a stray barn cat now. Mostly I don't know where he is or what he's doing, but he's not bothering anything and sometimes he shows up and catches a mouse so we let him sleep in the corner. The difference is I paid $350 for Carlos and I expected him to do better and last longer. I no longer recommend the Shark Robot Vacs and would not buy again at this price point. Please enjoy this picture of Carlos after I removed him from the CLIFF!! (not even any stairs, ledges, or even tall thresholds in our house) and got him back home to charge. Please forgive the splotch on him, a kid thought it was ok to unplug a B&B works wall flower and LAY it on Carlos where it promptly leaked out. BTW whatever is in those wall flower scents will melt right into the plastic of a Shark! Carlos is currently problem solving how to escape from the trap of the magnetic strip and VERY LOW profile rug he is ""caught"" between? The 2 floors are 100% flush with each other. He's been at it for 20 minutes now, stumbling around in that same 2 square foot area...and he's getting on my nerves.","Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2024"

The other downside is, it is very loud. Infant older versions are much quieter, (my brother owns and older model and it cleans better and it quiet). There are better products. This wasn't cheap.

It took almost 15 minutes for the vacuum to keep coming back and forth in the dock and not being able to go back. I had to put it back my self.

I have also noticed that it is a lot louder than other robot vacuums and it keeps giving me an error that it’s wheel is stuck.

3,Lasted 1.5 years. Works well with maintaining fur.,"I really liked this vacuum. I feel like the first year it worked well (purchased October 2022, stopped working June 2024) and I noticed that maybe over the last six months or so it seemed to be struggling more and more. The arm brushed kept breaking and falling off. It would have difficulty with other things like the suction being clogged. Kind of small things when dealing with a 120lb Great Pyrenees dog and a small cat. Pet fur everywhere at my house. But just this week it stopped working. It says the brush roll is stuck. I have cleaned it up as much as I can and I don't see any reason for it to be stuck. I think it has just given out. My favorite thing about this vacuum was that I didn't really have to think about it as it is self emptying. I will say my least favorite is that it still bumped into walls and got stuck in certain places, so while It was smarter than others I've had, it still struggled a bit. I'm bummed that it's not working and considering buying another of the same kind. I wish the arm brushed would stop breaking, so maybe that's reason enough to look into others first.","Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2024"

3,Works 75% of the time,"Purchased this vacuum in November 2022. It’s now June 2024 and I’m ready to replace it. The dust roll gets stuck a lot which is annoying because it will not continue and you have to search for the vacuum in the house. We have a dog and a cat so the vacuum is often put to work. As time goes by, even with routine cleaning and upkeep, the vacuum never seems to work at its full potential. The primary issue with it beyond all of that is that it refuses to vacuum unless it’s at at least 70%. Our house square footage is less than 1200 ft.² on one floor so it does about half of the house before it stops and recharges, even though the recharge and feature is turned off. the dustbin application is easy enough to maneuver, but getting the vacuum to shoot the dust into the dust Mann is always hit or miss causing You have to manually remove dust from the dust trap on the vacuum when it’s already docked. The Wi-Fi range on it is quite good however. And when it does work, it works really well. It’s just getting the actual items to work. Also, the warranty is basically nonexistent because the shark app does not seem to be compatible with this particular robot. The map feature is really nice but the integration with Alexa is not there yet.

-It picks up its fair share of dirt.
-Always finds dock easily.
-Text alerts let me know when it's stuck (and it's always stuck).
Cons:
-It's LOUD. 60dB. No squeaking to indicate bad belts or bearings, no debris or grime, barely 6 months old, has been run fewer than 10 times.
-Sounds like a helicopter. Clunks when switching from rug to floor, and back to rug. Kerchunks when it runs into a chair leg.
-It finds *something* to suck up and get stuck in its wheels or rollers with every run.
-Despite having the two-month version I have to empty the bin every 2 runs, and that's with a regular weekly pass over the floors with a Dyson. The bin isn't full when I'm notified that it needs to be emptied.","Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024"
3,"Very NOISY, not good on rugs, stuck on thresholds","Play Video
Review after one full emptying cycle (took about an hour). I live in a 1910 open floor plan unit with the old 3/4"" wood thresholds, and a mix of varnished floors, rugs, and area carpets. I had tried a Tikom robot vacuum from Amazon, and it got systematically stuck on the thresholds; this Shark does a bit better but still has difficulty.
This Shark is VERY NOISY, more so than my handheld Miele vacuum. It also does NOT CLEAN RUGS well and unlike the Timko, it does not increase suction on rugs. It does a good job on area carpets though. Another difference is that the brushes on the Timko have three arms, whereas the Shark has only one each, and this significantly reduces its pick-up ability. It's also a tad higher so that it doesn't fit under the center part of my couch, which causes it to be disoriented. Though it tries to follow regular lines, it often seems to do bonkers and spin on itself without purpose. On the rugs, I've also noticed that is bounces randomly...serious!
I'll give it a couple more days and maybe revise this review but it's most likely returning to Amazon.
NOTE that I bought this Amazon-refurbished unit, which may explain that it's not performing as well as it should (I've had a couple prior problems with Amazon refurbished items).","Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024"

3,Hard to clear hair from roller,"I wasn't impressed with the mapping software. You set it to explore and it does a vague map. When it cleans a few times, it learns your floor plan better. But the vacuum still tries to go down my stairwell. Magnetic strips don't stop it. I tried to use the ""no go"" lines, but they are large boxes, not lines.

The vacuum does pick up long hair. But it's not sucking the hair until the dust bin! Instead the hairs get wound around the brush roll ends. My other robot vacuums do the same. BUT the Shark vacuum roller has a small ""lip"" in orange in the picture. This keeps the hair on the roller and makes it practically impossible to remove the hair from the roller. : ( At least my Roomba i7 is incredibly easy to remove the hair!

But my favorite vacuum is my Neato D7. It picks up the most hair and dust. It's mapping software is great. The no-go lines are very precise. But sadly, 3 out of 3 vacuum have ended up spinning in circles due to a faulty wheel mechanism. : (","Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2024"
3,Wouldn't recommend,I got this vacuum because of all the positive reviews. No idea what I did wrong or maybe I got a defective one. But following the step by step directions it kept giving me an error 26 clogged filter code. It wasn't even used yet. No idea how that's possible. Well code finally went away and I tried connecting to my phone. Didn't connect. Tried my husband's and that didn't connect. I just ran it on clean without using our phone and I saw the vacuum pushing around a piece of dog kibble throughout my whole house. Didn't pick it up...

After speaking with shark customer service, I was told the 1 year warranty doesn’t cover a new battery, but the battery shouldn’t have lasted 3-4 years.

3,It’s great when it wants to work,"I bought this in December ‘23 and it was working fine however as of late I feel like I maintenance it more than it actually does its job. The vacuum likes to randomly work and function properly and then other times it sits in the dock with the red information light that can mean a million different things. (The manual doesn’t tell you anything useful on what this particular light means and you’ll have to go on Google). I take it apart and clean it (however there isn’t much to clean), I reboot the robot, I restart my router, I make sure there’s nothing in the actual dock itself that may be causing trouble to no avail. It’s like the vacuum has a mind of its own and chooses (sometimes the most inconvenient time) when to work if it feels like it. The product is quite pricey for it to function this way and I’m at a loss on what to do at this point.

When it works it’s amazing at picking up annoying crumbs that get on the floor and vacuums up the carpeted areas very well. When I use an actual vacuum on my cleaning day I hardly pick up anything. That’s how well this robot vacuum works and helps.","Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2024"

3,It’s lowkey dumb,"For the price, I cannot tell it where to go or what room to clean on schedule. It has an option to clean a specific room, but it always gets stuck and doesn’t come off the dock. The only thing I like is the schedule and the clean. I dislike it has to have light. I like the self emptying. It always has some random error. And I feel the “on sale” price was just marked up to fake a sale","Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2024"
3,Wouldn’t buy it again without some changes,"The vacuum itself is great. I love the self-emptying, and it does a great job on hard floors and short rugs. It does an okay job on carpet with pet hair, but that’s to be expected. What I really don’t like about the vacuum is 2 things:

1: It doesn’t dodge ANYTHING. It’s supposed to be great at detecting obstacles but it absolutely does not, so if we do ever have pet messes or stuff laying around, it’ll just run right over it and potentially get stuck or dirty.
2: There is no option for it to automatically run on the “matrix clean” setting (or the grid-like setting where it has a specific pattern to follow to make sure every inch is covered). I can send it to do the matrix clean for each individual room (literally one room at a time which is annoying) but I can’t schedule or send it to matrix clean the entire house. When it’s on an automatic schedule, or even if I just hit the “clean” button to have it go through the entire house, it has no specific pattern. It’ll miss entire sections of multiple rooms. I was gone for a week on vacation and had it set to vacuum every single day. I came back to dirt in random places all throughout the house because it just totally missed some sections. I spent good money on this so this is very frustrating. I’ve been using it for multiple months now trying to figure out if I’m missing something, but I think that’s just how it’s set up. I hope that Shark adjusts their software to allow for an entire home matrix cleaning option.","Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2024"

3,"Good for surface level cleaning, not great for baseboards...","We received this vacuum as a wedding gift and were extremely excited about it because we have two longer haired dogs (Australian Shepherds). First a foremost, the vacuum does a great job at surface level cleaning on a day-to-day basis. We have ""Bruce"" run throughout our house every-day to help mitigate the never-ending shedding of our dogs and it's very nice to have most of the surfaces free of dog hair. The vacuum doesn't do a great job on our rugs (which are relatively low pile) beyond a light cleaning (even on the maximum suction power). We largely expected this type of operation, so we still use a normal vacuum around the house roughly every 3-5 days to keep things cleaner. The original roller that came with the vacuum routinely got hair caught up in it; however, we ordered a replacement set with a ""hair cutting"" feature from another brand that significantly improved the maintenance intervals required. I strongly recommend cleaning out both the vacuum and base filters (metal, cloth, and foam) at least monthly to keep suction operating well.

Now for the not-so-good: This thing isn't as ""smart"" as advertised. You'd think by doing multiple mapping runs of a relatively small floor plan, the vacuum would be able to figure out where the walls are and plan accordingly - NOPE. Our vacuum basically operates by smashing itself into every possible baseboard/wall to blindly find its way around the house. As shown in the pictures, this has taken a toll on our baseboards. After reaching out to Shark for clarification on how this is supposed to operate, they basically gave me the run-around multiple times claiming that the ""mapping"" wasn't done correctly (it's re-mapped our floor plan 3 times). I've basically given up at this point and put felt pads around the vacuum to help protect our furniture and walls.

Overall, it does a fine job, but once this one craps out on us, we're going to upgrade to a higher tiered model that uses lidar for better mapping.","Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024"

2,A glitch in the Matrix,"Buggy software. Once, it decided to vacuum at 2:30am, waking up the entire family. Today, it cleaned 2 square feet and returned to base, despite being asked to vacuum several rooms (see photo). After mapping your whole house, if you move some furniture there's no way to re-map just one room -- you have to re-map the whole house, which means picking up EVERYTHING first. Cleaning performance is decent, but it lacks the air puff feature to get dust out of corners. The rotating brushes get snagged on even medium area rugs, had to buy replacements. If you have a shag area rug, you can exclude it on the map by dragging and pinching, but it's impossible to get the region exactly right so you'll have a foot around the rug which never gets cleaned, or the vacuum tries to clean the edge of the rug and gets snagged. Finally, Shark plays games with pricing, and the 50% off price is the rule not the exception. Worth it at 299, but there are better options.","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2024"

2,Fell apart after 1 year,"This robot vacuum was the answer to all my dreams, for the first 12 months. It cleaned well, even though it would get stuck a decent amount, that never really bothered me. My favorite aspect was the Spot clean option that you could control from the app. It was spectacular and so easy to use. I never had an issue with the app communicating to the device. BUT THEN one day I started getting the Cliff Sensor Error (Code 7) and have never been able to get past it. I cleaned the sensors, with every possible solution. Nothing. I have tried to reset the robot. Nothing. I have tried to override the sensors by covering them up. Nothing. The robot will not budge because it thinks it is on a ""cliff."" While trying to troubleshoot I realized the black strip on the front as coming up, after trying to fix that, the entire thing just came off, and all the plastic brackets broke off as well. I am actually so sad, I loved this robot until now.","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024"
2,It will (kinda) work if you help it along,"Grading system disclaimer:
1 star: Does not do its job correctly and/or breaks too often to be worth it or useful. Wholeheartedly don't recommend purchasing
2 stars: Barely does its job correctly and/or breaks too often to be worth it or useful. There are some saving graces
3 stars: Does its job adequately and well. Didn't have any issues at all until at least a year after first using it. I will come back and amend a review if the item starts to fail sooner than it should
4 stars: Does its job well and even surprised me
5: Does its job exceptionally well and/or is more durable than what its price-point should suggest. Absolutely endorse this buy

I'm not sure why this is called ""AI Ultra"" because while it does map out the area it will still try to shove its face into everything which you can hear the attempt. It often goes to an area that I don't want it to or I will have an area mapped out that i want to clean but it decides to skip it.

I usually only let it vacuum while I'm home because i have to literally stop to guide it or move it off any obstacle that isn't nailed down. The suction itself is less than a handheld stick vacuum. I know this because i tested it once and I picked up even more dog hair.

The water carrying compartment often leaks water which will cause problems if it gets onto the charging contact points.

In less than a year I have had this replaced twice and both times have been a hassle. They did ultimately decide to replace it both times but IT IS NOT FREE. You have to pay for shipping which must be the most expensive shipping option for something that takes 3-10 to arrive.

The most recent experience of troubleshooting goes like this: first call lasts about an hour of doing several things of trying to fix it which ends in recommending buying a new battery which btw IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY. They suggest that i buy a new battery. Just so everyone is aware I was quoted ~$80 to buy the battery on the phone. Amazon sells the shark branded batteries for ~$60 but there are plenty of compatible batteries online for ~$20. After purchasing the battery I called back and spent 30 mins explaining to them that I have already troubleshooted, bought and replaced the battery and still had issues. They told me that i had to go through the physical troubleshooting again so i called back the next day and DID DO TROUBLESHOOTING AGAIN. They did charge for shipping yet again which is a frustrating. Eufy is a direct competitor to this and I have had minor issues I could explain on the phone but never had me start a video call to go through a litany of troubleshooting measures. If i didn't already spend money on this unit I would switch. Might still end up switching if it breaks again after the warranty expires. FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE. If you're going to charge $400 DO BETTER.","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2024"
2,Too many error messages.,"This vacuum has proven to be more troublesome than I thought it would be. Set up is fairly easy, but trying to get it to vacuum where you want it to and when you want to proves to be problematic. If you were to watch it perform you would think that it was confused: spinning in circles, constantly bumping into the same object and sending out too many error messages. The final straw was when I propped it to clean it tells me it needs to be moved to a level surface. Mind you this is the same level surface that it has been on since the purchase and has left the dock just fine. There have been a few instances where I receive an error message that says “I’m stuck please move me to a different area.” Other error messages are “my battery power is at 5%. Please move me to the dock“. The most interesting error message was that it felt that it was near a cliff where there was no cliff. It does take an extra effort to prepare the home for continuous vacuum use, so shoes, wires toys, etc.. All need to be removed from the ground. It will climb over some thin wiring, for example, the power cord to a reclining chair but there was one instance when it did so it pulled the power source out of the wall outlet. If you have seasonal decorations on the floor (as my wife does for every season) that are fairly lightweight, you will find they get pushed around, forcing you to return those items to their original places. Bottom line is that it is more trouble than it’s worth, forcing you to follow it around to make sure that it’s not stuck or running out of power or pushing things around the house.

I was going to purchase a replacement brush roll from Shark but there’s not one available. I’m very disappointed in this purchase and would not recommend this model.","Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2024"
2,"Can't map multiple levels, hair gets wrapped around brush roll","For the main level of our house, which is mapped, it does a good job. However, it cannot map multiple levels of the house. So you can bring it upstairs or to the basement and press clean, but it goes around randomly, repeating some areas multiple times and completely missing large areas. For the price I'm really disappointed that it does not have this feature.

It also claims to have a self-cleaning brush roll. This is definitely not true – I have to cut off hair at least once every time it runs.","Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2024"
2,Brushroll is stuck!,Keeps coming up with the #4 error. Brush roll is stuck! Need to clean brush roll. But I clean it and it comes right back with same error.

It hasn't gone more then 2 feet in 6 months!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2024"
2,Unsatisfied,"I search for the best rating robot vacuum before purchasing the ""Shark"". It had 5 stars. I was excited to get it also for the self emptying feature. But I'm not satisfied with performance. It misses places and doesn't pick up billed up hair as it should be. It just doesn't seem to have power. I regret in buying this product. I wish I can return it and get a better one that picks up the dog hair.","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024"

Their policy is the buyer has to pay for shipping of $25. Also, they will not renew the warranty on the second vacuum so if it breaks down I will be out of luck. This is a very expensive investment so you should look into purchasing an extended warranty when it’s offered at the beginning. Giving two stars because I expected the product to last longer than 9 months, I have to pay for shipping, and because they cant guarantee/warranty the replacement vacuum. If I have to purchase a new vacuum I will look for another brand.","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024"

2,Works great- when it works,"I absolutely love the mapping feature compared to the ""dumb"" robot I had before. But after a few months, it wouldn't run because it thought the sidebrush was stuck. Customer service is only open certain hours and the robot kept dying because it would run just a few inches - enough to leave the charger and then get the error again. When I finally got ahold of customer service, they agreed to replace the main vacuum part, but I had to pay $11 for the shipping. Why am I paying because their product is defective?

Bought it for my elderly parents' living room since they have hairy pets and a rug (worse combination possible) so I needed a device with max power. This does the job and I've scheduled it to clean the house twice a week and its unbelievable! Nevertheless, mapping the house has been a pain and the fact that you can't move the station from the place without having to remap everything again from scratch is horrible. You cant have more than one map either so if you have 2 floors or more in your house bad luck for you! Same can be said for myslef as I wanted to buy another shark model for my own home but cant have it in my phone since I would have to delete my parents map... The device doesn't necesarily respect or follows the map accordingly (I've blocked the bathrooms and kitchen in the app map but it still goes in those areas whenever it feels like it). It does fill up its internal storage quite quickly so be aware of cleaning it in time.","Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2024"

You can only schedule one clean a day for 1 time and your choice is on or off for that date and set time. You can set weekends different than weekdays ect. The few notifications it sends are always hours delayed.

2,Disappointed but think it is still nice!,"Ordered this vacuum as it had good reviews and at a good price; however, I found that it wasn't very functual for us in rural Arkansas with slow internet. We only get about 10 gbs and I think this may have been part of our problems. We also have frequent power outages which required it to be rebooted to our router. It was very slow to connect with our router and it was fully charged at this time. After finally getting it connected, I let it totally map our small house of app. 1200 sq. Ft. The first few days it worked pretty well on normal power setting. Then a brief power outage required a new internet connection. This time, using the app on my phone, I asked it to vacuum only half the house. It became totally lost and really didn't do much of anything. Sent it back to dock and had to clear the old map of our house and let it remap the area again. It would do pretty well on whole house setting, although it would miss a room most times. Eventually it would get totally lost and I would hit return to dock and my phone app showed it to be docking, which it never did. I found myself spending way more time preparing the area for it to work, and then finding it getting lost and doing one area over and over....bottom line I have become very frustrated with it and the time it takes to run it, not to mention maintaining keeping the dust ben, filters, rollers, etc. clean. Staying with my old vac. Maybe it is great with decent internet. My brother lives in a city with strong internet and loves his.

2,Mixed review,"Some of the positives of this Shark vacuum cleaner. First it does a good job of cleaning. We typically run it 3 times (or more) per week. We previously had a Roomba and can tell you the Shark is much quieter than the Roomba. We also like that the Shark maps the house and cleans in a pattern. While the Roomba simply wanders around, bumping into everything, you can direct the Shark to clean a specific room or area. The self-emptying function is a plus and well worth it, something we did not have with the Roomba.

The bad: We purchased the Shark 7 months ago and it is now dead. While Shark is going to replace the robot, we are being charged shipping and it will be 2 - 4 weeks before it is replaced. In our opinion $300.00 is just too much if it is only going to last 7 months.","Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2024"

Next I did the room explore and setup the rooms. That was easier then I thought it would be.
No here is where the fun begins.
The robot would not go between the love seat and the coffee table, even though there is plenty of room.
Next we get to the dinning room, it won't clean under the chairs or the table. Again, plenty of height and room for it to pass but jsut won't go, so I delete rooms and statrt over.
Same issues , so I try it for the third time and still won't work.

Eventually, it got a perpetually stuck brush roll… or something to that effect to cause it to give “error number 4” at all times. I did all the troubleshooting options available from Googling, and multiple articles said that still getting the error at that point means it’s busted. While it did work, it often ran into phantom cliffs in the middle of rooms, which made the “set it and forget it” scheduling a little pointless. Does a pretty good job on hardwoods, but area rugs never really appeared to be vacuumed. The Shark app is also annoying in that it doesn’t let you schedule by room; it has to be everything. Do I regret buying it? Yes! I’ve also learned now that Consumer Reports gives pretty bad reviews of Shark robot vacuums in general.","Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2024"

We’ve had it for a little over 6 months now and the performance just keeps getting worse day by day. It gets stuck all the time and sometimes doesn’t even notify you. The app doesn’t give you the option to run it more than once a day. It’s also running into things all of the time and continues to run into the same thing over and over again like it’s fixated on that one spot.

2,Update after regular use,"Original review below, but I've had it for a short while now and I must admit buyers remorse. I'll be saving up to replace this with a roomba.

This vacuum does the wrong thing over half the time, i.e. I tell it to clean the kitchen floor and it does 3 other rooms randomly without ever going into the kitchen. And it will go over a carpet 3 times and still leave crumbs behind. It cannot get edges at all and takes forever to charge. This was a true waste of money. Don't waste yours like I wasted mine. 😑

.....

Overall I'm quite satisfied. I tend to like Shark brand vacuums so when my Roomba finally died after many years of awesome cleaning I thought I'd try this. Here are the main differences between the two:

Shark runs quieter than my old Roomba.

They both hit all the rooms without issues.

Roomba mapping in the app is better for more precise control of the room dividers.

This guy is missing the front spinning brushes my Roomba had which definitely leaves much to be desired in edge cleaning along my kitchen cabinets.

Not having to buy vacuum bags is great.

Shark cleans the room quicker with no obvious difference in the amount of pet hair and debris picked up.

Roomba recharged faster but Shark seems to be able to clean more rooms on a single charge.

Will I buy another Shark when this guy dies? Probably, but I'll look for a model with edging brushes.","Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2024"
2,Broke after 7 months :(,"It was great…until it wasn’t. My vacuum completely stopped working. It thinks it’s getting stuck every time it starts to move for a second. I’ve done all the troubleshooting and research and cleaned and replaced all the parts I could, but no luck. Sad and disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2024"
2,Leaves Stuff Behind: Does Not Clean Edges,"Jeepers... to say I am disappointed is an understatement. Shark service was great... but I know this is ultimately either a design issue, or the min-brushes which are supposed to sweep items into the roller are not to specification. Neither a good way to start. (LOVE their vacuums, however)

As you can see from the photos, the cleaning rollers are smaller that the diameter of the unit. However the overlap is generally quite good. Having said that tho... it means it runs a lot longer and the battery does not last for a full house cleaning, or even the 2 hours it says it should. It is supposed to go recharge itself (I didn't pay attention if it did or not) but when I ran it the 1st time today, it did not do the whole house; missing rooms it had mapped out just the night before.. It did find its way back to the charging station.

The serious issue is that the mapping feature and/or laser-eye seems to stop the unit from hugging the molding. This, coupled with the brushes not extending to the widest sides of the unit (beyond the wheels) means that the edges of the carper do not get cleaned! Given this is designed/marketing for if you have a pet, we know this is a big deal.

My much older, Roomba i-Robot does a great job of edges and corners. (refer photos) It, however, will just die someplace if it runs out of battery as it doesn't know where the station is unless somewhere near it.

The brushes on the Roomba are longer, stiffer, and have a support 'tube' keeping them engaged much better. AND there are 3. Shark has only 1, and after the mapping and 1/2 cleaning the one already took a set.

The Roomba brushes have a yellow base. You can see they extend well beyond the wheels. The Shark's have a black base. Unless the brushes are beyond the unit's edge, it cannot clean the below the molding. The Shark leaves at least a 1/2 - 3/4 inch gap that is not cleaned. The Roomba is pretty much 'snug'.

Both the Roomba and Shark run in a single direction, yet the Roomba brushes still stick out straight have LOTS of cleaning trips.

OH WOW. While writing this the Shark was recharged and seems to be completing the rest of the cleaning tho it is more than 2 1/2 hours later and not necessarily a convenient time.

Shark is sending me new brushes in case the length of the brushes are shorter than the spec calls for. If not, it will have to go back as it is not at all able to do what it is supposed to.

Relative to the Roomba (which is around 4 years old) the Shark IS quieter and it's very nice to have it empty itself, versus every time I ran/run the Roomba. BUT.. the Shark left bits of lint or paper on two different rugs. They were not stuck-in and should have been picked up. (refer the photo of the rust and black geometric rug) Hence it does not clean nearly as well as the Roomba even with a well-used rubber-brush and regular brush. Meaning the Roomba has two; not the single one as in the Shark.

The mapping was less than spectacular. The 1st time it got into some sort of a do-loop and kept mapping a corner of the living room behind a chair. It needed to be recharged and I had to delete the map and start over. As this is an hour job (not the 30 - 45 they say unless you live in an 800 sq ft bungalow) So it was an inconvenience tho not a show stopper.

I always pick up small stuff (pails under my office desk, foot rests, rugs with long fringe). I don't pick up 4-legged chairs or office chairs. The Roomba seems to just figure its way around them after circling the legs 360 degrees. The Shark seems to bounce off them and not always come back. These chairs were taken off the floor during the 'map'. And in any event, even if they had been left in place, they would not be in the exact same place each time. So the programming should be able to handle it.

(Just went to check on the Shark..... it IS in fact noodling thru the rooms it did not do prior.. So its okay.
I just wish the battery were lasting longer.)

For while today I ran both. brands It was pretty funny when off-video they ran into each other. I feel a bit sorry for the Roomba. Older, a bit dustier, noisier and fighting for its vacuum-cleaning life. (lol). But it does a better job, truth be told.

I'll give the Shark a 2nd chance when the brushes arrive. If it solves the 'edge cleaning' and middle-room cleaning, I'll keep it. But speaking of brushes, I hate that it takes a special tool to get them on/off... something I didn't realize when I threw the tool that came with it. I have a bi-zillion Allen Wrenches and Phillips Screwdrivers, even of the same size. But it seems to be a Star-wrench(?). So I can't put the Roomba brushes on (and which look like would fit!). Hopefully the new brushes will come with the tool.

Okay. So my thoughts? It needs to work better once the brushes go in, else it will have to go back as is does NOT clean well, and especially not pet hair since, as those of us with pets know, the fur congregates in the corners and up against the walls.","Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2024"

I was very underwhelmed by the app features, mapping,and in it's vacuum bin size(tiny) personally I have one that rhymes with hoborock and never had any of the issues I encountered with this (actually there weren't any issues) it never forgot where the dock was, never died in the middle of returning to dock, much more intuitive room setting up and in general better app features, and the dust bin never overflowed, and it works in the dark.

2,Connected to base to fully charge only 1 time,"It only docked and charged fully 1 time. Subsequent uses, never docked and charged adequately. It would die before finishing part of 1 room. Directions are useless, no troubleshooting help. I prefer to read good directions, not watch videos. The videos I did watch didn't help resolve the issue. I can't address the other features, since the cleaner wouldn't charge enough to determine those qualities.

2,Meh performance for the high price point,"If you have pets, then this is not the vacuum for you. It will vacuum up pet hair, but unless you are cleaning it out/removing the hair every 3 minutes while it is vacuuming then it will stop, error out and then you'll have to take it apart to remove all the hair. The self-empty base doesn't have powerful enough suction to remove the pet hair either, so a lot of time is spent cleaning out both units. I gave up using it on a regular basis and now use it for spot cleaning. I purchased a regular Shark vacuum, and it works perfectly, so this robotic vacuum not working as it should is very frustrating.","Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2024"
2,Vacuum returns to docking station at 40% for no reason.,"I wish I knew why this thing works so badly. I started it at 100%, within 45 minutes it was down to 40%, then it returned to docking station. It unloaded its material which was hardly anything. Then it returned to the room it had just left. WHY did it go back to the dock at all? It goes over spots more then once. It does not vacuum the rooms efficiently. It wastes time going around objects and then incorrectly continuing on its path. It incorrectly scanned a room and doesn't vacuum it properly. I will have it reexplore the house and if it doesnt work better its going back. Also after it scanned the house you are unable to select a room to its exact dimensions, you can only select a square and hover over the section you want cleaned which usually means your cleaning parts of the another room????","Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2024"

You cannot schedule by room and you can’t schedule more than one cleaning per day. The app doesn’t communicate with the vacuum half the time. There is a plastic piece inside the dust bin off the vacuum that stops it from emptying correctly so I still have to manually empty it and I’m still vacuuming every day with a regular vacuum.

The second year it started losing its program and was regularly lost or stuck in places it had maneuvered fine before. The 3rd year it became more of a joke as to where it would get lost (we have a small 1200sf home).

I've uninstalled and re-installed the app 100x and it wont do anything. Also forget trying to pair it with Alexa. The bin constantly comes off too when going over something like a thin rug. It's also VERY loud when it gets to dock and empties. To empty the bin when it gets full is another challenge. You have to almost pry it open and hope dirt don't go flying everywhere, putting it back on the dock is another issue in itself.

2,It's ok ... until it isn't,"Great suction!
Apart from that, it does not obey no-go lines and it does not avoid objects. It frequently gets stuck on large dog toys (balls and kongs). It also recently made some poop art, a collaboration with the new puppy who happens to also be an escape artist.

2,Don't complicate things. Know what you are buying:,"We've owned three automated vacuums. The first two were fine. This one empties itself, kinda. Just know there are several filters that have to be changed, often, often, and often. The ""self emptying"" process starts to stink after about a week. Our old ones had one filter but needed just a bit more cleaning afterwards. This one requires very much more maintenance. It says its good for pets but its not. It clogs up fairly quickly. The smallest leaf or obstruction causes an ""error #9"". It'd probably be fine without pets or plants around your house but it clogs up easily. I'll keep it simple going forward. I can empty my own bin each time.","Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2024"

2,Not Great,"I purchased this robot thinking it was on sale (deal). I paid $318 after taxes. I was interested in the features of ‘large capacity’ trash container and pet hair pick up. We have a black lab who sheds like mad. For reference, our home is almost 3k square feet and all bare floor (wood and tile). We have 2 area rugs, a small one by the door and a large round one in the bar/sitting area.

The ‘large capacity’ is a joke. I have to empty the trash bin container after every time the robot runs. It’s small. It’s horrible at picking up the pet hair, just pushes it towards the walls and doesn’t pick up. One of the little collector brushes on the robot broke off the first time it ran. It DOES NOT WORK ON RUGS OR CARPET. The robot simply deposits pet hair from the bare floor onto the rugs in clumps. I still have to vacuum behind this thing. Waste of your money. Keep saving up and buy a better robot with an actual large capacity bin that will truly pick up pet hair. This one is not great. At all.","Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2024"

2,It's died in less than a year and has been less than stellar,"If I hadn't got this on a 50% off sale, I'd be spitting mad right now.

First, if you have a dog that sheds a lot, this is NOT the product for you. I have a yellow lab who sheds badly, and I had to take the roller apart after every cleaning to pull out the backed up piled of compacted hair. The 60 day capacity? Forget it - I had to empty the can after every second cleaning.

The suction on carpet, again with pet hair, isn't great. On hard floors, no complaints at all. Navigated mats without problems, though it did fight with my dog's water bowl (what a mess) and I had to put bowls up during cleaning.

All of this said, I have used the vacuum maybe 20 times tops, in part because my dog is terrified of it, and in part because it's a pain in the rear cleaning the roller and pulling all the wadded up hair out every time. I purchased on December 7, 2023 and as of yesterday (November 10, 2024) all the lights are solid red, and the unit is completely unresponsive despite the app not showing any warnings. I tried to contact Shark using the online chat, it indicated a 17 minute wait, and the sharply disconnected my and told me to call them when they hadn't responded to the chat after 17 minutes. What the heck!

It’s supposed to not have to be cleaned or emptied for a month, but I have to clean it every time it runs. It does a decent job on just dirt on hard floors, but seems to do next to nothing on my rugs, and like I said, actually leaves rugs dirtier. I wish I could return it or sell it.

1,Not durable and poor mapping,"This unit has always had one problem or another. As a result it would vacuum on occasion, but not at all reliably. The biggest problem is that after about 6 months (1-2 months of which it didn't run at all), it started regularly giving errors about the bumper being stuck. Yes there is a process to clean the sensors. However i started having to do this in about a weekly basis. Also since it has never really mapped out my house, I eventually test the map for it to remap from scratch. Since then it has never been able to actually create a new map and just drives aimlessly. The dust bin says it is full when it is not, so it stops randomly if it hasn't already stopped fit the ""stuck bumper"". Just completely useless for what was paid for it.

I'm really frustrated as we live in the country with time floors and when it worked, it was great for picking up the daily sand and dirt that gets tracked in from us and the pets.

Update: I've reduced it to one star. It has been failing with even more issues and it is effectively completely non-functional. The front bumper has a shield that has fallen out, so the sensors are now exposed, and seem to also be failing. Also after moving the base location to allow it to be more central in the house, it failed to generate a new map. Now after having had it powered off for a month, I went to try setting it up again, and the app has forgotten the robot, and can't even reestablish a Wi-Fi connection even though everything else is working fine.

I asked them to replace my 3 month old robot and they were not willing. This thing is very expensive, unsupportable, hot garbage. I'm going to buy a Hoover now.","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024"
1,"I hate this vacuum, constantly breaks","I absolutely hate this vacuum and it was a complete waste of $250. Less than a year into owning it stopped running the blueprint of our house and would only go to ""living room"". 5 feet from anything in any direction. After working with Shark on repeatedly phone calls to reset the firmware it worked again for about a month. Then it went completely dead all together unable to detect that it was on the charger and unable to charge at all. One day this week it sparatically turned on again and charged. Once again it only detects ""living room"" and not the other 3 rooms. This thing is a complete piece of garbage.","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024"
1,Not good with pet hair!!,I bought this mainly for pet hair. Its supposed to have the tangle free roller. From day 1 I would have to go around the house and pick up piles of dog hair. 2 weeks in and I came home to the device dead on the floor and the roller stopped up. There wasn't anything in the bin. Don't bother with this. It's too expensive to be so ineffective.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2024"

1,Buggy Firmware,"The convenience of this product is great, if only it would work properly. It frequently tries to run outside of the scheduled hours, even at 3am for example. I’ve had to resort to using smart plugs to disable it in the evening. Even then, it’s impossible to keep this product running on a consistent schedule. This seems to be a major firmware bug with no way to update it.","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024"
1,Worked decently for 2 whole months before it quit,"For two months, I loved this robot vac. It worked great, picked up tons of dog hair and made my life easier. Until it didn't. It now gives the ""disconnected"" message, I've tried reconnecting, and so far nothing works. I will now try connecting through a ""new robot"" process and if that works I will upgrade my rating to two stars and no more, since I feel I shouldn't have to do that process with a fairly new purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024"

1,Worst robot vacuum I've ever owned,"This had great reviews and I caught it on sale, but very quickly it became apparent the vacuum was vastly inferior to other models I've used. In a year it's been inert a majority of the time, because when it runs it's bad at vacuuming, it gets stuck on the tiniest rug edge, can't come close to a bathroom rug without eating it and dying, and gives constant errors. Now with the latest app update it's completely inoperable. Based on cost and usage I probably paid about $5 per hour of operation for this utterly worthless product. Hard do not recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024"

1,Doesn’t work and customer service is entirely unhelpful,"It doesn’t work on pet hair for carpets which is the main reason I purchased. It then stopped working all together and after a very unhelpful 30 minute wait listening to the most annoying voice recording I have ever heard approximately 100 times, a very unhelpful person informed me it was my fault for not knowing that in addition to regularly cleaning the brush roll I’d have to also pull out the pin which was stuck to its base. Because I ordered this thing on AMAZON shark wouldn’t replace the brush roll so after spending over $300 on a machine that is over $500 full price, I will have to replace the brush roll for a vacuum cleaner that doesn’t work for the primary purpose I purchased it for. 0 stars. I guess I’ll get one of the even move expensive robots next time.

Instead of cleaning only the necessary area, it cleaned the whole area every time, which was more than I needed. Then, suddenly, it stopped working. It took us quite a while to figure out how to get it to display an error message, which allowed us to identify the issue. It turned out that a small piece of hair was causing the problem. Unfortunately, by the time we found the issue, it was past the return window.","Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2024"

1,Terrible Experience,"We have just purchased our first house and with 2 dogs we knew a robot vaccum would be a great fit with our very open floor plan and Hardwood surfaces throughout our home. We purchased this because We have heard of some great experiences, but unfortunately this was not the case for us:/ We had our robot vaccum running for about 3 weeks until one day I came home to what seemed for it to be bead in the middle of the room. After some checking and placing it back on its charger it kept giving and error number 6 (bumper Stuck) We tried EVERYTHING you can think of to troubleshoot before lastly removing the bumper which was pretty easy to make sure everything was in order and in fact it was perfectly normal. I called customer service who was useless after being on hold for over 30 minutes. They told me they would have been happy to help but because I removed 5 little screws from the bumper all they could do was give a 10% discount from a 600 dollar value (it’s literally half that on amazon lol). So basically we got to three weeks from a vaccum that was mid (barely cleaned against the floor and wall) couldn’t get any help, and tried to get ripped off. Im not one to write reviews but this was simply terrible. I am going a different route and hoping for a better experience. I’m sure other work great but would have love to have some support not even a month after purchase. I’d seriously consider looking at others even if they are a tad more for a better product and better service.","Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2024"

The vacuum did not function. I was replacing a Shark Robot that I liked very much until it quit. Don't make my mistake and by used from Amazon. Amazon has changed for the worst.

My case was then passed to the software group. After waiting several more days they contacted me and had another video call to watch my unit malfunction. I was told I would need to send it back for replacement. This was now the middle of September. 10/13 I received an email that my order was cancelled and I would be refunded on 5-10 days.

1,Awesome if you enjoy being frustrated,"This thing worked amazing...for the first 6 months. The hardware works good, the vacuum portion does what it was designed to do. However, the software couldn't be worse. It constantly goes to the wrong area, or does 1/4 of the room you tell it to go to, then returns to its dock. It will even give you a report of the job it did, if I tell it to do the whole house, it's own report will show one or two single file passes through half of the rooms.
And when you call tech support, they have you rotate the map 180 degrees on your phone. This get the vacuum to work decent enough for you to end your conversation with them. Then it immediately stops working again. I like every other aspect of this vacuum though, the self emptying dock and hardware are awesome.
